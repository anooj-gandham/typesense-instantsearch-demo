When one large news outlet publishes a false story based on whispers from anonymous security state agents with the CIA or FBI, other news outlets quickly purport that they have xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d the false story, in order to bolster its credibility (oh, it must be true since other outlets have also confirmed it). This is an obvious scam xe2x80x94 they have not xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d anything but rather merely acted as servants to the same lying security state agents who planted the original false story xe2x80x94 but they do it over and over, creating the deceitful perception that a fake story has been \"confirmedxe2x80x9d by multiple outlets, thus bolstering its credibility in the public mind. It was the favored tactic for spreading debunked Russiagate frauds and is still used. One of the most vivid examples occurred in December, 2017, when CNN falsely reported what it hyped as \"a major bombshellxe2x80x9d: that Donald Trump, Jr. had advance access to the WikiLeaks archive. Within an hour, NBC Newsxe2x80x99 Ken Dilanian and CBS News both claimed they had xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d this fairy tale. When it turned out that it was a complete lie, all based on a false date on an email to Trump Jr., these outlets embarrassingly corrected it hours later and then simply moved on as if it never happened, never explaining how multiple outlets could possibly have all xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d the same blatant falsehood.On Thursday night, The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources (of course), claimed that the FBI gave a \"defensive briefingxe2x80x9d to Rudy Giuliani in 2019, before he traveled to Ukraine, that he was being targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign to hurt Joe Biden's candidacy, yet he ignored the FBI's warnings and went anyway. The Post also claimed that the right-wing news outlet OANN was similarly briefed. The claim about Giuliani not only predictably ricocheted all over social media and cable news xe2x80x94 where, as usual, it was uncritically treated as Truth xe2x80x94 but it was shortly thereafter xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d by both NBC Newsxe2x80x99 de facto CIA spokesman Ken Dilanian along with The New York Times.What was the problem with this story? It was totally false. The FBI never briefed Giuliani on any such thing. As a result, The Washington Post had to append this \"correctionxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 meaning a retraction xe2x80x94 to the top of its viral story:At first, The New York Times attempted to quietly change the story to delete the false claims without noting they were doing so. But upon being pressured, they finally faced up to what they did and posted their own retraction at the very bottom of the story that reads: xe2x80x9cCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated whether Rudolph W. Giuliani received a formal warning from the F.B.I. about Russian disinformation. Mr. Giuliani did not receive such a so-called defensive briefing.xe2x80x9d In their self-glorifying jargon, the Paper of Record did not spread Fake News xe2x80x94 perish the thought xe2x80x94 but merely \"misstatedxe2x80x9d the truth. Meanwhile, NBC News, at the top of its false story, posted this explanation for why Dilanian got the story completely wrong:An earlier version of this article included an incorrect report that Rudolph Giuliani had received a defensive briefing from the FBI in 2019 warning him that he was being targeted by a Russian influence operation. The report was based on a source familiar with the matter, but a second source now says the briefing was only prepared for Giuliani and not delivered to him, in part over concerns it might complicate the criminal investigation of Giuliani. As a result, the premise and headline of the article below have been changed to reflect the corrected information.This credibility carnage was so glaring that even CNN acknowledged that xe2x80x9cthe corrections are black eyes to the newsrooms which have aggressively reported on Giuliani's contacts with Ukrainians in his attempts to dig up dirt on then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.xe2x80x9d But there have been so many similar \"black eyesxe2x80x9d like this one, indeed far worse ones, over the last five years, and they never change anything that causes these \"black eyesxe2x80x9d because they want to do this: spreading disinformation is their function. Indeed, as I have asked almost every time these debacles happen: how is it possible that these same outlets keep \"confirmingxe2x80x9d one another's false stories? And the answer is obvious: they all serve as mouthpieces for the same propagandists and disinformation agents of the CIA, FBI and other security state agencies. In this capacity, they dutifully write down and vouch for what they are told by those agencies to publish without any investigative scrutiny or confirmation. The most amazing part of it all is that when they try to malign independent journalists for not doing \"real reportingxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 real reporting like these corporate outlets do xe2x80x94 this is what they mean by real reporting: getting a call from the CIA or FBI and being told what to say. And that is why they so often mislead and deceive the public with blatant disinformation in unison.It is hard to overstate how far and wide this false story about the FBI's briefing to Giuliani spread, how many millions of people it deceived. The two liberal cable outlets, MSNBC and CNN, instantly convened panels to analyze the grave implications of this revelation, accusing Giuliani of knowingly spreading Russian disinformation (by which they meant, as usual, truthful information that reflects poorly on Democratic Party leaders) even though he was told not to keep doing so by the FBI. As usual, the MSNBC program of Nicolle Wallace xe2x80x94 who has magically transformed from a disinformation agent for the Bush/Cheney White House into an identical disinformation agent but now for the DNC xe2x80x94 was one of the leaders in spreading this lie. She brought on former FBI agent and current MSNBC analyst Clint Watts to do just that (just as Wallace dramatized how Brian Sicknick died by falsely claiming that \"they beat a Capitol Police Officer to death with a fire extinguisher\" and repeatedly glorified Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) as a great and truthful leader on COVID): This is all par for the course. But in this case, dozens of journalists for NBC News, MSNBC, CNN and The Washington Post xe2x80x94 the very outlets that purported to \"confirmxe2x80x9d the false story xe2x80x94 as well as activists and scholars who purport to combat \"disinformation,xe2x80x9d spread it all over Twitter and, days later, have left it up, even knowing the story is false, while not even telling their followers that the story was false and has been retracted. In preparation for writing this article, I spent the day notifying close to a dozen of these media luminaries that their false tweet remained up and asked whether they intend to take it down and/or correct the false tweet. Only one xe2x80x94 NBC White House Correspondent Geoff Bennett xe2x80x94 responded. He did so by blocking me on Twitter, while leaving the false tweet up, uncorrected. Put another way, this NBC News journalist is well aware that he lied to close to 200,000 followers when he falsely told them that xe2x80x9cRudy Giuliani and Sen. Ron Johnson were warned in late 2019 that they were targets of a Russian operation intended to damage Joe Biden politicallyxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 a story (as it pertains to Giuliani) which even his own outlet has retracted xe2x80x94 but simply refuses to note that it was false or to remove the false posting. This NBC News reporter is knowingly spreading Fake News all over Twitter.The number of journalists with major outlets who spread this fake news and never corrected it is too high to comprehensively chronicle. But even when you tell them that the story they spread is false and that they never corrected it or deleted the false tweet, they just leave it up anyway: knowingly spreading lies. Basically as an experiment to measure how willing they are to knowingly lie even when caught, I sent a large number of them inquiries similar to the one I sent to NBCxe2x80x99s Bennett. With the exception of NBC's Bennett xe2x80x94 who blocked me but left up the lying claim xe2x80x94 virtually all just left their false tweets up with no notation to the people they lied to that the story was retracted. Here, for instance, are my similar interactions with Washington Post reporter Dan Zak, frequent Russia analyst for CNN and The Daily Beast Michael Weiss, CNN's Senior Global Affairs analyst Bianna Golodryga, and Bloomberg columnist Tim O'Brien, all of whom spread this story and have left it up uncorrected:Here is just a random sampling of five more people or sites who spread this lie all over the internet and refuse to take it down or tell their followers the tweet was false: MSNBC's ex-FBI agent Clint Watts, Washington Post reporter Greg Jaffe, Center for American Progress' Max Bergmann who runs the liberal think tank's \"Moscow Project,xe2x80x9d Nina Jankowicz: who says she \"studies disinformationxe2x80x9d(!)  for the Wilson Center, and the liberal \"newsxe2x80x9d site Raw Story:Meanwhile, MSNBC's Chris Hayesxe2x80x99 show, All In, has left up its tweet with the false story and refuses to take it down (though, after I shamed them for it, they finally noted in a subsequent tweet an hour or so ago that the story was retracted), while MSNBC's viral tweet with the false story also remains up:Perhaps the most extraordinary example is The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler. He is held out by that paper as its official \"fact-checker\": the person responsible for decreeing what is true and what is false. Not only did he post the fake claim about Giuliani's briefing, and not only did he never delete it or note that it was false even after his own paper retracted it and even after I advised him of this, but xe2x80x94 just two days ago! xe2x80x94 he endorsed a denunciation by CNN's Jake Tapper of an RNC official who tweeted out a story that turned out to be false (namely, that DHS was providing copies of Kamala Harrisxe2x80x99 book to migrant children). \"Says quite a bit that this tweet is still up even after the story was proven a lie,xe2x80x9d the CNN anchor reasonably said. Yet while Kessler endorsed that lecture, he himself did exactly the same thing: let stand a retracted story without removing the tweet or telling his audience that it was false:As I indicated, this is just a small sampling of journalists and activists who spread this false story and simply left the lie standing and uncorrected even after being advised. The list of shame also includes MSNBC's second-favorite neocon (after Bill Kristol) Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post. And while the false articles from the three outlets went viral, the tweets and other notations addressing the retractions were noted by only a tiny fraction who spread the original claim.Every journalist, even the most honest and careful, will get things wrong sometimes, and trustworthy journalists issue prompt corrections when they do. That behavior should be trust-building. But when media outlets continue to use the same reckless and deceitful tactics xe2x80x94 such as claiming to have xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d one another's false stories when they have merely served as stenographers for the same anonymous security state agents while \"confirmingxe2x80x9d nothing xe2x80x94 that strongly suggests a complete indifference to the truth and, even more so, a willingness to serve as disinformation agents for various official factions. And when a journalist spreads a false story and knows they have done so, but still refuses to correct it or remove it xe2x80x94 as is the case for many of the above examples xe2x80x94 then they are just tawdry liars who should be driven out of journalism. But they are not driven out and will not be because the reality is that their job is to spread disinformation as long as it is in servitude to the right factions (the CIA, FBI and DNC) and against those who are ideologically disfavored.Again we see the core truth of U.S. corporate journalism. The outlets that most vocally claim to condemn disinformation and fake news xe2x80x94 to the point of agitating in favor of corporate and online censorship of their critics and competitors in the name of combating it xe2x80x94 are the most prolific, aggressive and destructive disseminators of disinformation. Their refusal to remove the fake news here even after I explicitly notified them of it just makes this latest example a particularly vivid one.Update, May 3, 2021, 20:20 pm. ET: Subsequent to publication of this article, The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler posted a correction to Twitter:May 4th 2021This is not hard to do.

That happened due to allegations from a political consultant, Jean Kim, that Stringer groped her eighteen years ago, in 2003. Despite no evidence presented that any of this happened, and despite this being the only assault accusation ever voiced about Stringer during his decades in public life, and despite Kim never having once claimed any of this even when she was working for a rival candidate who was ultimately defeated in 2013 by Stringer, and despite the sudden emergence of this accusation as Stringerxe2x80x99s mayoral campaign was surging, and despite evidence showing that Kim was highly misleading in several of her statements, and despite Stringerxe2x80x99s claims that Kim had been his girlfriend for several months accompanied by vehement denials of wrongdoing, numerous leftist groups and politicians who had endorsed him repudiated his candidacy within days of the emergence of this allegation, issuing statements which treat Kimxe2x80x99s claims as proven truth and depict Stringer as a vile sexual predator. That is because, as has been seen repeatedly, the prevailing mentality in left-liberal politics is that even grave life-destroying accusations are to be treated as true without the need for any evidence. They casually and with apparent glee ruin peoplexe2x80x99s reputations and lives without batting an eye the second someone utters an allegation of sexual misconduct. And one is required to mindlessly accept such accusations as truth xe2x80x94 never ask for evidence if it is true xe2x80x94 if one wishes to remain in good standing in those circles and to avoid being smeared oneself as an apologist for sexual misconduct.To understand what is being done to Stringer, look at the identical smear campaign that Democrats launched in Massachusetts in August, 2020. Congressman Richie Neal (D-MA) is a walking embodiment of everything sleazy and slimy in U.S. politics. First elected to the House back when Ronald Reagan was still President, the Massachusetts Democrat, 72, is now in his 16th House term, and occupies the all-powerful position of Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which controls legislation governing revenue, taxes, social programs, and tariffs. Neal's entire career has been funded by large corporations, insurance companies and banks, and that is who he dutifully serves. He has used his immense power to block virtually every piece of legislation that his corporatist funders oppose but which left-wing populists favor. If you're on the left, and you actually think the political goals you claim are important, there would be few priorities more pressing than removing Congressman Neal from power.In 2020, the left was presented with precisely that opportunity. Over the past sixteen years, Neal has had no credible challengers in his Democrat-heavy district. But last year, 31-year-old Alex Morse xe2x80x94 a dynamic and gay five-term Mayor of Holyoke xe2x80x94 announced he would challenge Neal in the Democratic primary. Progressive groups lined up behind Morse with endorsements and donations, and polls began showing him closing in on Neal. This appeared to be one of the best opportunities in years to remove one of the sleaziest corporatists from power. But then the left sabotaged it. The College Democrats of Massachusetts released a perfectly timed letter accusing Morse of predatory behavior: namely, that he had sought sex with and dated young adults, and had consensual sex with several of them, including students at Amherst where he taught a class as an outside lecturer (such relationships are not banned by university guidelines). When launching these accusations, the College Democrats group also dramatically announced that they had banned Morse from attending any of their events, as if he were some sort of menace. There were no \"victimsxe2x80x9d claiming he had coerced let alone assaulted anyone. But no matter. Even as Morse denied wrongdoing, the same leftist groups and politicians which had endorsed him xe2x80x94 The Sunrise Movement, The Working Families Party, Justice Democrats, Rep. Jaamal Bowman (D-NY) xe2x80x94 quickly condemned him and renounced their support, said they were xe2x80x9cpausingxe2x80x9d their support, or demanded he xe2x80x9cmake meaningful efforts to repair any harm hexe2x80x99s caused.xe2x80x9d They had no need for any investigation let alone evidence: they were willing to endorse a narrative xe2x80x94 based on decades of bigoted stereotypes xe2x80x94 that a gay man was a sexual predator of young males, even if doing so meant returning Richie Neal back to his perch as Committee Chairman. The local Sunrise Movement group repudiated Morse in a statement that disgustingly proclaimed that xe2x80x9cwe believe all survivorsxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9crape culture runs deep in our societyxe2x80x9d: rape culture and survivors, for sex between consenting adults. Industry groups that long supporting Neal began plastering the airwaves with ads condemning Morse as a sexual predator who was exploiting his relationship with young men. And anyone who stood up to defend Morse and demand evidence of wrongdoing was vilified by the left as either an apologist for sexual predators or themselves likely some kind of pedophile. Those are the tactics the left uses to prevent anyone from demanding basic evidentiary support for accusations before they are used to wreck the lives of their targets. As Matt Taibbi observed in defense of Morse, much of this was just an extension of the now-standard left-liberal culture that casts adults as victims based on the flimsiest of claims:This terror of a world separated into victimizers and victims has already ruined journalism, where a new class of reporters is so locked into the idea that every second of airtime or line of an editorial is an exercise of power that theyxe2x80x99ve begun demanding the removal of alternative political viewpoints from their publications xe2x80x94 other ideas make them feel literally unsafe.The flamboyant insistence of these leftist groups that their causes (such as saving the climate) are global emergencies is a fraud, since xe2x80x94 based on the vaguest, most dubious and most trivial allegations xe2x80x94 they were willing to re-empower one of the worst corporatist obstacles to their supposedly urgent progressive goals. As The New York Times put it: xe2x80x9cwithin hours after the story broke, Mr. Morse went from role model to pariah. Progressive groups said they would stop campaigning for him.xe2x80x9dAs it turned out, reporters Daniel Boguslaw and Ryan Grim, working with others at The Intercept, uncovered conclusive evidence proving that the allegations against Morse were the by-product of a coordinated smear campaign engineered by state Democratic Party officials and opportunistic College Democrats hoping for a job with Neal. One of the conniving little ringleaders even purposely lured Morse into online discussions about dating by pretending to pursue him so that they could then weaponize those chats against him. One member of the College Democrats warned the group that they would be exploiting an age-old trope about gay men as predators, but they did not care. Destroying Morse was their only goal. Once Grim and Boguslaw revealed the truth, the College Democrats ended up apologizing to Morse. The State Party launched an investigation to determine who was to blame for this filthy smear campaign, and xe2x80x94 with Neal safely re-elected xe2x80x94 they issued a report admitting the State Democratic Party Chairman broke party rules with his involvement.But it was just pure luck that, this time, the evidence emerged proving that Morse was the victim, not the perpetrator. Had it not been for a brave student disturbed by what was being done, Morsexe2x80x99s life would have been ruined, forever plagued by false accusations of being a sex pest. Once that truth was reported, these leftist groups xe2x80x94 which had not bothered to wait for evidence before trying to destroy Morsexe2x80x99s reputation xe2x80x94 re-endorsed him, but by then it was too late. The damage was done. As The New York Times noted, xe2x80x9cPolitical careers usually donxe2x80x99t survive allegations like these.xe2x80x9d Neal cruised to victory by double digits, leading The New York Times to pose this question in its headline about Morsexe2x80x99s vindication:The answer, as it turns out, is a resounding no. It changed nothing. The left is yet again repeating its malicious destruction of a personxe2x80x99s reputation xe2x80x94 again, one of their own xe2x80x94 based on nothing other than evidence-free, highly opportunistic accusations. New York City Democrats are currently holding their primary election to select their candidate to run for Mayor. Given how blue the city is, it is highly likely the primary winner will become Mayor. For months, polls have shown two center-left candidates anathema to the city's progressives xe2x80x94 former presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Brooklyn Borough President and police captain Eric Adams xe2x80x94 in the lead. The only progressive candidate with any viable chance to win is Stringer, the former Manhattan Borough President and current City Comptroller. He has placed a strong third in most polls behind Yang and Adams, and has been closing in on Adams.The recognition that Stringer is the only left-wing candidate with a viable chance to beat the two centrists has resulted in a pile of recent endorsements from many of the same progressive groups and politicians who hopped on board the Morse train, including the Sunrise Movement, the Working Families Party and Rep. Bowman. The latest poll shows Stringer in third place, the only candidate other than front-runners Yang and Adams with double digits. All other candidates xe2x80x94 including the other two progressive candidates: Maya Wiley and Dianne Morales xe2x80x94 are well behind, bunched together in single digits.But Stringerxe2x80x99s candidacy suffered a likely fatal blow last week when a woman named Jean Kim xe2x80x94 who Stringer says was a former girlfriend xe2x80x94 claimed that eighteen years ago, in 2003, the candidate xe2x80x9crepeatedly groped me [and] put his hands on my thighs and between my legsxe2x80x9d without her consent. Just as was true with Alex Morse, this accusation suddenly materialized, said The New York Times, right xe2x80x9cas he had appeared to catch momentumxe2x80xa6.In a number of recent polls, Mr. Stringer had appeared to be virtually tied or just behind Mr. Adams.xe2x80x9d Kim never once, over the last eighteen years since this assault allegedly happened, voiced these accusations publicly xe2x80x94 even as Stringer ran for numerous high political offices, winning many elections. In a press conference alongside his wife of eleven years, Elyse Buxbaum, Stringer vehemently denied the allegations, explaining that he had dated Kim for several months many years ago and remained friendly with her until 2013, when she became angry with him when he refused her request for a job in his successful citywide campaign for City Comptroller, and so instead went to work for his opponent, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. There is zero evidence to support Kimxe2x80x99s accusations against Stringer. No other woman has accused him of similar behavior either before or since. And Kim said nothing even when, after having her job request rejected by Stringer, she went to work for Stringerxe2x80x99s main opponent in the 2013 Democratic primary for Comptroller, where such allegations obviously would have helped Spitzer avoid his ultimate defeat to Stringer. By contrast, there is evidence to affirmatively create at least rational doubt about whether any of this happened. When Kim first came forward, she claimed she was Stringerxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cintern,xe2x80x9d to create the perception that Stringer had exploited a young, deeply vulnerable woman the way Bill Clinton did in the Oval Office with then-22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinksy. That framing predictably caused newspaper headlines all over the city to use this narrative of vulnerability (xe2x80x9cFormer Campaign Intern Accuses Scott Stringer Of Sexual Abuse, Harassmentxe2x80x9d) only for it turn turn out that Kim was thirty years old at the time. Kim also denied that she had sought employment with her supposed abuser in his 2013 race, only for Stringer to produce an email she had sent along with her resumxc3xa9 doing exactly that. Moreover, as Substack reporter Michael Tracey documented, Stringerxe2x80x99s accuser xe2x80x9cis a registered lobbyist in New York and has a previous business relationship with one of his rival NYC mayoral candidates, Kathryn Garcia (who swiftly called on Stringer to drop out of the race).xe2x80x9dBut none of this mattered to the same leading left-wing groups and politicians who instantly abandoned Alex Morse as soon as those allegations emerged. That is because in left-wing political culture, evidence is not needed for accusations to be deemed true and to be used to destroy a personxe2x80x99s reputation built over decades. Just like free speech, they do not believe in due process when it comes to vilifying someone publicly xe2x80x94 at all xe2x80x94 nor do they recognize the importance of not assuming someone guilty without evidence. They are tyrannical cowards who, sheep-like, jump into line the minute they hear an allegation of this type and repudiate the person accused without the slightest regard for whether he actually did anything wrong. They are too afraid of the recriminations from suggesting that evidence should be required.As a result, within days of Kimxe2x80x99s accusation about what happened in 2003, many leading left-wing groups announced they were withdrawing their support for Stringer. Worse, they issued statements in which they took the truth of these accusations for granted xe2x80x94 exactly as they did to Alex Morse xe2x80x94 and in which they all but accused Stringer of being a predator and sexual abuser. Left-wing state legislators such as Julia Salazar, followed by Rep. Bowman, withdrew their endorsement. The climate group Sunrise Movementxe2x80x99s New York chapter announced that they xe2x80x9cstand with and believe survivors of violence of any kind, and that includes Jean Kim,xe2x80x9d and demanded Stringer xe2x80x9center a victim-informed restorative justice process, contingent upon Kimxe2x80x99s desires.xe2x80x9d Praising xe2x80x9cKimxe2x80x99s brave testimony recounting her trauma,xe2x80x9d the group said it xe2x80x9cimmediately rescinds our endorsement of Scott Stringer and calls for him to drop out of the race for Mayor of New York City.xe2x80x9d In its announcement rescinding their endorsement, the Working Families Party condemned Stringer because, they said, he xe2x80x9cfailed to acknowledge and consider his responsibilityxe2x80x9d for the harm he caused xe2x80x94 in other words, they were un-endorsing him because he had the temerity to deny that this actually happened.Do you see what is glaringly absent from these tribunals? There is no recognition of even the remotest possibility that the person may be wrongfully accused, innocent of what they are alleged to have done. In their orgy of self-righteous recriminations and ritualistic denunciations, that thought never enters their mind, nor does any requirement of evidence. Even after these same groups endured the humiliating spectacle of having ratified a bigoted and coordinated attack on Alex Morse as a sex predator only for them to have to have to reverse themselves and re-endorse him, they have learned nothing from that travesty because this is the predominant ethos of left-liberal culture.It should go without saying that none of this means that Stringer is innocent. Just as the accusers should not be presumed to be truthful, the same is true of the accused. Sometimes accusers lie and sometimes wrongdoers falsely deny wrongdoing. The point xe2x80x94 which is only controversial in contemporary left-liberal circles xe2x80x94 is that some convincing evidence is required before it is fair and just to destroy someonexe2x80x99s reputation and treat them as guilty.ShareThese are far from the only examples. The left did exactly the same thing to Nancy Pelosixe2x80x99s progressive 2020 challenger, the Pakistani-American Shahid Buttar. When unproven allegations emerged from several white women that Buttar was guilty of sexism and mistreatment of his staff, the left immediately sided with the white women, concluding that it would be better to send Pelosi back to her position as House Speaker and thus abandoned Buttarxe2x80x99s campaign. In July, The Intercept published an irresponsible article that gave voice to these allegations against Buttar, only to go back weeks later and quietly insert major new paragraphs that called into serious doubt the credibility of Buttarxe2x80x99s main accuser (an inserted note at the top of that article now simply states: xe2x80x9cEditorxe2x80x99s note: This article was updated to include additional context around the allegations made by [accuser] Elizabeth Croydon.xe2x80x9d Several of Buttarxe2x80x99s supporters accused the women of using racist tropes against Buttar. One said: xe2x80x9cThe Democratic Socialists of America San Francisco are about to ruin the political career of a Brown Muslim man based on no evidence at all because a bunch of mediocre Karens complained he was mean to them.xe2x80x9d Needless to say, when the stakes are high enough, progressives kick this framework of presumed-guilt and Believe-Women to the curb. When Joe Biden was the presumptive nominee against Donald Trump, they quickly vilified his accuser Tara Reade as a mentally unwell liar xe2x80x94 just as they did in the 1990s to the group of women who accused Bill Clinton of various levels of sexual impropriety, including rape. When something like the presidency is at stake, female accusers of key Democratic male leaders are to be mocked and destroyed, not believed.That is because there is no discernible principle at play. It is only about power. Why was the highly educated Christine Blasey Ford to be believed with no evidence in her accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, and why is Stringerxe2x80x99s accuser, political consultant Jean Kim, to be believed, but Reade was not, even though she had more evidence of contemporaneous complaints to support her allegations?But the far more important point is that any culture that is willing to destroy reputations and lives based on totally unproven accusations is one that is inherently corrupt and unjust. The ability to destroy someonexe2x80x99s life with nothing more than an uncorroborated claim voiced more than eighteen years after the alleged incident is a power with which nobody should be trusted.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I am perhaps a bit of a purist but I take offense at Greenwald's presumption that the people he's rightly critiquing are on the left.

Opening his address, Biden stated, \"I took the oath of office xe2x80x94 lifted my hand off our family Bible xe2x80x94 and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"Yes, the January 6th siege on the U.S. Capitol building, often alluded to as an \"insurrection,\" was an embarrassing day for our country. But to suggest that it was \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War\" is disingenuous at best. At worst, it's a malicious attempt to whitewash the history of attacks carried out both by and on the government that have had much more catastrophic results.Apart from the September 11th terrorist attacks that targeted the country's financial system, Al Qaeda terrorists attacked the defenders of our democracy when a hijacked American Airlines flight 77 flew into the Pentagon. Were it not for the heroes who resisted against the hijackers of United flight 93, Al Qaedaxe2x80x99s attempt to fly a commercial airline into the White House or U.S. Capitol building would have come to fruition. Despite being a horrific tragedy, 9/11 has been dismissed by some as being explicitly a \"foreign attack,\" not one from within.Subscribe nowSo, let's explore attacks on our democracy from within.Following 9/11, the Bush administration, in conjunction with Congress, expedited the passage of the Patriot Act, a wide-sweeping national security law that infringed on the civil liberties of every American in the name of fighting terror. The Fourth Amendment became a relic of the past as the government's power to surveil and spy on its own citizens reached its peak. Individuals who shared names with persons of interest or suspected terrorists, including U.S. citizens, landed on government no-fly lists, restricting their right to freely move about the country for dubious reasons and with no due process or recourse. And even worse, many had their right to due process eviscerated when they were detained by the newly-created Department of Homeland Security and found themselves at Guantanamo Bay without even being charged with a crime.Yet this is not the first time that American citizens, or even permanent residents for that matter, had their rights infringed upon by the government.As the FBI was formed in the early 20th century, Americans whose ideologies were at odds with the government's interests were often targeted by the agency's longest-serving director, J. Edgar Hoover. In the eyes of the FBI Director, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a suspected communist given his ties to Stanley Levison, whose suspected pro-communist activities were monitored by the FBI in the 1950s. Although Dr. King has been viewed as one of the most consequential leaders in American history due to his role in the civil rights movement, at the time, Hoover and many in the FBI viewed him as a threat to our democracy, ushering in communism under the guise of xe2x80x9ccivil rights.xe2x80x9d The FBI infamously blackmailed Dr. King by sending him a letter advocating he commit suicide. The Red Scare was so severe in the United States that the government actively sought to chip away at Americans' First Amendment rights to prevent the spread of such ideas. And through the Lavender Scare in the early 1950s, thousands of people were forced out of government service for simply for being suspected of being homosexual. When the United States entered the First World War, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Espionage Act of 1917 into law, which then gave way to the Sedition Act of 1918. These two laws worked in conjunction to strip away the First Amendment rights of every American and demand undying fealty towards the U.S. government. Expressing even the slightest bit of criticism of the U.S. or associating with groups like the Communist Party could result in, at the very least, a government wiretap, and, at worst, a hefty prison sentence and possible execution. In the same token that President Franklin Roosevelt interned approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II in fear that they might side with the Japanese Empire, the Espionage and Sedition Acts under President Wilson explicitly targeted German-born American residents during World War I, with over 2,000 arrested and sent to internment camps.While the FBI has had its fair share of attacking our democracy, its intelligence counterpart, the CIA, has interfered in the affairs of other countries countless times. As Americans decry countries like Russia, China, and Iran for interfering in our electoral process, the CIA has had a hand in interfering in the affairs of well over a dozen nations. For as many autocratic regimes as the CIA tried to topple in places like Cuba, Indonesia, and the Dominican Republic, the CIA had a hand in the overthrow of democracies as well in countries like Iran, Chile, and Guatemala.For decades, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover xe2x80x94 the notorious FBI Director after whom the law enforcement's DC headquarters continues to be named xe2x80x94 assaulted democracy in every way imaginable. Hoover kept dossiers on political leaders to enforce his will over them. FBI agents routinely infiltrated anti-war and civil rights groups as part of its COINTELPRO program and other similar domestic spying activities. And the NSA notoriously spied on millions of American citizens without warrants.There is a strong argument to be made that the CIA is responsible for interfering in American democracy, too.The first impeachment of President Donald Trump in 2019 occurred when a whistleblower within the CIA filed a complaint after Trump had a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, in exchange for $400 million in military aid.But it didn't end there.The story of the Russian Bounty program on U.S. troops in Afghanistan that broke publicly in the summer of 2020 made a significant impact in tipping the scales during the 2020 presidential election. The CIA produced the initial intelligence assessment in 2019, which later broke publicly in the summer of 2020, further cementing the perception that Trump was in the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putinxe2x80x93xe2x80x93a claim that was exacerbated when then-President Trump dismissed the allegations outright, calling it \"fake news.\" However, in April 2021, Trump would be vindicated as the U.S. government revealed that the Intelligence Community had \"low to moderate confidence\" in the intelligence assessment. In other words, there was little evidence to prove that it was real.On top of these government abuses that took place on a wide scale impacting every American, there was a long-drawn-out period since the Civil War that impacted millions of Americans that has had consequences that last to this day: Jim Crow.Following the Civil War and Reconstruction, the implementation of Jim Crow laws in Southern former slave states not only segregated black people from the white population, but also barred them from fully participating in society as equal members. Through policies like poll taxes, literacy tests, and increased residency requirements, black people had their right to vote stripped away, essentially removing them from the political process, keeping them further ostracized from society. It was authoritarianism in the most sinister manner, targeting a racial group that was perceived to be subhuman to their white counterpart, all in the name of protecting democracy.Despite all these examples in which our democracyxe2x80x93xe2x80x93and the democracies of other nationsxe2x80x93xe2x80x93were attacked with our government playing the central antagonist, there were a half dozen times where the sitting U.S. president and, by extension, our democracy were attacked from within. Since the Civil War, four U.S. presidents were assassinated (Lincoln in 1865, Garfield in 1881, McKinley in 1901, and Kennedy in 1963) and two presidents were injured in assassination attempts (Roosevelt in 1912 and Reagan in 1981). These were six attacks on the duly elected leaders of the people of the United States. Not only does changing the leadership alter the trajectory for a nation, but due to its status, it has lasting effects for the rest of the world.If President Biden is to suggest that the siege on Capitol Hill on January 6th was \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War,\" then we should demand that our leaders be honest about what does and does not constitute an \"attack on our democracy.\" Attacks on our democracy aren't just reserved for storming the U.S. Capitol and targeting U.S. lawmakers with historically low approval ratings. If that's the case, that a certain set of rules only applies to the political elite and not the people, then it's safe to say that we do not truly live in a democracy.Siraj Hashmi is a journalist based in Washington, DC. He is the co-host of Habibi Bros. with Mujahed Kobbe, and creator of the List.Subscribe nowFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Let's look at a few things: worst pandemic - a manufactured crisis that was mostly solved before he took office; worst economy - only bad because of government overreach in shutting down the economy; worst attack on our democracy - that's the most laughable.  The riot was \"kindergarten\" level stuff; Biden would freeze with terror if an attack on our democracy was carried out by even a JV team in comparison.There is one fact about January 6th that renders all the outrage bullshit, and I can't believe it gets so little attention.   That fact: some of the Capitol Police let the protesters in.Unpack that.   Imagine ANY protest that might happen at the Capitol -- BLM, anti-war, pro-Trump, climate change, etc. -- and ask yourself what would happen if the police stepped aside and said \"come on in!\"Some people would go in.   Always.   There you have it.   This one fact, that police INVITED people to come in, is both necessary and sufficient to create a so-called \"insurrection.\"   It would lead to the outcome we saw every time, with every protest, for any passionate cause.  Now if protesters came in with guns and started shooting police or members of Congress, then you would not have the conditions necessary and sufficient to create THAT outcome.   But that didn't happen.   What did happen would happen in any similar case.   People running around, cheering, and generally not knowing what to do with themselves.   And eventually leaving or getting arrested.  In short, this was MANUFACTURED.   The police hold 100% responsibility for the fact that the Capitol was overrun by a handful of protesters from a large group of protesters who decided to take the police up on their invite.   Their actions created the basis for sweeping narrative change, new security protocols, and novel legislation on domestic terrorism that we know was already being considered in the background, just waiting for a casus belli. This begs the question: did anyone who wanted this justification have any role in the Capitol Police decision to invite in the rabble?

No more hosannas to the creative destruction of the marketplace. Only mute submission to the magisterium of the Department of Consumer Affairs.Back in the 1980s, the City Council capped the number of licenses available to street vendors at just 5,100 - a fraction of what demand could support. For this reason, as many as 20,000 vendors across the city are forced to operate without the proper paperwork, risking confiscation of their inventory, heavy fines, and even jail time for the crime of selling things that other people want to buy. That number increased considerably last year as coronavirus-related shutdowns swelled the ranks of the unemployed. Being New Yorkers, many did what they had to do: adapt to survive.After years of delay, the City Council was finally forced to confront the need to regularize the cityxe2x80x99s sprawling informal sector. It passed legislation authorizing an annual increase in the licensing cap so that existing vendors could be gradually integrated into the formal market. Responsibility for enforcement was transferred from the NYPD to the Department of Consumer Affairs. It was all an elegant solution to one of the happier problems associated with New Yorkxe2x80x99s famously industrious population. Andrew Yang for President would have been proud. But Andrew Yang for Mayor was singing from a different hymnal. The former prophet of disruption now bowed before false idols of brick and mortar. Why?In the ensuing controversy, that wasnxe2x80x99t the question that most preoccupied Yangxe2x80x99s critics. They were more concerned with what his comment revealed about his character - lack of empathy for the downtrodden, or perhaps even latent racism against Black and brown street vendors. But that is a serious mistake. Not only is it alienating to voters who may identify with Yang, it's a missed opportunity to explain why, no matter how much they might like him, he will never identify with them.On February 25th, Yang toured the Flushing neighborhood in Queens accompanied by Timothy Chuang, co-chair of the Flushing Business Improvement District. BIDs are nonprofit entities that lobby for investment, subsidies, and favorable tax and regulatory treatment on behalf of local businesses and property owners in urban commercial districts. For many years, BIDs were a major opponent of raising the cap on vendor licenses, fearing competition from more nimble competitors with lower overhead costs and cheaper prices. The extent to which street vendors and traditional retailers actually compete for the same customer base is disputed, but the perception that they do is strong among New Yorkxe2x80x99s petite bourgeoisie. As unlicensed vendors multiplied during the pandemic, the Flushing BID expressed its displeasure over what it considered to be lax enforcement.Chuang made sure Yang heard that displeasure too. On their tour, they met with Flushing tea shop owner Samuel Lin, who leaned on Yang hard over the vendor issue:xe2x80x9cLin said that Flushing rents are expensive, and his two milk tea shops have to pay rent even if their business is damaged. But the unlicensed vendors on the street donxe2x80x99t have to worry about rent, sell cheaper goods, and sometimes even hinder traffic. It has a negative impact on the recovery of small businesses.xe2x80x9d [Translation from Chinese.]Yang seemed to take the hint. Unlicensed vending was the first thing mentioned when he tweeted about his visit later in the day. But perhaps because he didnxe2x80x99t describe xe2x80x9cenforcementxe2x80x9d as the solution to this problem hexe2x80x99d been hearing so much about, his remark drew virtually no attention at the time.Campaign finance disclosures show that Chuang gave $500 to Yangxe2x80x99s campaign two days before their tour. But given what he can command through online fundraising, Yang probably didnxe2x80x99t need Chuangxe2x80x99s money. What he really needs are outerboro Virgils to guide him through the inferno of neighborhood power brokers and validate him in the eyes of voters. The price is lip service to their various pet issues while on the campaign trial, and presumably, compliance with their demands while in office.Notably, Yangxe2x80x99s local guides donxe2x80x99t confine themselves to local politics. In September 2019, Chuang donated $1,000 to Ted Yoho, the far-right former congressman from Florida, perhaps most famous for calling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a xe2x80x9cfucking bitchxe2x80x9d in July of last year. Less well-known is that during his time in Congress, Yoho was a vocal advocate for Taiwan and an aggressive American posture toward mainland China. Chuang is a major figure in Flushingxe2x80x99s Taiwanese business community.A review of Yohoxe2x80x99s top 100 donors in the 2020 cycle reveals that Yoho and his longtime aid Kat Cammack, who succeeded him in Congress, together received nearly $20,000 in contributions from at least nine people in Flushingxe2x80x99s Taiwanese business community. All of them are major donors to Yangxe2x80x99s mayoral campaign. They include Jimmy Tsai and Warren Huang of Amerasia Bank, Ming Chiang of the Yu Shan Company, and Thomas Chen of Crystal Window and Door Systems Ltd - whose factory was the first stop on Yangxe2x80x99s tour of Flushing.A few days prior, Yang toured Chinatown in Manhattan and dined at the Hwa Yuan restaurant, an iconic Chinatown institution owned and operated by its head chef, Chen Lieh Tang. Joining Yang for the meal was James Tierney Tang, Chen Liehxe2x80x99s son, who serves on the Board of Directors of the Chinatown BID. Just like its counterpart in Flushing, the Chinatown BID emphasizes two issues it sees as the foundation of a successful commercial district: cleanliness and safety. Before the BIDxe2x80x99s creation in 2012, local residents and activists came together under the banner of the Coalition Against a Chinatown BID to express concern about its potential impact on their most vulnerable neighbors:xe2x80x9cThe 'clean and safe' programs that BIDs initiate to attract consumers can limit citizen voice and dislocate less desirable citizens through the privatization of public space. In some instances, allegations have been made that these programs involve the removal of the homeless and unauthorized vendors.xe2x80x9dUltimately, the BID was established anyway under the leadership of Executive Director Wellington Chen. In his most recent public interview, Chen can be heard pushing the xe2x80x98clean and safexe2x80x99 mantra used to justify the arrest and eviction of unlicensed Chinatown vendors for years, as well as bemoaning pending increases in New Yorkxe2x80x99s minimum wage. Chen gave $250 to Yangxe2x80x99s campaign in March 2021.But itxe2x80x99s Tangxe2x80x99s support that is particularly notable. On his Instagram, Tang captioned a photo with Yang taken on the day of his visit to Hwa Yuan with the following: xe2x80x9cHonored to host mayoral candidate, Andrew Yang! Even as a lifelong Republican, I have got his back! Hexe2x80x99s got New Yorkxe2x80x99s.xe2x80x9d The only other politician to have the honor of a photo op on Tangxe2x80x99s IG is Linsday Graham. The only NYC official to have the honor of his campaign contributions was Nicole Malliotakis, during her 2017 challenge to Bill de Blasio, whom he routinely excoriates over the problem of street homelessness on his Facebook. Tang donated $2,000 to Yangxe2x80x99s campaign in January 2021.Yangxe2x80x99s idea to bring the hammer down on old ladies selling jade earrings on Canal Street without a permit provoked intense backlash from New York progressives. The common refrain was that because unlicensed street vendors are almost exclusively poor people of color, such a policy would be racist - and implicitly, that Yang himself was racist for suggesting it. While racism isnxe2x80x99t a huge sin for the notorious consultants running Yangxe2x80x99s campaign, a bad news cycle certainly is.After a day of reflection with his confessors at Tusk Strategies, Yang received his penance: a public act of contrition before the media. xe2x80x9cI regret that I took on such a frankly complicated and nuanced issuexe2x80x9d online, he told reporters, and that he made it xe2x80x9cseem like itxe2x80x99s a zero-sum game between unlicensed street vendors and retailers.xe2x80x9dThat didnxe2x80x99t placate Scott Stringer, the cityxe2x80x99s Comptroller and Yangxe2x80x99s best-funded opponent, who held a press conference in the Hispanic neighborhood of Jackson Heights in Queens denouncing Yangxe2x80x99s remark as a racist attack on Black and brown New Yorkers. He was flanked by a woman holding a sign reading: xe2x80x9cmore churros, less cops,xe2x80x9d an allusion to the churro ladies who were arrested and hauled off from subway stations across the city in late 2019, Andrew Cuomoxe2x80x99s solution to a largely fictional crime wave roiling the cityxe2x80x99s tabloids.But an inconvenient fact for the race-reductionist narrative around this issue is that some of the strongest criticism of street vending, unlicensed or otherwise, comes from immigrant- and minority-owned small businesses. From the New York Postxe2x80x99s coverage of the decision to raise the licensing cap:xe2x80x9cMore than 150 food merchants and business groups sent a letter to Speaker Corey Johnson expressing opposition to the proposed law. Many of the signatories are members of the New York State Latino Restaurant, Bar and Lounge Association.One of them is restaurateur Sandra Jaquez, who owns Il Sole and Sa-Tacos eateries on Dyckman Street in Manhattanxe2x80x99s Inwood neighborhood. Jaquez said there was a street vendor who sold tacos a block from her Mexican restaurant.xe2x80x98I sell Mexican food and tacos. Thatxe2x80x99s what the Mexican street vendor was selling,xe2x80x99 she said. xe2x80x98Thatxe2x80x99s super direct competition. If I sell tacos for $4.50 and a street vendor a block away sells tacos for $2.50, the people are going to go the street vendor.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9dThis didnxe2x80x99t stop the media from proclaiming that Yang had imperiled his chances with New Yorkxe2x80x99s communities of color. xe2x80x9cThis [is] a great issue for Stringer: unites progressives behind him, allows him to make inroads into a very up-for-grabs Latino vote. Would think hexe2x80x99d ride this for a while,xe2x80x9d said David Freedlander of New York Magazine. xe2x80x9cAnd hexe2x80x99s standing here today with two state legislators, both the first Colombians elected to state office in NY. Both representing districts that are predominantly Latino and immigrant,xe2x80x9d replied Gloria Pazmino of NY1. Another New YorkMagazine writer concluded that the whole episode marked xe2x80x9can unforced error for the leading candidate for mayor.xe2x80x9d But did it?The lesson here isnxe2x80x99t that this movement of the multiracial ownership class is correct about the vending issue or any other. The point is that they exist. Andrew Yang wants their vote, and hexe2x80x99s asking them for it.From the beginning of his campaign, Yangxe2x80x99s strategy has been to identify the most high-salience, emotionally charged issue within a particular segment of the electorate and pledge to champion the most common opinion on it, whatever it may be. The result is a motley collection of policy stances and points of emphasis that would puzzle anyone trying to identify the underlying ideology. Police crackdowns on taco vendors (for Hispanic restaurateurs). Protecting the one-shot admissions exam to the cityxe2x80x99s specialized high schools (for Asian immigrant families). Hysterical opposition to the BDS movement (for the Hassidic Jews). No requirements for secular education in yeshivas (Hasidim again).What unites them all? Andrew Yangxe2x80x99s desire to be the mayor, thatxe2x80x99s what. Hexe2x80x99s betting he can stitch together a coalition of cross-ethnic reaction as a makeshift base, then let money and name recognition take care of the rest. And so far, itxe2x80x99s working. Not only has Yang led in every public survey, but in the latest and highest quality poll of the race to date with crosstabs, he led among every single racial group - Hispanics included. So much for the churro ladiesxe2x80x99 revenge.How should a left candidate respond to such a socially corrosive gambit? They could start by acknowledging that BID executives and chain restaurant kingpins arenxe2x80x99t the only constituencies that might find Yangxe2x80x99s rhetoric attractive. New York is filled with mom-and-pop grocers, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, standalone beauty shops and bakeries and bodegas, and licensed street vendors. They too are mostly low- and middle-income people of color. Many of them are immigrants. All of them have been crushed by the pandemic and nearly abandoned by the government. Telling them that theyxe2x80x99re xe2x80x9cguided by a white supremacist racist ideologyxe2x80x9d if theyxe2x80x99ve ever felt a pang of resentment toward vendors probably isnxe2x80x99t a great opener.How about this instead: when Yang says hexe2x80x99s the savior of small business, you could point out that one of his biggest donors is Long Deng, the former Finance Chair of the New York Republican Party and grocery mogul whose company did nearly $100 million in business in 2020. Or that Dengxe2x80x99s wife and sister, both executives at his company, also maxed out to Yang. Or that Yang received thousands from at least 31 other individuals employed by three different companies owned by the Deng family: iFresh, New York Mart, and Strong America Ltd. Or that Deng was a delegate for Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention and a major donor to his 2020 campaign. Whatever hexe2x80x99s cooking up with Yang, they probably donxe2x80x99t have your needs in mind.Or you could let the Timothy Chuangs of the world tell immigrant-run small businesses that their real problem is the unlicensed dumpling cart outside their restaurant, and then call them white supremacists if theyxe2x80x99ve ever wondered if he was right. Though realistically, thatxe2x80x99s probably the best way to convince them he is.Matthew Thomas is a writer and researcher in Queens, NY.

The opposite is true: the more aggressively and recklessly you spread CIA narratives or pro-war manipulation, the more rewarded you will be in that world. The classic case is Jeffrey Goldberg, who wrote one of the most deceitful and destructive articles of his generation: a lengthy New Yorker article in May, 2002 xe2x80x94 right as the propagandistic groundwork for the invasion of Iraq was being laid xe2x80x94 that claimed Saddam Hussein had formed an alliance with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.  In February, 2003, on the eve of the invasion of Iraq, NPR host Robert Siegel devoted a long segment to this claim. When he asked Goldberg about xe2x80x9ca man named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,xe2x80x9d Goldberg replied: xe2x80x9cHe is one of several men who might personify a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda.xe2x80x9dNeedless to say, nothing could generate hatred for someone among the American population xe2x80x94 just nine months away from the 9/11 attack xe2x80x94  more than associating them with bin Laden. Five months after Goldberg's New Yorker article, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force to impose regime change on Iraq; ten months later, the U.S. invaded Iraq; and by September, 2003, close to 70% of Americans believed the lie that Saddam had personally participated in the 9/11 attack.Goldberg's fabrication-driven article generated ample celebratory media attention and even prestigious journalism awards. It also led to great financial reward and career advancement. In 2007, The Atlantic's publisher David Bradley lured Goldberg away from The New Yorker by lavishing him with a huge signing bonus and even sent exotic horses to entertain Goldberg's children. Goldberg is now the editor-in-chief of that magazine and thus one of the most influential figures in media. In other words, the person who wrote what is arguably the most disastrous article of that decade was one most rewarded by the industry xe2x80x94 all because he served the aims of the U.S. security state and its war aims. That is how U.S. corporate journalism functions.Another illustrative mascot for this lucrative career path is NBC's national security correspondent Ken Dilanian. In 2014, his own former paper, The Los Angeles Times, acknowledged his \"collaborativexe2x80x9d relationship with the CIA. During his stint there, he mimicked false claims from John Brennan's CIA that no innocent people were killed from a 2012 Obama drone strike, only for human rights groups and leaked documents to prove many were. A FOIA request produced documents published by The Intercept in 2015 that showed Dilanian submitting his \"reportingxe2x80x9d to the CIA for approval in violation of The LA Timesxe2x80x99 own ethical guidelines and then repeating what he was told to say. But again, serving the CIA even with false \"reportingxe2x80x9d and unethical behavior is a career benefit in corporate media, not an impediment, and Dilanian rapidly fell upward after these embarrassing revelations. He first went to Associated Press and then to NBC News, where he broadcast numerous false Russiagate scams including purporting to xe2x80x9cindependently confirmxe2x80x9d CNN's ultimately retracted bombshell that Donald Trump, Jr. obtained advance access to the 2016 WikiLeaks archive.  On Monday, CNN made clear that this dynamic still drives the corporate media world. The network proudly announced that it had hired Natasha Bertrand away from Politico. In doing so, they added to their stable of former CIA operatives, NSA spies, Pentagon Generals and FBI agents a reporter who has done as much as anyone, if not more so, to advance the scripts of those agencies.Bertrand's career began taking off when, while at Business Insider, she abandoned her obsession with Russia's role in Syria in 2016 in order to monomaniacally fixate on every last conspiracy theory and gossip item that drove the Russiagate fraud during the 2016 campaign and then into the Trump presidency. Each month, Bertrand produced dozens of Russiagate articles for the site that were so unhinged that they made Rachel Maddow look sober, cautious and reliable. In 2018, it was Jeffrey Goldberg himself xe2x80x94 knowing a star CIA propagandist when he sees one xe2x80x94 who gave Bertrand her first big break by hiring her away from Business Insider to cover Russiagate for The Atlantic. Shortly thereafter, she joined the Queen of Russiagate conspiracies herself by becoming a national security analyst for MSNBC and NBC News. From there, it was onto Politico and now CNN: the ideal, rapid career climb that is the dream of every liberal security state servant calling themselves a journalist. Her final conspiratorial article for The Atlantic before moving to Politico is the perfect illustration of who and what she is:CNN's new national security star was no ordinary Russiagate fanatic. There was no conspiracy theory too unhinged or evidence-free for her to promote. As The Washington Post's media reporter Erik Wemple documented once the Steele Dossier was debunked, there was arguably nobody in media other than Rachel Maddow who promoted and ratified that hoax as aggressively, uncritically and persistently as Bertrand. She defended it even after the Mueller Report corroborated virtually none of its key claims. In a February, 2020 article headlined xe2x80x9cHow Politicoxe2x80x99s Natasha Bertrand bootstrapped dossier credulity into MSNBC gig,xe2x80x9d Wemple described how she was rewarded over and over for \"journalismxe2x80x9d that would be regarded in any healthy profession with nothing but scorn: Where therexe2x80x99s a report on Russian meddling, therexe2x80x99s an MSNBC segment waiting to be taped. Last Thursday night, MSNBC host Joy Reid xe2x80x94 subbing for xe2x80x9cAll Inxe2x80x9d host Chris Hayes xe2x80x94 turned to Politico national security reporter Natasha Bertrand with a question about whether Trump xe2x80x9cwantsxe2x80x9d Russian meddling or whether he canxe2x80x99t accept that \"foreign help is there.xe2x80x9c Bertrand responded: xe2x80x9cWe donxe2x80x99t have the reporting that suggests that the president has told aides, for example, that he really wants Russia to interfere because he thinks that itxe2x80x99s going to help him, right?xe2x80x9dNo, we donxe2x80x99t have that reporting xe2x80x94 though therexe2x80x99s no prohibition against fantasizing about it on national television. Such is the theme of Bertrandxe2x80x99s commentary during previous coverage of Russian interference, specifically the dossier of memos drawn up by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. With winks and nods from MSNBC hosts, Bertrand heaped credibility on the dossier xe2x80x94 which was published in full by BuzzFeed News in January 2017 xe2x80x94 in repeated television appearances.Wemple systematically reviewed the mountain of speculation, unproven conspiracies and outright falsehoods Bertrand shoveled to the public as she was repeatedly promoted. But it was the document that gave us deranged delusions about pee-pee tape blackmail and Michael Cohen's trip to Prague that was her crown jewel: xe2x80x9cThe Bertrand highlight reel features a great deal of thumb-on-scale speculation regarding the dossier,xe2x80x9d Wemple wrote.And when information started being declassified that proved much of Bertrand's claims about collusion to be a fraud, she complained that there was too much transparency, implying that the Trump administration was harming national security by allowing the public to know too much xe2x80x94 namely, allowing the public to see that her reporting was a fraud. A journalist who complains about too much transparency is like a cardiologist who complains that a patient has stopped smoking cigarettes, or like a journalist who voluntarily rats out her own source to the FBI or who agitates for censorship of political speech: a walking negation of the professional values they are supposed to uphold. But that is Natasha Bertrand, and, to the extent that there are some people who still believe that working at CNN is desirable, she was just rewarded for it again yesterday xe2x80x94 just as journalists who rat out their own sources to the FBI and advocate for internet censorship are now celebrated in today's rotted media climate.Bertrand's trail of journalistic scandals and recklessness extend well beyond her Russiagate conspiracies. Last October, she published an article in Politico strongly implying that Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe was speaking without authorization or any evidence when he said Iran was attempting to undermine President Trump's 2020 presidential campaign. But last month,  the Biden administration declassified an intelligence report which said they had \"high confidencexe2x80x9d that Iran had done exactly what Ratcliffe alleged: namely, run an influence campaign to hurt Trump's candidacy. A former national security official, Cliff Sims, said upon hearing of CNN's hiring that he explicitly warned Bertrand's editors that the story was false but they chose to publish it anyway.It was also Bertrand who most effectively laundered the extremely significant CIA lie in October, 2020 that the documents obtained by The New York Post about the Biden family's business dealings in China and Ukraine were \"Russian disinformation.xe2x80x9d Even though the John-Brennan-led former intelligence officials admitted from the start that they had no evidence for this claim, Bertrand not only amplified it but vouched for its credibility by writing that the Post's reporting xe2x80x9chas drawn comparisons to 2016, when Russian hackers dumped troves of emails from Democrats onto the internet xe2x80x94 producing few damaging revelations but fueling accusations of corruption by Trumpxe2x80x9d (that those 2016 DNC and Podesta documents produced xe2x80x9cfew damaging revelationsxe2x80x9d would come as a big surprise to the five DNC operatives, led by Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who were forced to resign when their pro-Hillary cheating was revealed). It was this Politico article by Bertrand that was then used by Facebook and Twitter to justify their joint censorship of the Post's reporting in the weeks before the 2020 election, and numerous media outlets xe2x80x94 including The Intercept xe2x80x94 gullibly told their readers to ignore the revelations on the ground that these authentic documents were \"Russian disinformation.xe2x80x9d Yet once it did its job of helping defeat Trump, that claim was debunked when even the intelligence community acknowledged it had no evidence of Russian involvement in the appearance of these materials, and Hunter Biden himself admitted he was the subject of a federal investigation for the transactions revealed by those documents. But even when her fantasies and conspiracies are debunked, Bertrand xe2x80x94 like a good intelligence soldier xe2x80x94 never cedes any ground in her propaganda campaigns. She was, needless to say, one of the journalists who most vocally promoted the CIA's story xe2x80x94 published as Trump was announcing his plans to withdraw from Afghanistan xe2x80x94 that Russia had paid bounties to the Taliban for the death of U.S. soldiers. Yet even when the U.S. intelligence community under Joe Biden admitted last week that it has only \"low to moderatexe2x80x9d confidence that this even happened xe2x80x94 with the NSA and other surveillance agencies saying they could find no evidence to corroborate the CIA's story xe2x80x94 she continued to insist that nothing had changed with the story, denying last week on a Mediaite podcast that anything had happened to cast doubt on the original story: xe2x80x9cI think itxe2x80x99s much more nuanced than it being a walk-back. I donxe2x80x99t think thatxe2x80x99s right actually.\"Even a cursory review of Bertrand's prolific output reveals an endless array of gossip, conspiracy and speculative assertions masquerading as journalism. The commentator Luke Thomas detailed many of these transgressions on Monday and correctly observed that xe2x80x9carguably no single reporter has contributed more to the deranged and paranoid national security fantasies of the center-left than Natasha Bertrand. She's an embarrassment to her profession and will, therefore, fit right in at CNN.xe2x80x9d As Thomas noted, beyond all of Bertrand's well-documented and consequential propaganda, xe2x80x9cshe sees conspiracies and perfidiousness around every corner,xe2x80x9d pointing to this demented yet highly viral tweet that deciphered comments from former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) as inadvertently revealing some secret scheme to expand Trump's pardon powers. That scheme, like most of her speculative predictions, never materialized.Then there is her garden-variety ethical scandal. In January, freelancer Dean Sterling Jones accused Bertrand of stealing his work without credit or payment. In a post he published, Jones documented how he emailed Bertrand a draft with reporting he had been working on, and in response she agreed to report it jointly with him on a co-byline. Yet two weeks later, the article appeared in The Atlantic with Bertrand as the only named reporter. Only after Jones complained did they insert a sentence into the story begrudgingly citing him as a source. xe2x80x9cBy my count,xe2x80x9d Jones wrote, xe2x80x9cBertrandxe2x80x99s article contains at least six unequivocal examples of direct copying and revisions of my work.xe2x80x9d When he published his post detailing his accusations, Bertrand arrogantly refused even to provide comment to the freelancer whose work she pilfered.Natasha Bertrand has spent the last five years working as a spokesperson for the alliance composed of the CIA and the Democratic Party, spreading every unvetted and unproven conspiracy theory about Russiagate that they fed her. The more loyally she performed that propagandistic function, the more rapidly she was promoted and rewarded. Now she arrives at her latest destination: CNN, not only Russiagate Central along with MSNBC but also the home to countless ex-operatives of the security state agencies on whose behalf Bertrand speaks. Once again we see the two key truths of modern corporate journalism in the U.S. First, we have the Jeffrey Goldberg Principle: you can never go wrong, but only right, by disseminating lies and propaganda from the CIA. Second, the organs that spread the most disinformation and crave disinformation agents as their employees are the very same ones who demand censorship of the internet in the name of stopping disinformation. I've long said that if you want to understand how to thrive in this part of the media world, you should study the career advancement of Jeffrey Goldberg, propelled by one reckless act after the next. But now the sequel to the Goldberg Rise is the thriving career of this new CNN reporter whose value as a CIA propagandist Goldberg, notably, was the first to spot and reward.Update, Apr. 27, 2021, 4:32 pm ET: Just as several readers predicted would happen, other corporate journalists responded to this article by engaging in a rank-closing defense of Bertrand, principally by accusing me of misogyny for publishing this critique of her reporting. Unlike me, they evidently view adult professional woman in highly influential media roles (such as Bertrand) as too fragile to endure critiques of their journalism, unlike adult men, who they apparently believe are strong enough to handle criticisms: a regressive view of the sexes right out of the 1950s. They also apparently skipped over the entire first section of this article detailing how Jeffrey Goldberg and Ken Dilanian xe2x80x94 both men xe2x80x94 were the pioneers of the CIA-serving career trajectory Bertrand is now following. But the oddest aspect of this media reaction, the only one that makes it worth noting here, is that misogyny allegations against me for this article were led by GQ's own Russiagate fanatic Julia Ioffe, even though Ioffe herself, in 2019, publicly accused Bertrand of a rather serious ethical violation that probably should be added to the list:For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Be careful, Glenn. Soon they'll be calling you a misogynist.Let's be clear, we aren't talking about journalists.   That's not the line of work.This is counter-intelligence. As William Casey allegedly said: \"Wexe2x80x99ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.\"Operation Mockingbird was discovered and documented by Congress' Church Committee in 1975; that program placed CIA operatives in high positions throughout mainstream media.NOTHING was done to ensure this did not continue.Treating CNN or NPR or FOX or any of that as \"news\" or \"journalism\" is like calling our actions in Vietnam or Iraq or West Africa during the slave trade \"humanitarian.\"  It is a pretense that should be abandoned. Our narrative is being constructed; our enemies labeled; our heroes fabricated; our consent manufactured.   Glenn and others have documented this ad nauseum for years.   This is not, as people often claim, corporations making shit up because \"it sells.\"   It doesn't.   The \"news\" part of these media empires is spittle in a bucket of profits; its value is in its ability to shape the world for the other, more profitable ventures.   Our mainstream media empire is an intelligence asset.   Full stop.   And \"reporters\" like Natasha Bertrand and Rachel Maddow are either direct employees or themselves assets.   They aren't arrogant.   They aren't bad journalists.   They aren't lazy or unprofessional.   They do a job and they do it reasonably well.   It's just a different job than most Americans believe.

Today, we are initiating this new section of our Substack, entitled \"Outside Voices.\" The first article is from Leighton Woodhouse, reporting on the exploitation of anti-free-speech laws to target various activists as \"domestic extremists\" or \"domestic terrorists\" on both the right and left, with a focus on how this repressive model is being weaponized against animal rights activists (one of the groups, along with anti-government and right-wing organization, classified as \"domestic threats\" by last month's Homeland Security Report which I reported). We have other freelance articles in the pipeline and expect to publish them regularly. We are looking for articles that relate to the topics I report on and cover but which are not necessarily duplicative of what I already do. I'm excited to experiment with this program, including, for instance, publishing writers who disagree with one another on a particular topic and letting them debate. The podcast I had been doing with Ben Mora, \"After Hours,\" was put on temporary hiatus due to Ben's conflicting commitments, and we have decided for the same reason to permanently cease production (anyone who purchased a year subscription specifically on that podcast page can contact us for a pro-rated refund if you wish). I'm excited about this new freelance program because it will enable us to expand the topics we cover here and provide a platform to young journalists seeking to report, analyze and comment with full independence and freedom to dissent from prevailing corporate media orthodoxies. As you know, we count exclusively on and are grateful for reader support for everything we do here. The more support we receive, the more we will be able to expand our journalism in general and specifically provide a platform for a wide range of new voices to earn a living doing independent journalism.  Give a gift subscriptionBy Leighton WoodhouseLast May, several months into a global pandemic that had capsized the economy, hog farmers had a problem on their hands. With restaurants closed, demand for their product had evaporated. With outbreaks shuttering meat processing plants all over the country, they had nowhere to send their animals to be slaughtered. If kept alive, the pigs would quickly outgrow facilities designed to hold them only for highly abbreviated lives, and the costs of feeding and watering them would become astronomical.So some major pork producers, among them Iowaxe2x80x99s largest, Iowa Select Farms, made a horrifying decision. They would mass exterminate their animals in one fell swoop, using a technique that promised efficiency for themselves but guaranteed incomprehensible suffering for the pigs.The method was called xe2x80x9cventilation shutdown,xe2x80x9d and it entailed, basically, roasting the pigs alive. Workers would close all of the vents into the barns, shut down the air conditioning, and pipe steam into the buildings until the animals died by asphyxiation or hyperthermia, a process that took several hours. Then a worker would walk through the piles of corpses with a captive bolt gun, shooting whatever stragglers had survived.The company, however, was unaware that there was a whistleblower within their ranks. An ISF truck driver named Lucas Walker, who had long been appalled by the companyxe2x80x99s treatment of its pigs, had informed an activist named Matt Johnson of the companyxe2x80x99s plans. Johnson snuck into the barns, placed hidden cameras, and recorded video and audio of the massacre to later release to the news media.Neither Johnson nor Walker is what most people of conscience would consider a dangerous political extremist. They had no desire to bring any physical harm to anyone; on the contrary, they were moved by the cause of putting a halt to needless suffering. But both a new state law in Iowa and a bill currently being considered in Congress could render them such in the eyes of the criminal justice system. It is just one example of the moral hazard posed by the ongoing effort in Congress and within the Biden administration to erect a new domestic security state apparatus in response to the Trump years and the Capitol Riot xe2x80x94 an effort the CIA has joined, while animal rights groups and environmental campaigners have been explicitly listed among its targets.In 2011, Iowa Select Farms had been the subject of an undercover investigation by the animal rights group Mercy For Animals. Liz Pachaud, an animal rights activist with MFA, had taken a job at the farm and, over the course of four months, documented appalling conditions there with an undercover camera. When the gruesome footage was released, it caused a major crisis for ISF, with numerous grocery chains dropping the company as a supplier.The following year, the animal agriculture industry successfully lobbied the Iowa state legislature to make what Pachaud had done a crime. The law was one of many so-called xe2x80x9cAg Gagxe2x80x9d laws in agricultural states across the country, which make undercover investigations on factory farms by animal rights groups unlawful (an estimated 99 percent of animals raised for meat are factory farmed; the very few small family farms that are left are being systematically driven out of business by the industrialization and economic consolidation of the industry). As Ag gag laws effectively criminalize speech, some of the more sloppily written among them have been subject to successful constitutional challenges; Iowaxe2x80x99s 2012 law was among them. In 2019, a federal judge struck down Iowaxe2x80x99s 2012 law.That same month, a new Governor took office in Iowa. Kim Reynolds had won her office in 2018 with the conspicuous help of Iowa Select Farms. ISFxe2x80x99s co-owners, Jeff and Deborah Hansen, have donated nearly $300,000 to Governor Reynolds. During the 2018 race, Deborah was the Governorxe2x80x99s biggest individual campaign contributor. Kim Reynolds had been the guest of honor at the Hansensxe2x80x99 family foundation.Governor Reynolds had barely been in office a month before a newly re-written Ag Gag bill was introduced into the legislature. By summer, she had signed it into law.Now, Johnson has become the first person to be charged under the 2019 Ag Gag law for attempting to enter one ISF facility. He is facing a separate wiretap charge for the hidden cameras in the barn where the company carried out its ventilation shutdown. In the meantime, yet another Ag Gag law has passed through the Iowa legislature, which increases penalties for the crime of planting hidden cameras in animal agriculture facilities. Governor Reynolds is expected to sign the new bill into law any day now.As should surprise nobody who lived through the political aftermath of 9/11, these laws were passed under the pretext of combatting xe2x80x9cterrorism.xe2x80x9d Radical animal rights and environmental activists have, in fact, long been among the FBIxe2x80x99s top xe2x80x9cdomestic terrorismxe2x80x9d targets, as well as targets of draconian new legislation. In 2006, at the behest of the pharmaceutical and animal agriculture industries, Congress passed a law specifically defining animal rights activism aimed at xe2x80x9cdamaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprisexe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 whether or not violence was involved xe2x80x94 as xe2x80x9cterrorism.xe2x80x9d Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), the group Johnson belongs to (I used to cover DxE as a reporter and have since become a member myself), was the subject of a major FBI investigation over the xe2x80x9ctheftxe2x80x9d of two dying piglets from a factory farm. After he was discovered, the FBI interviewed Walker, asking him if DxE sells drugs or guns to finance their activism, and tried to recruit him as an informant into their activities.ShareThis dismal history should be an obvious cautionary tale about the hazards of enhancing the statexe2x80x99s power to surveil and prosecute people for politically motivated activity, beyond the ample criminal laws already on the books. But in the wake of the January 6 MAGA Capitol Riot, progressives, in particular, have gained an appetite for more.Currently, a bill with 196 Democratic co-sponsors (and 3 Republicans) is before Congress, which would begin to build the legal and bureaucratic architecture for an interagency domestic terrorism response unit within the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. The legislation is explicitly a response to the Capitol Riot and is pointed particularly at xe2x80x9cWhite supremacistxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cneo-Nazixe2x80x9d groups xe2x80x94 a particularly unsympathetic and uncontroversial cast of culprits.But the PATRIOT Act was also purported to target only the most hateful, murderous people in the world xe2x80x94 Islamic terrorists xe2x80x94 before it metastasized into a massive surveillance state infrastructure that spied on literally every single American with an internet connection. Are we to expect that a domestic analogue to the PATRIOT Act will draw the line at violent sociopathic racists? The intelligence community demonstrably does not: a recently declassified report lists animal rights and environmental activists, abortion activists on both the pro-life and the pro-choice sides, anarchists, and anti-capitalists as potential domestic terrorist threats.If wexe2x80x99ve learned anything from the last few years, itxe2x80x99s that corporations are all too eager to co-opt the progressive rhetoric du jour, whether to sell sneakers or to protect themselves against workplace discrimination lawsuits. And the FBI has been more than willing to investigate activists engaged in non-violent activities as terrorists under the 2006 Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. A new domestic federal law enforcement bureaucracy dedicated to surveilling and investigating anyone the government claims to suspect is a xe2x80x9cterroristxe2x80x9d would be a bonanza to industries facing concerted activist pressure, whether animal agriculture or fossil fuels, or a company in any industry facing a unionization drive. What possible reason is there to believe that corporations wonxe2x80x99t lobby the Biden administration and future administrations to use their new powers to ensnare activists who campaign against them, all in the name of ridding the country of violent political extremists and xe2x80x9cinsurrectionistsxe2x80x9d?The answer is that there is no reason to believe it, and every reason to believe the hunt for xe2x80x9cdomestic terroristsxe2x80x9d could eventually be turned against anyone with the will and the means to effectively confront those who hold concentrated political and corporate power xe2x80x94 including through strictly non-violent means. A demonstrated willingness to use violence has never been a requisite for law enforcement agencies to brand those they wish to malign as xe2x80x9cterroristsxe2x80x9d, as DxE activists know all too well. All thatxe2x80x99s required is their willingness to use the label.After 9/11, passage of the PATRIOT Act was enabled by the bullying of dissidents in a climate of enforced jingoism. It was dangerous to ask critical questions then; safety was found only in conformity. Wexe2x80x99re in such a moment again, but this time from within a liberal rather than a right-wing consensus. But the outcome will be the same: the hardening of state power, made possible through organized collective hysteria.Subscribe nowFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Will read it, but for the whole project Glenn's description \"not necessarily duplicative\" is not exactly mouth watering.

Two weeks after the Floyd killing, The New York Times said that the xe2x80x9cmoney has come in so fast and so unexpectedly that some groups even began to turn away and redirect donors elsewhere,xe2x80x9d while xe2x80x9cothers said they still could not yet account for how much had arrived.xe2x80x9d Propelled by the emotions and nationwide protest movements that emerged last summer, corporations, oligarchs, celebrities and the general public  opened their wallets and began pouring money into BLM coffers and have not stopped doing so.Where that money has gone has been the topic of numerous media investigations as well as concerns expressed by racial justice advocates. AP noted that BLM's sharing of financial data in February xe2x80x9cmarks the first time in the movementxe2x80x99s nearly eight-year history that BLM leaders have revealed a detailed look at their finances.xe2x80x9d That newfound transparency was prompted by what AP called xe2x80x9clongstanding tensions boil[ing] over between some of the movementxe2x80x99s grassroots organizers and national leaders xe2x80x94 the former went public last fall with grievances about financial transparency, decision-making and accountability.\" In December, ten local BLM chapters severed ties with the national group amidst questions and suspicions over the handling of activities and finances by one of its co-founders, Patrisse Cullors, who had assumed the title of Executive Director. On April 10, The New York Post published an exposxc3xa9 on what it called Cullorsxe2x80x99 xe2x80x9cmillion-dollar real estate buying binge.xe2x80x9d The paper noted that as protests were unfolding around the country, the BLM official was xe2x80x9csnagging four high-end homes for $3.2 million in the US alone, according to property records,xe2x80x9d including a California property valued at $1.4 million. The article also revealed that the self-described Marxist and her partner xe2x80x9cwere spotted in the Bahamas looking for a unit at the Albany,xe2x80x9d an xe2x80x9celite enclave laid out on 600 oceanside acres,xe2x80x9d which xe2x80x9cfeatures a private marina and designer golf course.xe2x80x9d The Post included photos of several of the properties obtained from public real estate listings. In an interview about that Post story with Marc Lamont Hill, Cullors xe2x80x94 except saying she has not visited the Bahamas since the age of 15 xe2x80x94 did not deny the accuracy of the reporting, but instead justified her real estate acquisitions. She denied she had taken a salary from the BLM group, pointing to other income she earns as a professor, author, and a YouTube content creator as the source of this sudden outburst of real estate purchases. She denounced the Post reporting as \"frankly racist, and sexist.xe2x80x9dSo that seems like a perfectly healthy cycle for covering a controversy, obviously in the public interest. In the wake of concerns from activists about where this massive amount of BLM money has gone, The New York Post did its job of unearthing the splurge of real estate acquisitions by the person who controls and directs BLM's budget and who has been a target of accusations and suspicions from activists. Cullors then had the opportunity to publicly provide her side of the story concerning her aggressive and ample financial investments.But then something quite unhealthy and unusual occurred. Five days after publication of that Post article, the Substack journalists Shant Mesrobian and Zaid Jilani reported that Facebook was banning the sharing of that article worldwide on its platform xe2x80x94 similar to what Twitter and Facebook did in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election to The New York Post's reporting on the Biden family's business dealings in China and Ukraine. The Substack reporters noted that Facebook ultimately confirmed the worldwide ban of the Post's reporting to The New York Timesxe2x80x99 media reporter Ben Smith, justifying it on the ground that the article xe2x80x9crevealed personal details about [Cullors] and her residence in violation of Facebookxe2x80x99s community standards.xe2x80x9d In his weekly New York Times Sunday night media column, Smith returned to this subject. When a Facebook lawyer justified the censorship by citing an alleged policy that the tech monopoly will ban any xe2x80x9carticle [which] shows your home or apartment, says what city youxe2x80x99re in and you donxe2x80x99t like it,xe2x80x9d Smith expressed extreme skepticism:The policy sounds crazy because it could apply to dozens, if not hundreds, of news articles every day xe2x80x94 indeed, to a staple of reporting for generations that has included Michael Bloombergxe2x80x99s expansion of his townhouse in 2009 and the comings and goings of the Hamptons elites. Alex Rodriguez doesnxe2x80x99t like a story that includes a photo of him and his former fiancxc3xa9e, Jennifer Lopez, smiling in front of his house? Delete it. Donald Trump is annoyed about a story that includes a photo of him outside his suite at Mar-a-Lago? Gone. Facebookxe2x80x99s hands, the lawyer told me, are tied by its own policies.Presumably, the only reason this doesnxe2x80x99t happen constantly is because nobody knows about the policy. But now you do! Smith was additionally disturbed that Facebook was, in essence, overriding the editorial judgment of news outlets, which grapple every day with how to strike the balance between ensuring the public knows of information in the public interest and protecting a person's right to privacy. For obvious reasons, public figures and organizations xe2x80x94 which both BLM and Cullors undoubtedly are xe2x80x94 are deemed to have a lower expectation of privacy when it comes to what is newsworthy. That is why, for example, the extramarital affairs of Donald Trump or Bill Clinton are deemed newsworthy whereas, outside of the dead-but-returning Gawker sewer, the sex lives of private citizens are not. Yet Facebook accords no deference to the editorial judgments even of the most established media outlets. Instead, they told Smith, xe2x80x9cFacebook alone decides.xe2x80x9dWhatever onexe2x80x99s views are on this particular censorship controversy, there is no doubt that it is part of the highly consequential debate over online free speech and the ability of monopolies like Facebook to control the dissemination of news and the boundaries of political discourse and debate. That is why Smith devoted his weekly column to it. And yet, when Smith approached the standard free speech advocacy groups for comment on this story, virtually none was willing to speak up. xe2x80x9cFacebookxe2x80x99s usual critics have been strikingly silent as the company has extended its purview over speech into day-to-day editorial calls,xe2x80x9d he wrote.Among those groups which insisted that it would not comment on Facebook's censorship of the Post's BLM story was the vaunted, brave and deeply principled free speech organization, the American Civil Liberties Union. xe2x80x9cWe donxe2x80x99t have anyone who is closely plugged into that situation right now so we donxe2x80x99t have anything to say at this point in time,xe2x80x9d emailed Aaron Madrid Aksoz, an ACLU spokesman. Smith said xe2x80x9cthe only criticism he could obtain came from the News Media Alliance, the old newspaper lobby, whose chief executive, David Chavern, called blocking The Postxe2x80x99s link xe2x80x98completely arbitraryxe2x80x99 and noted that xe2x80x98Facebook and Google stand between publishers and their audiences and determine how and whether news content is seen.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9dHow is it possible that the ACLU is all but invisible on one of the central free speech debates of our time: namely, how much censorship should Silicon Valley tech monopolists be imposing on our political speech? As someone who intensively reports on these controversies, I can barely remember any time when the ACLU spoke up loudly on any of these censorship debates, let alone assumed the central role that any civil liberties group with any integrity would, by definition, assume on this growing controversy. In lieu of the traditional, iconic and organization-defining willingness xe2x80x94 eagerness xe2x80x94 of the ACLU to defend free speech precisely when it has been most controversial and upsetting to liberals, what we now get instead are cowardly, P.R.-consultant-scripted excuses for staying as far away as possible: xe2x80x9cWe donxe2x80x99t have anyone who is closely plugged into that situation right now so we donxe2x80x99t have anything to say at this point in time.xe2x80x9d That sounds like something Marco Rubio's office says when asked about a Trump tweet or that a corporate headquarters would say to avoid an inflammatory controversy, not the reaction of a stalwart civil liberties group to a publicly debated act of political censorship.In this particular case, it is not difficult to understand the cause of the ACLU's silence. They obviously cannot defend Facebook's censorship xe2x80x94 affirmatively defending the stifling of political speech is, at least for now, still a bridge too far for the group xe2x80x94 but they are petrified of saying anything that might seem even remotely critical of, let alone adversarial to, BLM activists and organizations. That is because BLM is one of the most cherished left-liberal causes, and the ACLU now relies almost entirely on donations and grants from those who have standard left-liberal politics and want and expect the ACLU to advance that ideological and partisan agenda above its nonpartisan civil liberties principles. Criticizing BLM is a third rail in left-liberal political circles, which is where the ACLU now resides almost entirely, and thus it again cowers in silence as another online act of censorship which advances political liberalism emerges. Indeed, BLM is an organization which the ACLU frequently champions:January 4th 2021Like so many liberal-left media outlets and advocacy groups, the ACLU was suffering financially before they were saved and then enriched beyond their wildest dreams by Donald Trump and the #Resistance movement he spawned. xe2x80x9cThe American Civil Liberties Union this week laid off 23 employees, about 7 percent of the organizationxe2x80x99s national staff,xe2x80x9d announced The Washington Post in April, 2015. But in the Trump era, the money flowed in almost as quickly and furiously as post-Floyd money to BLM. In February, 2017, said AP, the group xe2x80x9cis suddenly awash in donations and new members as it does battle with President Donald Trump over the extent of his constitutional authority, with nearly $80 million in online contributions alone pouring in since the election.xe2x80x9d So that is the donor base it now serves.The ACLU's we-know-nothing routine for abstaining from commenting on Facebook's censorship of the BLM article is, for so many reasons, preposterous. The group funds what it calls its Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, and some of its best lawyers oversee it. Clearly they focus on these issues. And the ACLU in general has taken a firm and borderline-absolutist position against online censorship by Silicon Valley monopolies: principles whose application to this particular case would be easy and obvious. The ACLU has a section of its website devoted to xe2x80x9cInternet Speech,xe2x80x9d and its position on such matters is stated explicitly:The ACLU believes in an uncensored Internet, a vast free-speech zone deserving at least as much First Amendment protection as that afforded to traditional media such as books, newspapers, and magazinesxe2x80xa6.The ACLU has been at the forefront of protecting online freedom of expression in its myriad forms. We brought the first case in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared speech on the Internet equally worthy of the First Amendmentxe2x80x99s historical protections.In a July, 2018 article published on the group's site entitled xe2x80x9cFacebook Shouldn't Censor Offensive Speech,xe2x80x9d the group praised Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's controversial pledge xe2x80x9cto keep Facebook from diving deeper into the business of censorshipxe2x80x9d as xe2x80x9cthe right call.xe2x80x9d Unlike in response to the BLM controversy, the ACLU had no trouble back then recognizing that xe2x80x9cwhat's at stake here is the ability of one platform that serves as a forum for the speech of billions of people to use its enormous power to censor speech on the basis of its own determinations of what is true, what is hateful, and what is offensive.xe2x80x9d The ACLU's stated policy on these controversies could not have been clearer: xe2x80x9cgiven Facebookxe2x80x99s nearly unparalleled status as a forum for political speech and debate, it should not take down anything but unlawful speech, like incitement to violence.xe2x80x9d In light of that principle, how is it remotely hard to denounce Facebook's censorship of the Post's article given that it does not even arguably fall within the scope of those narrow exceptions? Because the ACLU still employs a few old-school civil libertarians among its hundreds of lawyers and staff, those employees manage to do work and express views that are consistent with the ACLU's old-school civil liberties agenda even when contrary to the interests of liberal politics. But the tactics used by the ACLU in those cases to downplay or hide those aberrations are as transparent as they are craven. When three Silicon Valley monopolies united to remove the social media app Parler from the internet in January, 2021 after influential Democratic lawmakers demanded it xe2x80x94 one of the most brute acts of monopolistic censorship yet xe2x80x94 an ACLU lawyer, Ben Wizner, was cited in The New York Times as labelling Parler's destruction xe2x80x9ctroubling,xe2x80x9d telling the paper: xe2x80x9cI think we should recognize the importance of neutrality when wexe2x80x99re talking about the infrastructure of the internet.xe2x80x9d But on the ACLU's highly active and influential Twitter account xe2x80x94 the group's primary platform for promoting its work, expressing its views, and soliciting donations, where it has two million followers and often tweets up to fifty times a day xe2x80x94 the group said absolutely nothing about the removal of an entire social media app from the internet:Indeed, the ACLU xe2x80x94 outside of a few token, hidden statements xe2x80x94 has chosen to play at most a minor role in the key free speech controversies of the day, ones focusing on such weighty matters as internet freedom and online censorship over our political debates by Silicon Valley monopolies. Over the last four years, as Facebook's censorship has expanded rapidly, the ACLU has said little to nothing about it xe2x80x94 including remaining in utter silence about the extraordinary decision to censor pre-election reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop and what it revealed about Joe Biden's business dealings. Last month, Substack reporter Michael Tracey reviewed the ACLU's prior 100 tweets and found that 63 of them were about trans issues while a grand total of one was about free speech and none about due process. A comparison of the number of ACLU statements on online censorship controversies to its manifestations on trans issues similarly reveals a fixation on the latter with very little interest in the former:It goes without saying that the ACLU has every right to devote a huge bulk of its institutional resources and public advocacy to the cause of trans equality if it chooses to do so. But what that reveals is that the group is becoming exactly what its leaders always vowed it would never be: just another garden-variety liberal political advocacy group. After all, there is no shortage of extremely well-financed LGBT groups doing the same advocacy on trans issues. Those LGBT groups shifted their focus almost entirely to trans issues when they won the entire agenda of gay and lesbian equality with the Supreme Court's 2015 legalization of same-sex marriage in all fifty states, and supporting trans rights is the mainstream, standard view of Democratic Party leaders and liberal activists. The ACLU's refusal to engage with growing online censorship is baffling even from the perspective of its liberal politics given that radical leftists are increasingly (and predictably) the targets of tech censorship alongside anti-establishment right-wing voices. Just yesterday, the highly popular trans YouTube host Natalie Wynn of Contrapoints complained that one of her past episodes had just been demonetized and urged: xe2x80x9cFree speech should be reclaimed as an essential leftist issue. We should not surrender the most fundamental civil right to Google LLC in the name of deplatforming rightists and curtailing harassment.xe2x80x9d Wynn's last video, rebutting the views of J.K. Rowling on trans issues, featured Wynn's list of the telltale signs of xe2x80x9cindirect bigotryxe2x80x9d toward trans people, and she included \"free speech advocacy,xe2x80x9d but xe2x80x94 as happens to so many people xe2x80x94 Wynn has apparently reconsidered that view and has discovered the centrality of free speech values now that her own speech is targeted. But agitating for more online political censorship still remains a cause deeply popular among establishment liberals, further explaining the ACLU's reluctance to involve itself in these controversies on the side of free expression.What always distinguished the ACLU in the past xe2x80x94 and what gave it credibility with judges in courtrooms xe2x80x94 was its devotion to and focus on non-partisan free speech, free press and due process causes that were too unpopular or controversial for other groups to touch, particularly liberal groups who could not afford to offend the political sensibilities of Democrats. There are still some isolated occasions when the ACLU does such things xe2x80x94 such as when it spoke up in defense of the NRA against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's efforts to target the group with destruction or when the ACLU recently denounced parts of the Democratsxe2x80x99 H.R.1 xe2x80x9creformsxe2x80x9dxe2x80x94 but the ACLU largely hides those exceptions on its most popular public platforms, and they are becoming increasingly rare.And now we have arrived at the truly depressing and tawdry place where the ACLU is afraid to apply its long-stated principles to denounce Facebook's censorship because the censorship in question happened to be an article that reflected poorly on the sacred-among-liberals BLM group. In the place of brave lawyers and activists defending the constitutional rights and civil liberties even of those people and groups most despised, we have instead a corporate spokesman emailing The New York Times with excuses about why it cannot and will not speak up about a major censorship controversy that has been brewing for two weeks.

That is because he is the only one they could claim was killed by pro-Trump protesters at the January 6 riot at the Capitol. So The New York Times on January 8 published an emotionally gut-wrenching but complete fiction that never had any evidence xe2x80x94 that Officer Sicknick's skull was savagely bashed in with a fire extinguisher by a pro-Trump mob until he died xe2x80x94 and, just like the now-discredited Russian bounty story also unveiled by that same paper, cable outlets and other media platforms repeated this lie over and over in the most emotionally manipulative way possible. Just watch a part of what they did and how:As I detailed over and over when examining this story, there were so many reasons to doubt this storyline from the start. Nobody on the record claimed it happened. The autopsy found no blunt trauma to the head. Sicknick's own family kept urging the press to stop spreading this story because he called them the night of January 6 and told them he was fine xe2x80x94 obviously inconsistent with the media's claim that he died by having his skull bashed in xe2x80x94 and his own mother kept saying that she believed he died of a stroke.But the gruesome story of Sicknick's xe2x80x9cmurderxe2x80x9d was too valuable to allow any questioning. It was weaponized over and over to depict the pro-Trump mob not as just violent but barbaric and murderous, because if Sicknick weren't murdered by them, then nobody was (without Sicknick, the only ones killed were four pro-Trump supporters: two who died of a heart attack, one from an amphetamine overdose, and the other, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot point blank in the neck by Capitol Police despite being unarmed). So crucial was this fairy tale about Sicknick that it made its way into the official record of President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate, and they had Joe Biden himself recite from the script, even as clear facts mounted proving it was untrue.Because of its centrality to the media narrative and agenda, anyone who tried to point out the serious factual deficiencies in this story xe2x80x94 in other words, people trying to be journalists xe2x80x94 were smeared by Democratic Party loyalists who pretend to be journalists as \"Sicknick Truthers,xe2x80x9d white nationalist sympathizers, and supporters of insurrection.For the crime of trying to determine the factual truth of what happened, my character was constantly impugned by these propagandistic worms, as was anyone else's who tried to tell the truth about Sicknick's tragic death. Because one of the first people to highlight the journalistic truth here was former Trump official Darren Beattie of Revolver News and one of the few people on television willing to host doubts about the official story was Tucker Carlson, any doubts about the false Sicknick story xe2x80x94 no matter how well-grounded in truth, facts, reason and evidence xe2x80x94 were cast as fascism and white supremacy, and those raising questions smeared as \"truthersxe2x80x9d: the usual dreary liberal insults for trying to coerce people into submitting to their lies:Because the truth usually prevails, at least ultimately, their lies, yet again, all came crashing down on their heads on Monday. The District of Columbiaxe2x80x99s chief medical examiner earlier this morning issued his official ruling in the Sicknick case, and it was so definitive that The Washington Post xe2x80x94 one of the media outlets that had pushed the multiple falsehoods xe2x80x94 did not even bother to try to mask or mitigate the stark conclusion it revealed:The first line tells much of the story: xe2x80x9cCapitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick suffered two strokes and died of natural causes a day after he confronted rioters at the Jan. 6 insurrection, the Districtxe2x80x99s chief medical examiner has ruled.xe2x80x9d Using understatement, the paper added: xe2x80x9cThe ruling, released Monday, likely will make it difficult for prosecutors to pursue homicide charges in the officerxe2x80x99s death.xe2x80x9dThis definitive finding from the medical examiner not only rids us of the Fire Extinguisher lie but also the second theory to which these media outlets resorted once they had to face the reality that they spent weeks spreading an outright lie (needless to say, they provided no real accountability or even acknowledgement for the fact that they did spread that Fire Extinguisher tale, instead just seamlessly moving to their next evidence-free claim). They changed their story to claim that pro-Trump protesters still murdered Sicknick, not with a fire extinguisher but with bear spray, which video shows at least one protester using in his vicinity.The problem with that theory is that bear spray is not usually fatal, and the medical examiner's findings ruled out the possibility that this is what caused his death:In an interview with The Washington Post, Francisco J. Diaz, the medical examiner, said the autopsy found no evidence the 42-year-old officer suffered an allergic reaction to chemical irritants, which Diaz said would have caused Sicknickxe2x80x99s throat to quickly seize. Diaz also said there was no evidence of internal or external injuriesxe2x80xa6.Diaz said Sicknick suffered two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by a clot in an artery that supplies blood to that area of the body. Diaz said he could not comment on whether Sicknick had a preexisting medical condition, citing privacy laws.So there goes that second fairy tale. The Post did note the medical examiner's observation regarding Sicknick's participation in defending the Capitol that day that xe2x80x9call that transpired played a role in his condition.xe2x80x9d That of course is true: just as it is true for the two pro-Trump supporters who had heart attacks that day and the other pro-Trump supporter who died from too much amphetamine in her system, having a stressful encounter as a police officer likely played a role in why someone would have two strokes the following day. But police officers are trained for stressful encounters, and that obviously is a far cry from being able to claim that any pro-Trump supporter murdered Sicknick.I'll have much more on this story as it unfolds. A significant amount of media accountability is warranted. But you're seeing why there is so much resentment and so many attacks on platforms like this one that permit journalists to report and analyze facts and dissect media narratives without being constrained by liberal orthodoxies and pieties and while remaining immune from liberal pressure tactics: it's one of the few ways that real dissent to their lies and propaganda can be aired.Truth matters. Noble lies are never justified no matter the cause, especially in journalism. But these employees of corporate media outlets have been taught the exact opposite model: that their primary obligation is to please and flatter the partisan agenda and political sensibilities of their audience even if it means lying or recklessly spreading unproven theories to do it. That is their profit model. And they have trained their audiences to want and expect this and that is why they never feel compelled to engage in any self-critique or accountability when they get caught doing this: their audiences want to be lied to xe2x80x94 they are grateful for it xe2x80x94 and would prefer that they not admit they did it so that their partisan interests will not be undermined. What is most depressing about this entire spectacle is that, this time, they exploited the tragic death of a young man to achieve their tawdry goals. They never cared in the slightest about Officer Brian Sicknick. They had just spent months glorifying a protest movement whose core view is that police officers are inherently racist and abusive. He had just become their toy, to be played with and exploited in order to depict the January 6 protest as a murderous orgy carried out by savages so primitive and inhuman that they were willing to fatally bash in the skull of a helpless person or spray them with deadly gases until they choked to death on their own lung fluids. None of it was true, but that did not matter xe2x80x94 and it still does not to them xe2x80x94 because truth, as always, has nothing to do with their actual function. If anything, truth is an impediment to it.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I want to see Marcy apologize to you first.I take issue with this:   xe2x80x9c...Ashli Babbitt, who was shot point blank in the neck by Capitol Police xf0x9dx97xb1xf0x9dx97xb2xf0x9dx98x80xf0x9dx97xbdxf0x9dx97xb6xf0x9dx98x81xf0x9dx97xb2 xf0x9dx97xafxf0x9dx97xb2xf0x9dx97xb6xf0x9dx97xbbxf0x9dx97xb4 xf0x9dx98x82xf0x9dx97xbbxf0x9dx97xaexf0x9dx97xbfxf0x9dx97xbaxf0x9dx97xb2xf0x9dx97xb1).xe2x80x9dUnarmed does not *not dangerous.* It would seem the cop was justified as she was attempting to breach the broken glass doors in the barricaded Speaker's Lobby - outside the Chamber, which was occupied by Capitol staff and members of Congress- and had a riotous, angry, and loud mob of people behind her.Do I remember something wrong?Glenn, you present important facts but your tone is so hyperbolic that itxe2x80x99s distracting.

When one large news outlet publishes a false story based on whispers from anonymous security state agents with the CIA or FBI, other news outlets quickly purport that they have xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d the false story, in order to bolster its credibility (oh, it must be true since other outlets have also confirmed it). This is an obvious scam xe2x80x94 they have not xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d anything but rather merely acted as servants to the same lying security state agents who planted the original false story xe2x80x94 but they do it over and over, creating the deceitful perception that a fake story has been \"confirmedxe2x80x9d by multiple outlets, thus bolstering its credibility in the public mind. It was the favored tactic for spreading debunked Russiagate frauds and is still used. One of the most vivid examples occurred in December, 2017, when CNN falsely reported what it hyped as \"a major bombshellxe2x80x9d: that Donald Trump, Jr. had advance access to the WikiLeaks archive. Within an hour, NBC Newsxe2x80x99 Ken Dilanian and CBS News both claimed they had xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d this fairy tale. When it turned out that it was a complete lie, all based on a false date on an email to Trump Jr., these outlets embarrassingly corrected it hours later and then simply moved on as if it never happened, never explaining how multiple outlets could possibly have all xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d the same blatant falsehood.On Thursday night, The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources (of course), claimed that the FBI gave a \"defensive briefingxe2x80x9d to Rudy Giuliani in 2019, before he traveled to Ukraine, that he was being targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign to hurt Joe Biden's candidacy, yet he ignored the FBI's warnings and went anyway. The Post also claimed that the right-wing news outlet OANN was similarly briefed. The claim about Giuliani not only predictably ricocheted all over social media and cable news xe2x80x94 where, as usual, it was uncritically treated as Truth xe2x80x94 but it was shortly thereafter xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d by both NBC Newsxe2x80x99 de facto CIA spokesman Ken Dilanian along with The New York Times.What was the problem with this story? It was totally false. The FBI never briefed Giuliani on any such thing. As a result, The Washington Post had to append this \"correctionxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 meaning a retraction xe2x80x94 to the top of its viral story:At first, The New York Times attempted to quietly change the story to delete the false claims without noting they were doing so. But upon being pressured, they finally faced up to what they did and posted their own retraction at the very bottom of the story that reads: xe2x80x9cCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated whether Rudolph W. Giuliani received a formal warning from the F.B.I. about Russian disinformation. Mr. Giuliani did not receive such a so-called defensive briefing.xe2x80x9d In their self-glorifying jargon, the Paper of Record did not spread Fake News xe2x80x94 perish the thought xe2x80x94 but merely \"misstatedxe2x80x9d the truth. Meanwhile, NBC News, at the top of its false story, posted this explanation for why Dilanian got the story completely wrong:An earlier version of this article included an incorrect report that Rudolph Giuliani had received a defensive briefing from the FBI in 2019 warning him that he was being targeted by a Russian influence operation. The report was based on a source familiar with the matter, but a second source now says the briefing was only prepared for Giuliani and not delivered to him, in part over concerns it might complicate the criminal investigation of Giuliani. As a result, the premise and headline of the article below have been changed to reflect the corrected information.This credibility carnage was so glaring that even CNN acknowledged that xe2x80x9cthe corrections are black eyes to the newsrooms which have aggressively reported on Giuliani's contacts with Ukrainians in his attempts to dig up dirt on then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.xe2x80x9d But there have been so many similar \"black eyesxe2x80x9d like this one, indeed far worse ones, over the last five years, and they never change anything that causes these \"black eyesxe2x80x9d because they want to do this: spreading disinformation is their function. Indeed, as I have asked almost every time these debacles happen: how is it possible that these same outlets keep \"confirmingxe2x80x9d one another's false stories? And the answer is obvious: they all serve as mouthpieces for the same propagandists and disinformation agents of the CIA, FBI and other security state agencies. In this capacity, they dutifully write down and vouch for what they are told by those agencies to publish without any investigative scrutiny or confirmation. The most amazing part of it all is that when they try to malign independent journalists for not doing \"real reportingxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 real reporting like these corporate outlets do xe2x80x94 this is what they mean by real reporting: getting a call from the CIA or FBI and being told what to say. And that is why they so often mislead and deceive the public with blatant disinformation in unison.It is hard to overstate how far and wide this false story about the FBI's briefing to Giuliani spread, how many millions of people it deceived. The two liberal cable outlets, MSNBC and CNN, instantly convened panels to analyze the grave implications of this revelation, accusing Giuliani of knowingly spreading Russian disinformation (by which they meant, as usual, truthful information that reflects poorly on Democratic Party leaders) even though he was told not to keep doing so by the FBI. As usual, the MSNBC program of Nicolle Wallace xe2x80x94 who has magically transformed from a disinformation agent for the Bush/Cheney White House into an identical disinformation agent but now for the DNC xe2x80x94 was one of the leaders in spreading this lie. She brought on former FBI agent and current MSNBC analyst Clint Watts to do just that (just as Wallace dramatized how Brian Sicknick died by falsely claiming that \"they beat a Capitol Police Officer to death with a fire extinguisher\" and repeatedly glorified Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) as a great and truthful leader on COVID): This is all par for the course. But in this case, dozens of journalists for NBC News, MSNBC, CNN and The Washington Post xe2x80x94 the very outlets that purported to \"confirmxe2x80x9d the false story xe2x80x94 as well as activists and scholars who purport to combat \"disinformation,xe2x80x9d spread it all over Twitter and, days later, have left it up, even knowing the story is false, while not even telling their followers that the story was false and has been retracted. In preparation for writing this article, I spent the day notifying close to a dozen of these media luminaries that their false tweet remained up and asked whether they intend to take it down and/or correct the false tweet. Only one xe2x80x94 NBC White House Correspondent Geoff Bennett xe2x80x94 responded. He did so by blocking me on Twitter, while leaving the false tweet up, uncorrected. Put another way, this NBC News journalist is well aware that he lied to close to 200,000 followers when he falsely told them that xe2x80x9cRudy Giuliani and Sen. Ron Johnson were warned in late 2019 that they were targets of a Russian operation intended to damage Joe Biden politicallyxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 a story (as it pertains to Giuliani) which even his own outlet has retracted xe2x80x94 but simply refuses to note that it was false or to remove the false posting. This NBC News reporter is knowingly spreading Fake News all over Twitter.The number of journalists with major outlets who spread this fake news and never corrected it is too high to comprehensively chronicle. But even when you tell them that the story they spread is false and that they never corrected it or deleted the false tweet, they just leave it up anyway: knowingly spreading lies. Basically as an experiment to measure how willing they are to knowingly lie even when caught, I sent a large number of them inquiries similar to the one I sent to NBCxe2x80x99s Bennett. With the exception of NBC's Bennett xe2x80x94 who blocked me but left up the lying claim xe2x80x94 virtually all just left their false tweets up with no notation to the people they lied to that the story was retracted. Here, for instance, are my similar interactions with Washington Post reporter Dan Zak, frequent Russia analyst for CNN and The Daily Beast Michael Weiss, CNN's Senior Global Affairs analyst Bianna Golodryga, and Bloomberg columnist Tim O'Brien, all of whom spread this story and have left it up uncorrected:Here is just a random sampling of five more people or sites who spread this lie all over the internet and refuse to take it down or tell their followers the tweet was false: MSNBC's ex-FBI agent Clint Watts, Washington Post reporter Greg Jaffe, Center for American Progress' Max Bergmann who runs the liberal think tank's \"Moscow Project,xe2x80x9d Nina Jankowicz: who says she \"studies disinformationxe2x80x9d(!)  for the Wilson Center, and the liberal \"newsxe2x80x9d site Raw Story:Meanwhile, MSNBC's Chris Hayesxe2x80x99 show, All In, has left up its tweet with the false story and refuses to take it down (though, after I shamed them for it, they finally noted in a subsequent tweet an hour or so ago that the story was retracted), while MSNBC's viral tweet with the false story also remains up:Perhaps the most extraordinary example is The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler. He is held out by that paper as its official \"fact-checker\": the person responsible for decreeing what is true and what is false. Not only did he post the fake claim about Giuliani's briefing, and not only did he never delete it or note that it was false even after his own paper retracted it and even after I advised him of this, but xe2x80x94 just two days ago! xe2x80x94 he endorsed a denunciation by CNN's Jake Tapper of an RNC official who tweeted out a story that turned out to be false (namely, that DHS was providing copies of Kamala Harrisxe2x80x99 book to migrant children). \"Says quite a bit that this tweet is still up even after the story was proven a lie,xe2x80x9d the CNN anchor reasonably said. Yet while Kessler endorsed that lecture, he himself did exactly the same thing: let stand a retracted story without removing the tweet or telling his audience that it was false:As I indicated, this is just a small sampling of journalists and activists who spread this false story and simply left the lie standing and uncorrected even after being advised. The list of shame also includes MSNBC's second-favorite neocon (after Bill Kristol) Jennifer Rubin of The Washington Post. And while the false articles from the three outlets went viral, the tweets and other notations addressing the retractions were noted by only a tiny fraction who spread the original claim.Every journalist, even the most honest and careful, will get things wrong sometimes, and trustworthy journalists issue prompt corrections when they do. That behavior should be trust-building. But when media outlets continue to use the same reckless and deceitful tactics xe2x80x94 such as claiming to have xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d one another's false stories when they have merely served as stenographers for the same anonymous security state agents while \"confirmingxe2x80x9d nothing xe2x80x94 that strongly suggests a complete indifference to the truth and, even more so, a willingness to serve as disinformation agents for various official factions. And when a journalist spreads a false story and knows they have done so, but still refuses to correct it or remove it xe2x80x94 as is the case for many of the above examples xe2x80x94 then they are just tawdry liars who should be driven out of journalism. But they are not driven out and will not be because the reality is that their job is to spread disinformation as long as it is in servitude to the right factions (the CIA, FBI and DNC) and against those who are ideologically disfavored.Again we see the core truth of U.S. corporate journalism. The outlets that most vocally claim to condemn disinformation and fake news xe2x80x94 to the point of agitating in favor of corporate and online censorship of their critics and competitors in the name of combating it xe2x80x94 are the most prolific, aggressive and destructive disseminators of disinformation. Their refusal to remove the fake news here even after I explicitly notified them of it just makes this latest example a particularly vivid one.Update, May 3, 2021, 20:20 pm. ET: Subsequent to publication of this article, The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler posted a correction to Twitter:May 4th 2021This is not hard to do.

That happened due to allegations from a political consultant, Jean Kim, that Stringer groped her eighteen years ago, in 2003. Despite no evidence presented that any of this happened, and despite this being the only assault accusation ever voiced about Stringer during his decades in public life, and despite Kim never having once claimed any of this even when she was working for a rival candidate who was ultimately defeated in 2013 by Stringer, and despite the sudden emergence of this accusation as Stringerxe2x80x99s mayoral campaign was surging, and despite evidence showing that Kim was highly misleading in several of her statements, and despite Stringerxe2x80x99s claims that Kim had been his girlfriend for several months accompanied by vehement denials of wrongdoing, numerous leftist groups and politicians who had endorsed him repudiated his candidacy within days of the emergence of this allegation, issuing statements which treat Kimxe2x80x99s claims as proven truth and depict Stringer as a vile sexual predator. That is because, as has been seen repeatedly, the prevailing mentality in left-liberal politics is that even grave life-destroying accusations are to be treated as true without the need for any evidence. They casually and with apparent glee ruin peoplexe2x80x99s reputations and lives without batting an eye the second someone utters an allegation of sexual misconduct. And one is required to mindlessly accept such accusations as truth xe2x80x94 never ask for evidence if it is true xe2x80x94 if one wishes to remain in good standing in those circles and to avoid being smeared oneself as an apologist for sexual misconduct.To understand what is being done to Stringer, look at the identical smear campaign that Democrats launched in Massachusetts in August, 2020. Congressman Richie Neal (D-MA) is a walking embodiment of everything sleazy and slimy in U.S. politics. First elected to the House back when Ronald Reagan was still President, the Massachusetts Democrat, 72, is now in his 16th House term, and occupies the all-powerful position of Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which controls legislation governing revenue, taxes, social programs, and tariffs. Neal's entire career has been funded by large corporations, insurance companies and banks, and that is who he dutifully serves. He has used his immense power to block virtually every piece of legislation that his corporatist funders oppose but which left-wing populists favor. If you're on the left, and you actually think the political goals you claim are important, there would be few priorities more pressing than removing Congressman Neal from power.In 2020, the left was presented with precisely that opportunity. Over the past sixteen years, Neal has had no credible challengers in his Democrat-heavy district. But last year, 31-year-old Alex Morse xe2x80x94 a dynamic and gay five-term Mayor of Holyoke xe2x80x94 announced he would challenge Neal in the Democratic primary. Progressive groups lined up behind Morse with endorsements and donations, and polls began showing him closing in on Neal. This appeared to be one of the best opportunities in years to remove one of the sleaziest corporatists from power. But then the left sabotaged it. The College Democrats of Massachusetts released a perfectly timed letter accusing Morse of predatory behavior: namely, that he had sought sex with and dated young adults, and had consensual sex with several of them, including students at Amherst where he taught a class as an outside lecturer (such relationships are not banned by university guidelines). When launching these accusations, the College Democrats group also dramatically announced that they had banned Morse from attending any of their events, as if he were some sort of menace. There were no \"victimsxe2x80x9d claiming he had coerced let alone assaulted anyone. But no matter. Even as Morse denied wrongdoing, the same leftist groups and politicians which had endorsed him xe2x80x94 The Sunrise Movement, The Working Families Party, Justice Democrats, Rep. Jaamal Bowman (D-NY) xe2x80x94 quickly condemned him and renounced their support, said they were xe2x80x9cpausingxe2x80x9d their support, or demanded he xe2x80x9cmake meaningful efforts to repair any harm hexe2x80x99s caused.xe2x80x9d They had no need for any investigation let alone evidence: they were willing to endorse a narrative xe2x80x94 based on decades of bigoted stereotypes xe2x80x94 that a gay man was a sexual predator of young males, even if doing so meant returning Richie Neal back to his perch as Committee Chairman. The local Sunrise Movement group repudiated Morse in a statement that disgustingly proclaimed that xe2x80x9cwe believe all survivorsxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9crape culture runs deep in our societyxe2x80x9d: rape culture and survivors, for sex between consenting adults. Industry groups that long supporting Neal began plastering the airwaves with ads condemning Morse as a sexual predator who was exploiting his relationship with young men. And anyone who stood up to defend Morse and demand evidence of wrongdoing was vilified by the left as either an apologist for sexual predators or themselves likely some kind of pedophile. Those are the tactics the left uses to prevent anyone from demanding basic evidentiary support for accusations before they are used to wreck the lives of their targets. As Matt Taibbi observed in defense of Morse, much of this was just an extension of the now-standard left-liberal culture that casts adults as victims based on the flimsiest of claims:This terror of a world separated into victimizers and victims has already ruined journalism, where a new class of reporters is so locked into the idea that every second of airtime or line of an editorial is an exercise of power that theyxe2x80x99ve begun demanding the removal of alternative political viewpoints from their publications xe2x80x94 other ideas make them feel literally unsafe.The flamboyant insistence of these leftist groups that their causes (such as saving the climate) are global emergencies is a fraud, since xe2x80x94 based on the vaguest, most dubious and most trivial allegations xe2x80x94 they were willing to re-empower one of the worst corporatist obstacles to their supposedly urgent progressive goals. As The New York Times put it: xe2x80x9cwithin hours after the story broke, Mr. Morse went from role model to pariah. Progressive groups said they would stop campaigning for him.xe2x80x9dAs it turned out, reporters Daniel Boguslaw and Ryan Grim, working with others at The Intercept, uncovered conclusive evidence proving that the allegations against Morse were the by-product of a coordinated smear campaign engineered by state Democratic Party officials and opportunistic College Democrats hoping for a job with Neal. One of the conniving little ringleaders even purposely lured Morse into online discussions about dating by pretending to pursue him so that they could then weaponize those chats against him. One member of the College Democrats warned the group that they would be exploiting an age-old trope about gay men as predators, but they did not care. Destroying Morse was their only goal. Once Grim and Boguslaw revealed the truth, the College Democrats ended up apologizing to Morse. The State Party launched an investigation to determine who was to blame for this filthy smear campaign, and xe2x80x94 with Neal safely re-elected xe2x80x94 they issued a report admitting the State Democratic Party Chairman broke party rules with his involvement.But it was just pure luck that, this time, the evidence emerged proving that Morse was the victim, not the perpetrator. Had it not been for a brave student disturbed by what was being done, Morsexe2x80x99s life would have been ruined, forever plagued by false accusations of being a sex pest. Once that truth was reported, these leftist groups xe2x80x94 which had not bothered to wait for evidence before trying to destroy Morsexe2x80x99s reputation xe2x80x94 re-endorsed him, but by then it was too late. The damage was done. As The New York Times noted, xe2x80x9cPolitical careers usually donxe2x80x99t survive allegations like these.xe2x80x9d Neal cruised to victory by double digits, leading The New York Times to pose this question in its headline about Morsexe2x80x99s vindication:The answer, as it turns out, is a resounding no. It changed nothing. The left is yet again repeating its malicious destruction of a personxe2x80x99s reputation xe2x80x94 again, one of their own xe2x80x94 based on nothing other than evidence-free, highly opportunistic accusations. New York City Democrats are currently holding their primary election to select their candidate to run for Mayor. Given how blue the city is, it is highly likely the primary winner will become Mayor. For months, polls have shown two center-left candidates anathema to the city's progressives xe2x80x94 former presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Brooklyn Borough President and police captain Eric Adams xe2x80x94 in the lead. The only progressive candidate with any viable chance to win is Stringer, the former Manhattan Borough President and current City Comptroller. He has placed a strong third in most polls behind Yang and Adams, and has been closing in on Adams.The recognition that Stringer is the only left-wing candidate with a viable chance to beat the two centrists has resulted in a pile of recent endorsements from many of the same progressive groups and politicians who hopped on board the Morse train, including the Sunrise Movement, the Working Families Party and Rep. Bowman. The latest poll shows Stringer in third place, the only candidate other than front-runners Yang and Adams with double digits. All other candidates xe2x80x94 including the other two progressive candidates: Maya Wiley and Dianne Morales xe2x80x94 are well behind, bunched together in single digits.But Stringerxe2x80x99s candidacy suffered a likely fatal blow last week when a woman named Jean Kim xe2x80x94 who Stringer says was a former girlfriend xe2x80x94 claimed that eighteen years ago, in 2003, the candidate xe2x80x9crepeatedly groped me [and] put his hands on my thighs and between my legsxe2x80x9d without her consent. Just as was true with Alex Morse, this accusation suddenly materialized, said The New York Times, right xe2x80x9cas he had appeared to catch momentumxe2x80xa6.In a number of recent polls, Mr. Stringer had appeared to be virtually tied or just behind Mr. Adams.xe2x80x9d Kim never once, over the last eighteen years since this assault allegedly happened, voiced these accusations publicly xe2x80x94 even as Stringer ran for numerous high political offices, winning many elections. In a press conference alongside his wife of eleven years, Elyse Buxbaum, Stringer vehemently denied the allegations, explaining that he had dated Kim for several months many years ago and remained friendly with her until 2013, when she became angry with him when he refused her request for a job in his successful citywide campaign for City Comptroller, and so instead went to work for his opponent, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. There is zero evidence to support Kimxe2x80x99s accusations against Stringer. No other woman has accused him of similar behavior either before or since. And Kim said nothing even when, after having her job request rejected by Stringer, she went to work for Stringerxe2x80x99s main opponent in the 2013 Democratic primary for Comptroller, where such allegations obviously would have helped Spitzer avoid his ultimate defeat to Stringer. By contrast, there is evidence to affirmatively create at least rational doubt about whether any of this happened. When Kim first came forward, she claimed she was Stringerxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cintern,xe2x80x9d to create the perception that Stringer had exploited a young, deeply vulnerable woman the way Bill Clinton did in the Oval Office with then-22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinksy. That framing predictably caused newspaper headlines all over the city to use this narrative of vulnerability (xe2x80x9cFormer Campaign Intern Accuses Scott Stringer Of Sexual Abuse, Harassmentxe2x80x9d) only for it turn turn out that Kim was thirty years old at the time. Kim also denied that she had sought employment with her supposed abuser in his 2013 race, only for Stringer to produce an email she had sent along with her resumxc3xa9 doing exactly that. Moreover, as Substack reporter Michael Tracey documented, Stringerxe2x80x99s accuser xe2x80x9cis a registered lobbyist in New York and has a previous business relationship with one of his rival NYC mayoral candidates, Kathryn Garcia (who swiftly called on Stringer to drop out of the race).xe2x80x9dBut none of this mattered to the same leading left-wing groups and politicians who instantly abandoned Alex Morse as soon as those allegations emerged. That is because in left-wing political culture, evidence is not needed for accusations to be deemed true and to be used to destroy a personxe2x80x99s reputation built over decades. Just like free speech, they do not believe in due process when it comes to vilifying someone publicly xe2x80x94 at all xe2x80x94 nor do they recognize the importance of not assuming someone guilty without evidence. They are tyrannical cowards who, sheep-like, jump into line the minute they hear an allegation of this type and repudiate the person accused without the slightest regard for whether he actually did anything wrong. They are too afraid of the recriminations from suggesting that evidence should be required.As a result, within days of Kimxe2x80x99s accusation about what happened in 2003, many leading left-wing groups announced they were withdrawing their support for Stringer. Worse, they issued statements in which they took the truth of these accusations for granted xe2x80x94 exactly as they did to Alex Morse xe2x80x94 and in which they all but accused Stringer of being a predator and sexual abuser. Left-wing state legislators such as Julia Salazar, followed by Rep. Bowman, withdrew their endorsement. The climate group Sunrise Movementxe2x80x99s New York chapter announced that they xe2x80x9cstand with and believe survivors of violence of any kind, and that includes Jean Kim,xe2x80x9d and demanded Stringer xe2x80x9center a victim-informed restorative justice process, contingent upon Kimxe2x80x99s desires.xe2x80x9d Praising xe2x80x9cKimxe2x80x99s brave testimony recounting her trauma,xe2x80x9d the group said it xe2x80x9cimmediately rescinds our endorsement of Scott Stringer and calls for him to drop out of the race for Mayor of New York City.xe2x80x9d In its announcement rescinding their endorsement, the Working Families Party condemned Stringer because, they said, he xe2x80x9cfailed to acknowledge and consider his responsibilityxe2x80x9d for the harm he caused xe2x80x94 in other words, they were un-endorsing him because he had the temerity to deny that this actually happened.Do you see what is glaringly absent from these tribunals? There is no recognition of even the remotest possibility that the person may be wrongfully accused, innocent of what they are alleged to have done. In their orgy of self-righteous recriminations and ritualistic denunciations, that thought never enters their mind, nor does any requirement of evidence. Even after these same groups endured the humiliating spectacle of having ratified a bigoted and coordinated attack on Alex Morse as a sex predator only for them to have to have to reverse themselves and re-endorse him, they have learned nothing from that travesty because this is the predominant ethos of left-liberal culture.It should go without saying that none of this means that Stringer is innocent. Just as the accusers should not be presumed to be truthful, the same is true of the accused. Sometimes accusers lie and sometimes wrongdoers falsely deny wrongdoing. The point xe2x80x94 which is only controversial in contemporary left-liberal circles xe2x80x94 is that some convincing evidence is required before it is fair and just to destroy someonexe2x80x99s reputation and treat them as guilty.ShareThese are far from the only examples. The left did exactly the same thing to Nancy Pelosixe2x80x99s progressive 2020 challenger, the Pakistani-American Shahid Buttar. When unproven allegations emerged from several white women that Buttar was guilty of sexism and mistreatment of his staff, the left immediately sided with the white women, concluding that it would be better to send Pelosi back to her position as House Speaker and thus abandoned Buttarxe2x80x99s campaign. In July, The Intercept published an irresponsible article that gave voice to these allegations against Buttar, only to go back weeks later and quietly insert major new paragraphs that called into serious doubt the credibility of Buttarxe2x80x99s main accuser (an inserted note at the top of that article now simply states: xe2x80x9cEditorxe2x80x99s note: This article was updated to include additional context around the allegations made by [accuser] Elizabeth Croydon.xe2x80x9d Several of Buttarxe2x80x99s supporters accused the women of using racist tropes against Buttar. One said: xe2x80x9cThe Democratic Socialists of America San Francisco are about to ruin the political career of a Brown Muslim man based on no evidence at all because a bunch of mediocre Karens complained he was mean to them.xe2x80x9d Needless to say, when the stakes are high enough, progressives kick this framework of presumed-guilt and Believe-Women to the curb. When Joe Biden was the presumptive nominee against Donald Trump, they quickly vilified his accuser Tara Reade as a mentally unwell liar xe2x80x94 just as they did in the 1990s to the group of women who accused Bill Clinton of various levels of sexual impropriety, including rape. When something like the presidency is at stake, female accusers of key Democratic male leaders are to be mocked and destroyed, not believed.That is because there is no discernible principle at play. It is only about power. Why was the highly educated Christine Blasey Ford to be believed with no evidence in her accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, and why is Stringerxe2x80x99s accuser, political consultant Jean Kim, to be believed, but Reade was not, even though she had more evidence of contemporaneous complaints to support her allegations?But the far more important point is that any culture that is willing to destroy reputations and lives based on totally unproven accusations is one that is inherently corrupt and unjust. The ability to destroy someonexe2x80x99s life with nothing more than an uncorroborated claim voiced more than eighteen years after the alleged incident is a power with which nobody should be trusted.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I am perhaps a bit of a purist but I take offense at Greenwald's presumption that the people he's rightly critiquing are on the left.

Opening his address, Biden stated, \"I took the oath of office xe2x80x94 lifted my hand off our family Bible xe2x80x94 and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"Yes, the January 6th siege on the U.S. Capitol building, often alluded to as an \"insurrection,\" was an embarrassing day for our country. But to suggest that it was \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War\" is disingenuous at best. At worst, it's a malicious attempt to whitewash the history of attacks carried out both by and on the government that have had much more catastrophic results.Apart from the September 11th terrorist attacks that targeted the country's financial system, Al Qaeda terrorists attacked the defenders of our democracy when a hijacked American Airlines flight 77 flew into the Pentagon. Were it not for the heroes who resisted against the hijackers of United flight 93, Al Qaedaxe2x80x99s attempt to fly a commercial airline into the White House or U.S. Capitol building would have come to fruition. Despite being a horrific tragedy, 9/11 has been dismissed by some as being explicitly a \"foreign attack,\" not one from within.Subscribe nowSo, let's explore attacks on our democracy from within.Following 9/11, the Bush administration, in conjunction with Congress, expedited the passage of the Patriot Act, a wide-sweeping national security law that infringed on the civil liberties of every American in the name of fighting terror. The Fourth Amendment became a relic of the past as the government's power to surveil and spy on its own citizens reached its peak. Individuals who shared names with persons of interest or suspected terrorists, including U.S. citizens, landed on government no-fly lists, restricting their right to freely move about the country for dubious reasons and with no due process or recourse. And even worse, many had their right to due process eviscerated when they were detained by the newly-created Department of Homeland Security and found themselves at Guantanamo Bay without even being charged with a crime.Yet this is not the first time that American citizens, or even permanent residents for that matter, had their rights infringed upon by the government.As the FBI was formed in the early 20th century, Americans whose ideologies were at odds with the government's interests were often targeted by the agency's longest-serving director, J. Edgar Hoover. In the eyes of the FBI Director, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a suspected communist given his ties to Stanley Levison, whose suspected pro-communist activities were monitored by the FBI in the 1950s. Although Dr. King has been viewed as one of the most consequential leaders in American history due to his role in the civil rights movement, at the time, Hoover and many in the FBI viewed him as a threat to our democracy, ushering in communism under the guise of xe2x80x9ccivil rights.xe2x80x9d The FBI infamously blackmailed Dr. King by sending him a letter advocating he commit suicide. The Red Scare was so severe in the United States that the government actively sought to chip away at Americans' First Amendment rights to prevent the spread of such ideas. And through the Lavender Scare in the early 1950s, thousands of people were forced out of government service for simply for being suspected of being homosexual. When the United States entered the First World War, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Espionage Act of 1917 into law, which then gave way to the Sedition Act of 1918. These two laws worked in conjunction to strip away the First Amendment rights of every American and demand undying fealty towards the U.S. government. Expressing even the slightest bit of criticism of the U.S. or associating with groups like the Communist Party could result in, at the very least, a government wiretap, and, at worst, a hefty prison sentence and possible execution. In the same token that President Franklin Roosevelt interned approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II in fear that they might side with the Japanese Empire, the Espionage and Sedition Acts under President Wilson explicitly targeted German-born American residents during World War I, with over 2,000 arrested and sent to internment camps.While the FBI has had its fair share of attacking our democracy, its intelligence counterpart, the CIA, has interfered in the affairs of other countries countless times. As Americans decry countries like Russia, China, and Iran for interfering in our electoral process, the CIA has had a hand in interfering in the affairs of well over a dozen nations. For as many autocratic regimes as the CIA tried to topple in places like Cuba, Indonesia, and the Dominican Republic, the CIA had a hand in the overthrow of democracies as well in countries like Iran, Chile, and Guatemala.For decades, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover xe2x80x94 the notorious FBI Director after whom the law enforcement's DC headquarters continues to be named xe2x80x94 assaulted democracy in every way imaginable. Hoover kept dossiers on political leaders to enforce his will over them. FBI agents routinely infiltrated anti-war and civil rights groups as part of its COINTELPRO program and other similar domestic spying activities. And the NSA notoriously spied on millions of American citizens without warrants.There is a strong argument to be made that the CIA is responsible for interfering in American democracy, too.The first impeachment of President Donald Trump in 2019 occurred when a whistleblower within the CIA filed a complaint after Trump had a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, in exchange for $400 million in military aid.But it didn't end there.The story of the Russian Bounty program on U.S. troops in Afghanistan that broke publicly in the summer of 2020 made a significant impact in tipping the scales during the 2020 presidential election. The CIA produced the initial intelligence assessment in 2019, which later broke publicly in the summer of 2020, further cementing the perception that Trump was in the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putinxe2x80x93xe2x80x93a claim that was exacerbated when then-President Trump dismissed the allegations outright, calling it \"fake news.\" However, in April 2021, Trump would be vindicated as the U.S. government revealed that the Intelligence Community had \"low to moderate confidence\" in the intelligence assessment. In other words, there was little evidence to prove that it was real.On top of these government abuses that took place on a wide scale impacting every American, there was a long-drawn-out period since the Civil War that impacted millions of Americans that has had consequences that last to this day: Jim Crow.Following the Civil War and Reconstruction, the implementation of Jim Crow laws in Southern former slave states not only segregated black people from the white population, but also barred them from fully participating in society as equal members. Through policies like poll taxes, literacy tests, and increased residency requirements, black people had their right to vote stripped away, essentially removing them from the political process, keeping them further ostracized from society. It was authoritarianism in the most sinister manner, targeting a racial group that was perceived to be subhuman to their white counterpart, all in the name of protecting democracy.Despite all these examples in which our democracyxe2x80x93xe2x80x93and the democracies of other nationsxe2x80x93xe2x80x93were attacked with our government playing the central antagonist, there were a half dozen times where the sitting U.S. president and, by extension, our democracy were attacked from within. Since the Civil War, four U.S. presidents were assassinated (Lincoln in 1865, Garfield in 1881, McKinley in 1901, and Kennedy in 1963) and two presidents were injured in assassination attempts (Roosevelt in 1912 and Reagan in 1981). These were six attacks on the duly elected leaders of the people of the United States. Not only does changing the leadership alter the trajectory for a nation, but due to its status, it has lasting effects for the rest of the world.If President Biden is to suggest that the siege on Capitol Hill on January 6th was \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War,\" then we should demand that our leaders be honest about what does and does not constitute an \"attack on our democracy.\" Attacks on our democracy aren't just reserved for storming the U.S. Capitol and targeting U.S. lawmakers with historically low approval ratings. If that's the case, that a certain set of rules only applies to the political elite and not the people, then it's safe to say that we do not truly live in a democracy.Siraj Hashmi is a journalist based in Washington, DC. He is the co-host of Habibi Bros. with Mujahed Kobbe, and creator of the List.Subscribe nowFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Let's look at a few things: worst pandemic - a manufactured crisis that was mostly solved before he took office; worst economy - only bad because of government overreach in shutting down the economy; worst attack on our democracy - that's the most laughable.  The riot was \"kindergarten\" level stuff; Biden would freeze with terror if an attack on our democracy was carried out by even a JV team in comparison.There is one fact about January 6th that renders all the outrage bullshit, and I can't believe it gets so little attention.   That fact: some of the Capitol Police let the protesters in.Unpack that.   Imagine ANY protest that might happen at the Capitol -- BLM, anti-war, pro-Trump, climate change, etc. -- and ask yourself what would happen if the police stepped aside and said \"come on in!\"Some people would go in.   Always.   There you have it.   This one fact, that police INVITED people to come in, is both necessary and sufficient to create a so-called \"insurrection.\"   It would lead to the outcome we saw every time, with every protest, for any passionate cause.  Now if protesters came in with guns and started shooting police or members of Congress, then you would not have the conditions necessary and sufficient to create THAT outcome.   But that didn't happen.   What did happen would happen in any similar case.   People running around, cheering, and generally not knowing what to do with themselves.   And eventually leaving or getting arrested.  In short, this was MANUFACTURED.   The police hold 100% responsibility for the fact that the Capitol was overrun by a handful of protesters from a large group of protesters who decided to take the police up on their invite.   Their actions created the basis for sweeping narrative change, new security protocols, and novel legislation on domestic terrorism that we know was already being considered in the background, just waiting for a casus belli. This begs the question: did anyone who wanted this justification have any role in the Capitol Police decision to invite in the rabble?

No more hosannas to the creative destruction of the marketplace. Only mute submission to the magisterium of the Department of Consumer Affairs.Back in the 1980s, the City Council capped the number of licenses available to street vendors at just 5,100 - a fraction of what demand could support. For this reason, as many as 20,000 vendors across the city are forced to operate without the proper paperwork, risking confiscation of their inventory, heavy fines, and even jail time for the crime of selling things that other people want to buy. That number increased considerably last year as coronavirus-related shutdowns swelled the ranks of the unemployed. Being New Yorkers, many did what they had to do: adapt to survive.After years of delay, the City Council was finally forced to confront the need to regularize the cityxe2x80x99s sprawling informal sector. It passed legislation authorizing an annual increase in the licensing cap so that existing vendors could be gradually integrated into the formal market. Responsibility for enforcement was transferred from the NYPD to the Department of Consumer Affairs. It was all an elegant solution to one of the happier problems associated with New Yorkxe2x80x99s famously industrious population. Andrew Yang for President would have been proud. But Andrew Yang for Mayor was singing from a different hymnal. The former prophet of disruption now bowed before false idols of brick and mortar. Why?In the ensuing controversy, that wasnxe2x80x99t the question that most preoccupied Yangxe2x80x99s critics. They were more concerned with what his comment revealed about his character - lack of empathy for the downtrodden, or perhaps even latent racism against Black and brown street vendors. But that is a serious mistake. Not only is it alienating to voters who may identify with Yang, it's a missed opportunity to explain why, no matter how much they might like him, he will never identify with them.On February 25th, Yang toured the Flushing neighborhood in Queens accompanied by Timothy Chuang, co-chair of the Flushing Business Improvement District. BIDs are nonprofit entities that lobby for investment, subsidies, and favorable tax and regulatory treatment on behalf of local businesses and property owners in urban commercial districts. For many years, BIDs were a major opponent of raising the cap on vendor licenses, fearing competition from more nimble competitors with lower overhead costs and cheaper prices. The extent to which street vendors and traditional retailers actually compete for the same customer base is disputed, but the perception that they do is strong among New Yorkxe2x80x99s petite bourgeoisie. As unlicensed vendors multiplied during the pandemic, the Flushing BID expressed its displeasure over what it considered to be lax enforcement.Chuang made sure Yang heard that displeasure too. On their tour, they met with Flushing tea shop owner Samuel Lin, who leaned on Yang hard over the vendor issue:xe2x80x9cLin said that Flushing rents are expensive, and his two milk tea shops have to pay rent even if their business is damaged. But the unlicensed vendors on the street donxe2x80x99t have to worry about rent, sell cheaper goods, and sometimes even hinder traffic. It has a negative impact on the recovery of small businesses.xe2x80x9d [Translation from Chinese.]Yang seemed to take the hint. Unlicensed vending was the first thing mentioned when he tweeted about his visit later in the day. But perhaps because he didnxe2x80x99t describe xe2x80x9cenforcementxe2x80x9d as the solution to this problem hexe2x80x99d been hearing so much about, his remark drew virtually no attention at the time.Campaign finance disclosures show that Chuang gave $500 to Yangxe2x80x99s campaign two days before their tour. But given what he can command through online fundraising, Yang probably didnxe2x80x99t need Chuangxe2x80x99s money. What he really needs are outerboro Virgils to guide him through the inferno of neighborhood power brokers and validate him in the eyes of voters. The price is lip service to their various pet issues while on the campaign trial, and presumably, compliance with their demands while in office.Notably, Yangxe2x80x99s local guides donxe2x80x99t confine themselves to local politics. In September 2019, Chuang donated $1,000 to Ted Yoho, the far-right former congressman from Florida, perhaps most famous for calling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a xe2x80x9cfucking bitchxe2x80x9d in July of last year. Less well-known is that during his time in Congress, Yoho was a vocal advocate for Taiwan and an aggressive American posture toward mainland China. Chuang is a major figure in Flushingxe2x80x99s Taiwanese business community.A review of Yohoxe2x80x99s top 100 donors in the 2020 cycle reveals that Yoho and his longtime aid Kat Cammack, who succeeded him in Congress, together received nearly $20,000 in contributions from at least nine people in Flushingxe2x80x99s Taiwanese business community. All of them are major donors to Yangxe2x80x99s mayoral campaign. They include Jimmy Tsai and Warren Huang of Amerasia Bank, Ming Chiang of the Yu Shan Company, and Thomas Chen of Crystal Window and Door Systems Ltd - whose factory was the first stop on Yangxe2x80x99s tour of Flushing.A few days prior, Yang toured Chinatown in Manhattan and dined at the Hwa Yuan restaurant, an iconic Chinatown institution owned and operated by its head chef, Chen Lieh Tang. Joining Yang for the meal was James Tierney Tang, Chen Liehxe2x80x99s son, who serves on the Board of Directors of the Chinatown BID. Just like its counterpart in Flushing, the Chinatown BID emphasizes two issues it sees as the foundation of a successful commercial district: cleanliness and safety. Before the BIDxe2x80x99s creation in 2012, local residents and activists came together under the banner of the Coalition Against a Chinatown BID to express concern about its potential impact on their most vulnerable neighbors:xe2x80x9cThe 'clean and safe' programs that BIDs initiate to attract consumers can limit citizen voice and dislocate less desirable citizens through the privatization of public space. In some instances, allegations have been made that these programs involve the removal of the homeless and unauthorized vendors.xe2x80x9dUltimately, the BID was established anyway under the leadership of Executive Director Wellington Chen. In his most recent public interview, Chen can be heard pushing the xe2x80x98clean and safexe2x80x99 mantra used to justify the arrest and eviction of unlicensed Chinatown vendors for years, as well as bemoaning pending increases in New Yorkxe2x80x99s minimum wage. Chen gave $250 to Yangxe2x80x99s campaign in March 2021.But itxe2x80x99s Tangxe2x80x99s support that is particularly notable. On his Instagram, Tang captioned a photo with Yang taken on the day of his visit to Hwa Yuan with the following: xe2x80x9cHonored to host mayoral candidate, Andrew Yang! Even as a lifelong Republican, I have got his back! Hexe2x80x99s got New Yorkxe2x80x99s.xe2x80x9d The only other politician to have the honor of a photo op on Tangxe2x80x99s IG is Linsday Graham. The only NYC official to have the honor of his campaign contributions was Nicole Malliotakis, during her 2017 challenge to Bill de Blasio, whom he routinely excoriates over the problem of street homelessness on his Facebook. Tang donated $2,000 to Yangxe2x80x99s campaign in January 2021.Yangxe2x80x99s idea to bring the hammer down on old ladies selling jade earrings on Canal Street without a permit provoked intense backlash from New York progressives. The common refrain was that because unlicensed street vendors are almost exclusively poor people of color, such a policy would be racist - and implicitly, that Yang himself was racist for suggesting it. While racism isnxe2x80x99t a huge sin for the notorious consultants running Yangxe2x80x99s campaign, a bad news cycle certainly is.After a day of reflection with his confessors at Tusk Strategies, Yang received his penance: a public act of contrition before the media. xe2x80x9cI regret that I took on such a frankly complicated and nuanced issuexe2x80x9d online, he told reporters, and that he made it xe2x80x9cseem like itxe2x80x99s a zero-sum game between unlicensed street vendors and retailers.xe2x80x9dThat didnxe2x80x99t placate Scott Stringer, the cityxe2x80x99s Comptroller and Yangxe2x80x99s best-funded opponent, who held a press conference in the Hispanic neighborhood of Jackson Heights in Queens denouncing Yangxe2x80x99s remark as a racist attack on Black and brown New Yorkers. He was flanked by a woman holding a sign reading: xe2x80x9cmore churros, less cops,xe2x80x9d an allusion to the churro ladies who were arrested and hauled off from subway stations across the city in late 2019, Andrew Cuomoxe2x80x99s solution to a largely fictional crime wave roiling the cityxe2x80x99s tabloids.But an inconvenient fact for the race-reductionist narrative around this issue is that some of the strongest criticism of street vending, unlicensed or otherwise, comes from immigrant- and minority-owned small businesses. From the New York Postxe2x80x99s coverage of the decision to raise the licensing cap:xe2x80x9cMore than 150 food merchants and business groups sent a letter to Speaker Corey Johnson expressing opposition to the proposed law. Many of the signatories are members of the New York State Latino Restaurant, Bar and Lounge Association.One of them is restaurateur Sandra Jaquez, who owns Il Sole and Sa-Tacos eateries on Dyckman Street in Manhattanxe2x80x99s Inwood neighborhood. Jaquez said there was a street vendor who sold tacos a block from her Mexican restaurant.xe2x80x98I sell Mexican food and tacos. Thatxe2x80x99s what the Mexican street vendor was selling,xe2x80x99 she said. xe2x80x98Thatxe2x80x99s super direct competition. If I sell tacos for $4.50 and a street vendor a block away sells tacos for $2.50, the people are going to go the street vendor.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9dThis didnxe2x80x99t stop the media from proclaiming that Yang had imperiled his chances with New Yorkxe2x80x99s communities of color. xe2x80x9cThis [is] a great issue for Stringer: unites progressives behind him, allows him to make inroads into a very up-for-grabs Latino vote. Would think hexe2x80x99d ride this for a while,xe2x80x9d said David Freedlander of New York Magazine. xe2x80x9cAnd hexe2x80x99s standing here today with two state legislators, both the first Colombians elected to state office in NY. Both representing districts that are predominantly Latino and immigrant,xe2x80x9d replied Gloria Pazmino of NY1. Another New YorkMagazine writer concluded that the whole episode marked xe2x80x9can unforced error for the leading candidate for mayor.xe2x80x9d But did it?The lesson here isnxe2x80x99t that this movement of the multiracial ownership class is correct about the vending issue or any other. The point is that they exist. Andrew Yang wants their vote, and hexe2x80x99s asking them for it.From the beginning of his campaign, Yangxe2x80x99s strategy has been to identify the most high-salience, emotionally charged issue within a particular segment of the electorate and pledge to champion the most common opinion on it, whatever it may be. The result is a motley collection of policy stances and points of emphasis that would puzzle anyone trying to identify the underlying ideology. Police crackdowns on taco vendors (for Hispanic restaurateurs). Protecting the one-shot admissions exam to the cityxe2x80x99s specialized high schools (for Asian immigrant families). Hysterical opposition to the BDS movement (for the Hassidic Jews). No requirements for secular education in yeshivas (Hasidim again).What unites them all? Andrew Yangxe2x80x99s desire to be the mayor, thatxe2x80x99s what. Hexe2x80x99s betting he can stitch together a coalition of cross-ethnic reaction as a makeshift base, then let money and name recognition take care of the rest. And so far, itxe2x80x99s working. Not only has Yang led in every public survey, but in the latest and highest quality poll of the race to date with crosstabs, he led among every single racial group - Hispanics included. So much for the churro ladiesxe2x80x99 revenge.How should a left candidate respond to such a socially corrosive gambit? They could start by acknowledging that BID executives and chain restaurant kingpins arenxe2x80x99t the only constituencies that might find Yangxe2x80x99s rhetoric attractive. New York is filled with mom-and-pop grocers, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, standalone beauty shops and bakeries and bodegas, and licensed street vendors. They too are mostly low- and middle-income people of color. Many of them are immigrants. All of them have been crushed by the pandemic and nearly abandoned by the government. Telling them that theyxe2x80x99re xe2x80x9cguided by a white supremacist racist ideologyxe2x80x9d if theyxe2x80x99ve ever felt a pang of resentment toward vendors probably isnxe2x80x99t a great opener.How about this instead: when Yang says hexe2x80x99s the savior of small business, you could point out that one of his biggest donors is Long Deng, the former Finance Chair of the New York Republican Party and grocery mogul whose company did nearly $100 million in business in 2020. Or that Dengxe2x80x99s wife and sister, both executives at his company, also maxed out to Yang. Or that Yang received thousands from at least 31 other individuals employed by three different companies owned by the Deng family: iFresh, New York Mart, and Strong America Ltd. Or that Deng was a delegate for Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention and a major donor to his 2020 campaign. Whatever hexe2x80x99s cooking up with Yang, they probably donxe2x80x99t have your needs in mind.Or you could let the Timothy Chuangs of the world tell immigrant-run small businesses that their real problem is the unlicensed dumpling cart outside their restaurant, and then call them white supremacists if theyxe2x80x99ve ever wondered if he was right. Though realistically, thatxe2x80x99s probably the best way to convince them he is.Matthew Thomas is a writer and researcher in Queens, NY.

The opposite is true: the more aggressively and recklessly you spread CIA narratives or pro-war manipulation, the more rewarded you will be in that world. The classic case is Jeffrey Goldberg, who wrote one of the most deceitful and destructive articles of his generation: a lengthy New Yorker article in May, 2002 xe2x80x94 right as the propagandistic groundwork for the invasion of Iraq was being laid xe2x80x94 that claimed Saddam Hussein had formed an alliance with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.  In February, 2003, on the eve of the invasion of Iraq, NPR host Robert Siegel devoted a long segment to this claim. When he asked Goldberg about xe2x80x9ca man named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,xe2x80x9d Goldberg replied: xe2x80x9cHe is one of several men who might personify a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda.xe2x80x9dNeedless to say, nothing could generate hatred for someone among the American population xe2x80x94 just nine months away from the 9/11 attack xe2x80x94  more than associating them with bin Laden. Five months after Goldberg's New Yorker article, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force to impose regime change on Iraq; ten months later, the U.S. invaded Iraq; and by September, 2003, close to 70% of Americans believed the lie that Saddam had personally participated in the 9/11 attack.Goldberg's fabrication-driven article generated ample celebratory media attention and even prestigious journalism awards. It also led to great financial reward and career advancement. In 2007, The Atlantic's publisher David Bradley lured Goldberg away from The New Yorker by lavishing him with a huge signing bonus and even sent exotic horses to entertain Goldberg's children. Goldberg is now the editor-in-chief of that magazine and thus one of the most influential figures in media. In other words, the person who wrote what is arguably the most disastrous article of that decade was one most rewarded by the industry xe2x80x94 all because he served the aims of the U.S. security state and its war aims. That is how U.S. corporate journalism functions.Another illustrative mascot for this lucrative career path is NBC's national security correspondent Ken Dilanian. In 2014, his own former paper, The Los Angeles Times, acknowledged his \"collaborativexe2x80x9d relationship with the CIA. During his stint there, he mimicked false claims from John Brennan's CIA that no innocent people were killed from a 2012 Obama drone strike, only for human rights groups and leaked documents to prove many were. A FOIA request produced documents published by The Intercept in 2015 that showed Dilanian submitting his \"reportingxe2x80x9d to the CIA for approval in violation of The LA Timesxe2x80x99 own ethical guidelines and then repeating what he was told to say. But again, serving the CIA even with false \"reportingxe2x80x9d and unethical behavior is a career benefit in corporate media, not an impediment, and Dilanian rapidly fell upward after these embarrassing revelations. He first went to Associated Press and then to NBC News, where he broadcast numerous false Russiagate scams including purporting to xe2x80x9cindependently confirmxe2x80x9d CNN's ultimately retracted bombshell that Donald Trump, Jr. obtained advance access to the 2016 WikiLeaks archive.  On Monday, CNN made clear that this dynamic still drives the corporate media world. The network proudly announced that it had hired Natasha Bertrand away from Politico. In doing so, they added to their stable of former CIA operatives, NSA spies, Pentagon Generals and FBI agents a reporter who has done as much as anyone, if not more so, to advance the scripts of those agencies.Bertrand's career began taking off when, while at Business Insider, she abandoned her obsession with Russia's role in Syria in 2016 in order to monomaniacally fixate on every last conspiracy theory and gossip item that drove the Russiagate fraud during the 2016 campaign and then into the Trump presidency. Each month, Bertrand produced dozens of Russiagate articles for the site that were so unhinged that they made Rachel Maddow look sober, cautious and reliable. In 2018, it was Jeffrey Goldberg himself xe2x80x94 knowing a star CIA propagandist when he sees one xe2x80x94 who gave Bertrand her first big break by hiring her away from Business Insider to cover Russiagate for The Atlantic. Shortly thereafter, she joined the Queen of Russiagate conspiracies herself by becoming a national security analyst for MSNBC and NBC News. From there, it was onto Politico and now CNN: the ideal, rapid career climb that is the dream of every liberal security state servant calling themselves a journalist. Her final conspiratorial article for The Atlantic before moving to Politico is the perfect illustration of who and what she is:CNN's new national security star was no ordinary Russiagate fanatic. There was no conspiracy theory too unhinged or evidence-free for her to promote. As The Washington Post's media reporter Erik Wemple documented once the Steele Dossier was debunked, there was arguably nobody in media other than Rachel Maddow who promoted and ratified that hoax as aggressively, uncritically and persistently as Bertrand. She defended it even after the Mueller Report corroborated virtually none of its key claims. In a February, 2020 article headlined xe2x80x9cHow Politicoxe2x80x99s Natasha Bertrand bootstrapped dossier credulity into MSNBC gig,xe2x80x9d Wemple described how she was rewarded over and over for \"journalismxe2x80x9d that would be regarded in any healthy profession with nothing but scorn: Where therexe2x80x99s a report on Russian meddling, therexe2x80x99s an MSNBC segment waiting to be taped. Last Thursday night, MSNBC host Joy Reid xe2x80x94 subbing for xe2x80x9cAll Inxe2x80x9d host Chris Hayes xe2x80x94 turned to Politico national security reporter Natasha Bertrand with a question about whether Trump xe2x80x9cwantsxe2x80x9d Russian meddling or whether he canxe2x80x99t accept that \"foreign help is there.xe2x80x9c Bertrand responded: xe2x80x9cWe donxe2x80x99t have the reporting that suggests that the president has told aides, for example, that he really wants Russia to interfere because he thinks that itxe2x80x99s going to help him, right?xe2x80x9dNo, we donxe2x80x99t have that reporting xe2x80x94 though therexe2x80x99s no prohibition against fantasizing about it on national television. Such is the theme of Bertrandxe2x80x99s commentary during previous coverage of Russian interference, specifically the dossier of memos drawn up by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. With winks and nods from MSNBC hosts, Bertrand heaped credibility on the dossier xe2x80x94 which was published in full by BuzzFeed News in January 2017 xe2x80x94 in repeated television appearances.Wemple systematically reviewed the mountain of speculation, unproven conspiracies and outright falsehoods Bertrand shoveled to the public as she was repeatedly promoted. But it was the document that gave us deranged delusions about pee-pee tape blackmail and Michael Cohen's trip to Prague that was her crown jewel: xe2x80x9cThe Bertrand highlight reel features a great deal of thumb-on-scale speculation regarding the dossier,xe2x80x9d Wemple wrote.And when information started being declassified that proved much of Bertrand's claims about collusion to be a fraud, she complained that there was too much transparency, implying that the Trump administration was harming national security by allowing the public to know too much xe2x80x94 namely, allowing the public to see that her reporting was a fraud. A journalist who complains about too much transparency is like a cardiologist who complains that a patient has stopped smoking cigarettes, or like a journalist who voluntarily rats out her own source to the FBI or who agitates for censorship of political speech: a walking negation of the professional values they are supposed to uphold. But that is Natasha Bertrand, and, to the extent that there are some people who still believe that working at CNN is desirable, she was just rewarded for it again yesterday xe2x80x94 just as journalists who rat out their own sources to the FBI and advocate for internet censorship are now celebrated in today's rotted media climate.Bertrand's trail of journalistic scandals and recklessness extend well beyond her Russiagate conspiracies. Last October, she published an article in Politico strongly implying that Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe was speaking without authorization or any evidence when he said Iran was attempting to undermine President Trump's 2020 presidential campaign. But last month,  the Biden administration declassified an intelligence report which said they had \"high confidencexe2x80x9d that Iran had done exactly what Ratcliffe alleged: namely, run an influence campaign to hurt Trump's candidacy. A former national security official, Cliff Sims, said upon hearing of CNN's hiring that he explicitly warned Bertrand's editors that the story was false but they chose to publish it anyway.It was also Bertrand who most effectively laundered the extremely significant CIA lie in October, 2020 that the documents obtained by The New York Post about the Biden family's business dealings in China and Ukraine were \"Russian disinformation.xe2x80x9d Even though the John-Brennan-led former intelligence officials admitted from the start that they had no evidence for this claim, Bertrand not only amplified it but vouched for its credibility by writing that the Post's reporting xe2x80x9chas drawn comparisons to 2016, when Russian hackers dumped troves of emails from Democrats onto the internet xe2x80x94 producing few damaging revelations but fueling accusations of corruption by Trumpxe2x80x9d (that those 2016 DNC and Podesta documents produced xe2x80x9cfew damaging revelationsxe2x80x9d would come as a big surprise to the five DNC operatives, led by Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who were forced to resign when their pro-Hillary cheating was revealed). It was this Politico article by Bertrand that was then used by Facebook and Twitter to justify their joint censorship of the Post's reporting in the weeks before the 2020 election, and numerous media outlets xe2x80x94 including The Intercept xe2x80x94 gullibly told their readers to ignore the revelations on the ground that these authentic documents were \"Russian disinformation.xe2x80x9d Yet once it did its job of helping defeat Trump, that claim was debunked when even the intelligence community acknowledged it had no evidence of Russian involvement in the appearance of these materials, and Hunter Biden himself admitted he was the subject of a federal investigation for the transactions revealed by those documents. But even when her fantasies and conspiracies are debunked, Bertrand xe2x80x94 like a good intelligence soldier xe2x80x94 never cedes any ground in her propaganda campaigns. She was, needless to say, one of the journalists who most vocally promoted the CIA's story xe2x80x94 published as Trump was announcing his plans to withdraw from Afghanistan xe2x80x94 that Russia had paid bounties to the Taliban for the death of U.S. soldiers. Yet even when the U.S. intelligence community under Joe Biden admitted last week that it has only \"low to moderatexe2x80x9d confidence that this even happened xe2x80x94 with the NSA and other surveillance agencies saying they could find no evidence to corroborate the CIA's story xe2x80x94 she continued to insist that nothing had changed with the story, denying last week on a Mediaite podcast that anything had happened to cast doubt on the original story: xe2x80x9cI think itxe2x80x99s much more nuanced than it being a walk-back. I donxe2x80x99t think thatxe2x80x99s right actually.\"Even a cursory review of Bertrand's prolific output reveals an endless array of gossip, conspiracy and speculative assertions masquerading as journalism. The commentator Luke Thomas detailed many of these transgressions on Monday and correctly observed that xe2x80x9carguably no single reporter has contributed more to the deranged and paranoid national security fantasies of the center-left than Natasha Bertrand. She's an embarrassment to her profession and will, therefore, fit right in at CNN.xe2x80x9d As Thomas noted, beyond all of Bertrand's well-documented and consequential propaganda, xe2x80x9cshe sees conspiracies and perfidiousness around every corner,xe2x80x9d pointing to this demented yet highly viral tweet that deciphered comments from former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) as inadvertently revealing some secret scheme to expand Trump's pardon powers. That scheme, like most of her speculative predictions, never materialized.Then there is her garden-variety ethical scandal. In January, freelancer Dean Sterling Jones accused Bertrand of stealing his work without credit or payment. In a post he published, Jones documented how he emailed Bertrand a draft with reporting he had been working on, and in response she agreed to report it jointly with him on a co-byline. Yet two weeks later, the article appeared in The Atlantic with Bertrand as the only named reporter. Only after Jones complained did they insert a sentence into the story begrudgingly citing him as a source. xe2x80x9cBy my count,xe2x80x9d Jones wrote, xe2x80x9cBertrandxe2x80x99s article contains at least six unequivocal examples of direct copying and revisions of my work.xe2x80x9d When he published his post detailing his accusations, Bertrand arrogantly refused even to provide comment to the freelancer whose work she pilfered.Natasha Bertrand has spent the last five years working as a spokesperson for the alliance composed of the CIA and the Democratic Party, spreading every unvetted and unproven conspiracy theory about Russiagate that they fed her. The more loyally she performed that propagandistic function, the more rapidly she was promoted and rewarded. Now she arrives at her latest destination: CNN, not only Russiagate Central along with MSNBC but also the home to countless ex-operatives of the security state agencies on whose behalf Bertrand speaks. Once again we see the two key truths of modern corporate journalism in the U.S. First, we have the Jeffrey Goldberg Principle: you can never go wrong, but only right, by disseminating lies and propaganda from the CIA. Second, the organs that spread the most disinformation and crave disinformation agents as their employees are the very same ones who demand censorship of the internet in the name of stopping disinformation. I've long said that if you want to understand how to thrive in this part of the media world, you should study the career advancement of Jeffrey Goldberg, propelled by one reckless act after the next. But now the sequel to the Goldberg Rise is the thriving career of this new CNN reporter whose value as a CIA propagandist Goldberg, notably, was the first to spot and reward.Update, Apr. 27, 2021, 4:32 pm ET: Just as several readers predicted would happen, other corporate journalists responded to this article by engaging in a rank-closing defense of Bertrand, principally by accusing me of misogyny for publishing this critique of her reporting. Unlike me, they evidently view adult professional woman in highly influential media roles (such as Bertrand) as too fragile to endure critiques of their journalism, unlike adult men, who they apparently believe are strong enough to handle criticisms: a regressive view of the sexes right out of the 1950s. They also apparently skipped over the entire first section of this article detailing how Jeffrey Goldberg and Ken Dilanian xe2x80x94 both men xe2x80x94 were the pioneers of the CIA-serving career trajectory Bertrand is now following. But the oddest aspect of this media reaction, the only one that makes it worth noting here, is that misogyny allegations against me for this article were led by GQ's own Russiagate fanatic Julia Ioffe, even though Ioffe herself, in 2019, publicly accused Bertrand of a rather serious ethical violation that probably should be added to the list:For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Be careful, Glenn. Soon they'll be calling you a misogynist.Let's be clear, we aren't talking about journalists.   That's not the line of work.This is counter-intelligence. As William Casey allegedly said: \"Wexe2x80x99ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.\"Operation Mockingbird was discovered and documented by Congress' Church Committee in 1975; that program placed CIA operatives in high positions throughout mainstream media.NOTHING was done to ensure this did not continue.Treating CNN or NPR or FOX or any of that as \"news\" or \"journalism\" is like calling our actions in Vietnam or Iraq or West Africa during the slave trade \"humanitarian.\"  It is a pretense that should be abandoned. Our narrative is being constructed; our enemies labeled; our heroes fabricated; our consent manufactured.   Glenn and others have documented this ad nauseum for years.   This is not, as people often claim, corporations making shit up because \"it sells.\"   It doesn't.   The \"news\" part of these media empires is spittle in a bucket of profits; its value is in its ability to shape the world for the other, more profitable ventures.   Our mainstream media empire is an intelligence asset.   Full stop.   And \"reporters\" like Natasha Bertrand and Rachel Maddow are either direct employees or themselves assets.   They aren't arrogant.   They aren't bad journalists.   They aren't lazy or unprofessional.   They do a job and they do it reasonably well.   It's just a different job than most Americans believe.

Today, we are initiating this new section of our Substack, entitled \"Outside Voices.\" The first article is from Leighton Woodhouse, reporting on the exploitation of anti-free-speech laws to target various activists as \"domestic extremists\" or \"domestic terrorists\" on both the right and left, with a focus on how this repressive model is being weaponized against animal rights activists (one of the groups, along with anti-government and right-wing organization, classified as \"domestic threats\" by last month's Homeland Security Report which I reported). We have other freelance articles in the pipeline and expect to publish them regularly. We are looking for articles that relate to the topics I report on and cover but which are not necessarily duplicative of what I already do. I'm excited to experiment with this program, including, for instance, publishing writers who disagree with one another on a particular topic and letting them debate. The podcast I had been doing with Ben Mora, \"After Hours,\" was put on temporary hiatus due to Ben's conflicting commitments, and we have decided for the same reason to permanently cease production (anyone who purchased a year subscription specifically on that podcast page can contact us for a pro-rated refund if you wish). I'm excited about this new freelance program because it will enable us to expand the topics we cover here and provide a platform to young journalists seeking to report, analyze and comment with full independence and freedom to dissent from prevailing corporate media orthodoxies. As you know, we count exclusively on and are grateful for reader support for everything we do here. The more support we receive, the more we will be able to expand our journalism in general and specifically provide a platform for a wide range of new voices to earn a living doing independent journalism.  Give a gift subscriptionBy Leighton WoodhouseLast May, several months into a global pandemic that had capsized the economy, hog farmers had a problem on their hands. With restaurants closed, demand for their product had evaporated. With outbreaks shuttering meat processing plants all over the country, they had nowhere to send their animals to be slaughtered. If kept alive, the pigs would quickly outgrow facilities designed to hold them only for highly abbreviated lives, and the costs of feeding and watering them would become astronomical.So some major pork producers, among them Iowaxe2x80x99s largest, Iowa Select Farms, made a horrifying decision. They would mass exterminate their animals in one fell swoop, using a technique that promised efficiency for themselves but guaranteed incomprehensible suffering for the pigs.The method was called xe2x80x9cventilation shutdown,xe2x80x9d and it entailed, basically, roasting the pigs alive. Workers would close all of the vents into the barns, shut down the air conditioning, and pipe steam into the buildings until the animals died by asphyxiation or hyperthermia, a process that took several hours. Then a worker would walk through the piles of corpses with a captive bolt gun, shooting whatever stragglers had survived.The company, however, was unaware that there was a whistleblower within their ranks. An ISF truck driver named Lucas Walker, who had long been appalled by the companyxe2x80x99s treatment of its pigs, had informed an activist named Matt Johnson of the companyxe2x80x99s plans. Johnson snuck into the barns, placed hidden cameras, and recorded video and audio of the massacre to later release to the news media.Neither Johnson nor Walker is what most people of conscience would consider a dangerous political extremist. They had no desire to bring any physical harm to anyone; on the contrary, they were moved by the cause of putting a halt to needless suffering. But both a new state law in Iowa and a bill currently being considered in Congress could render them such in the eyes of the criminal justice system. It is just one example of the moral hazard posed by the ongoing effort in Congress and within the Biden administration to erect a new domestic security state apparatus in response to the Trump years and the Capitol Riot xe2x80x94 an effort the CIA has joined, while animal rights groups and environmental campaigners have been explicitly listed among its targets.In 2011, Iowa Select Farms had been the subject of an undercover investigation by the animal rights group Mercy For Animals. Liz Pachaud, an animal rights activist with MFA, had taken a job at the farm and, over the course of four months, documented appalling conditions there with an undercover camera. When the gruesome footage was released, it caused a major crisis for ISF, with numerous grocery chains dropping the company as a supplier.The following year, the animal agriculture industry successfully lobbied the Iowa state legislature to make what Pachaud had done a crime. The law was one of many so-called xe2x80x9cAg Gagxe2x80x9d laws in agricultural states across the country, which make undercover investigations on factory farms by animal rights groups unlawful (an estimated 99 percent of animals raised for meat are factory farmed; the very few small family farms that are left are being systematically driven out of business by the industrialization and economic consolidation of the industry). As Ag gag laws effectively criminalize speech, some of the more sloppily written among them have been subject to successful constitutional challenges; Iowaxe2x80x99s 2012 law was among them. In 2019, a federal judge struck down Iowaxe2x80x99s 2012 law.That same month, a new Governor took office in Iowa. Kim Reynolds had won her office in 2018 with the conspicuous help of Iowa Select Farms. ISFxe2x80x99s co-owners, Jeff and Deborah Hansen, have donated nearly $300,000 to Governor Reynolds. During the 2018 race, Deborah was the Governorxe2x80x99s biggest individual campaign contributor. Kim Reynolds had been the guest of honor at the Hansensxe2x80x99 family foundation.Governor Reynolds had barely been in office a month before a newly re-written Ag Gag bill was introduced into the legislature. By summer, she had signed it into law.Now, Johnson has become the first person to be charged under the 2019 Ag Gag law for attempting to enter one ISF facility. He is facing a separate wiretap charge for the hidden cameras in the barn where the company carried out its ventilation shutdown. In the meantime, yet another Ag Gag law has passed through the Iowa legislature, which increases penalties for the crime of planting hidden cameras in animal agriculture facilities. Governor Reynolds is expected to sign the new bill into law any day now.As should surprise nobody who lived through the political aftermath of 9/11, these laws were passed under the pretext of combatting xe2x80x9cterrorism.xe2x80x9d Radical animal rights and environmental activists have, in fact, long been among the FBIxe2x80x99s top xe2x80x9cdomestic terrorismxe2x80x9d targets, as well as targets of draconian new legislation. In 2006, at the behest of the pharmaceutical and animal agriculture industries, Congress passed a law specifically defining animal rights activism aimed at xe2x80x9cdamaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprisexe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 whether or not violence was involved xe2x80x94 as xe2x80x9cterrorism.xe2x80x9d Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), the group Johnson belongs to (I used to cover DxE as a reporter and have since become a member myself), was the subject of a major FBI investigation over the xe2x80x9ctheftxe2x80x9d of two dying piglets from a factory farm. After he was discovered, the FBI interviewed Walker, asking him if DxE sells drugs or guns to finance their activism, and tried to recruit him as an informant into their activities.ShareThis dismal history should be an obvious cautionary tale about the hazards of enhancing the statexe2x80x99s power to surveil and prosecute people for politically motivated activity, beyond the ample criminal laws already on the books. But in the wake of the January 6 MAGA Capitol Riot, progressives, in particular, have gained an appetite for more.Currently, a bill with 196 Democratic co-sponsors (and 3 Republicans) is before Congress, which would begin to build the legal and bureaucratic architecture for an interagency domestic terrorism response unit within the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. The legislation is explicitly a response to the Capitol Riot and is pointed particularly at xe2x80x9cWhite supremacistxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cneo-Nazixe2x80x9d groups xe2x80x94 a particularly unsympathetic and uncontroversial cast of culprits.But the PATRIOT Act was also purported to target only the most hateful, murderous people in the world xe2x80x94 Islamic terrorists xe2x80x94 before it metastasized into a massive surveillance state infrastructure that spied on literally every single American with an internet connection. Are we to expect that a domestic analogue to the PATRIOT Act will draw the line at violent sociopathic racists? The intelligence community demonstrably does not: a recently declassified report lists animal rights and environmental activists, abortion activists on both the pro-life and the pro-choice sides, anarchists, and anti-capitalists as potential domestic terrorist threats.If wexe2x80x99ve learned anything from the last few years, itxe2x80x99s that corporations are all too eager to co-opt the progressive rhetoric du jour, whether to sell sneakers or to protect themselves against workplace discrimination lawsuits. And the FBI has been more than willing to investigate activists engaged in non-violent activities as terrorists under the 2006 Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. A new domestic federal law enforcement bureaucracy dedicated to surveilling and investigating anyone the government claims to suspect is a xe2x80x9cterroristxe2x80x9d would be a bonanza to industries facing concerted activist pressure, whether animal agriculture or fossil fuels, or a company in any industry facing a unionization drive. What possible reason is there to believe that corporations wonxe2x80x99t lobby the Biden administration and future administrations to use their new powers to ensnare activists who campaign against them, all in the name of ridding the country of violent political extremists and xe2x80x9cinsurrectionistsxe2x80x9d?The answer is that there is no reason to believe it, and every reason to believe the hunt for xe2x80x9cdomestic terroristsxe2x80x9d could eventually be turned against anyone with the will and the means to effectively confront those who hold concentrated political and corporate power xe2x80x94 including through strictly non-violent means. A demonstrated willingness to use violence has never been a requisite for law enforcement agencies to brand those they wish to malign as xe2x80x9cterroristsxe2x80x9d, as DxE activists know all too well. All thatxe2x80x99s required is their willingness to use the label.After 9/11, passage of the PATRIOT Act was enabled by the bullying of dissidents in a climate of enforced jingoism. It was dangerous to ask critical questions then; safety was found only in conformity. Wexe2x80x99re in such a moment again, but this time from within a liberal rather than a right-wing consensus. But the outcome will be the same: the hardening of state power, made possible through organized collective hysteria.Subscribe nowFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Will read it, but for the whole project Glenn's description \"not necessarily duplicative\" is not exactly mouth watering.

Two weeks after the Floyd killing, The New York Times said that the xe2x80x9cmoney has come in so fast and so unexpectedly that some groups even began to turn away and redirect donors elsewhere,xe2x80x9d while xe2x80x9cothers said they still could not yet account for how much had arrived.xe2x80x9d Propelled by the emotions and nationwide protest movements that emerged last summer, corporations, oligarchs, celebrities and the general public  opened their wallets and began pouring money into BLM coffers and have not stopped doing so.Where that money has gone has been the topic of numerous media investigations as well as concerns expressed by racial justice advocates. AP noted that BLM's sharing of financial data in February xe2x80x9cmarks the first time in the movementxe2x80x99s nearly eight-year history that BLM leaders have revealed a detailed look at their finances.xe2x80x9d That newfound transparency was prompted by what AP called xe2x80x9clongstanding tensions boil[ing] over between some of the movementxe2x80x99s grassroots organizers and national leaders xe2x80x94 the former went public last fall with grievances about financial transparency, decision-making and accountability.\" In December, ten local BLM chapters severed ties with the national group amidst questions and suspicions over the handling of activities and finances by one of its co-founders, Patrisse Cullors, who had assumed the title of Executive Director. On April 10, The New York Post published an exposxc3xa9 on what it called Cullorsxe2x80x99 xe2x80x9cmillion-dollar real estate buying binge.xe2x80x9d The paper noted that as protests were unfolding around the country, the BLM official was xe2x80x9csnagging four high-end homes for $3.2 million in the US alone, according to property records,xe2x80x9d including a California property valued at $1.4 million. The article also revealed that the self-described Marxist and her partner xe2x80x9cwere spotted in the Bahamas looking for a unit at the Albany,xe2x80x9d an xe2x80x9celite enclave laid out on 600 oceanside acres,xe2x80x9d which xe2x80x9cfeatures a private marina and designer golf course.xe2x80x9d The Post included photos of several of the properties obtained from public real estate listings. In an interview about that Post story with Marc Lamont Hill, Cullors xe2x80x94 except saying she has not visited the Bahamas since the age of 15 xe2x80x94 did not deny the accuracy of the reporting, but instead justified her real estate acquisitions. She denied she had taken a salary from the BLM group, pointing to other income she earns as a professor, author, and a YouTube content creator as the source of this sudden outburst of real estate purchases. She denounced the Post reporting as \"frankly racist, and sexist.xe2x80x9dSo that seems like a perfectly healthy cycle for covering a controversy, obviously in the public interest. In the wake of concerns from activists about where this massive amount of BLM money has gone, The New York Post did its job of unearthing the splurge of real estate acquisitions by the person who controls and directs BLM's budget and who has been a target of accusations and suspicions from activists. Cullors then had the opportunity to publicly provide her side of the story concerning her aggressive and ample financial investments.But then something quite unhealthy and unusual occurred. Five days after publication of that Post article, the Substack journalists Shant Mesrobian and Zaid Jilani reported that Facebook was banning the sharing of that article worldwide on its platform xe2x80x94 similar to what Twitter and Facebook did in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election to The New York Post's reporting on the Biden family's business dealings in China and Ukraine. The Substack reporters noted that Facebook ultimately confirmed the worldwide ban of the Post's reporting to The New York Timesxe2x80x99 media reporter Ben Smith, justifying it on the ground that the article xe2x80x9crevealed personal details about [Cullors] and her residence in violation of Facebookxe2x80x99s community standards.xe2x80x9d In his weekly New York Times Sunday night media column, Smith returned to this subject. When a Facebook lawyer justified the censorship by citing an alleged policy that the tech monopoly will ban any xe2x80x9carticle [which] shows your home or apartment, says what city youxe2x80x99re in and you donxe2x80x99t like it,xe2x80x9d Smith expressed extreme skepticism:The policy sounds crazy because it could apply to dozens, if not hundreds, of news articles every day xe2x80x94 indeed, to a staple of reporting for generations that has included Michael Bloombergxe2x80x99s expansion of his townhouse in 2009 and the comings and goings of the Hamptons elites. Alex Rodriguez doesnxe2x80x99t like a story that includes a photo of him and his former fiancxc3xa9e, Jennifer Lopez, smiling in front of his house? Delete it. Donald Trump is annoyed about a story that includes a photo of him outside his suite at Mar-a-Lago? Gone. Facebookxe2x80x99s hands, the lawyer told me, are tied by its own policies.Presumably, the only reason this doesnxe2x80x99t happen constantly is because nobody knows about the policy. But now you do! Smith was additionally disturbed that Facebook was, in essence, overriding the editorial judgment of news outlets, which grapple every day with how to strike the balance between ensuring the public knows of information in the public interest and protecting a person's right to privacy. For obvious reasons, public figures and organizations xe2x80x94 which both BLM and Cullors undoubtedly are xe2x80x94 are deemed to have a lower expectation of privacy when it comes to what is newsworthy. That is why, for example, the extramarital affairs of Donald Trump or Bill Clinton are deemed newsworthy whereas, outside of the dead-but-returning Gawker sewer, the sex lives of private citizens are not. Yet Facebook accords no deference to the editorial judgments even of the most established media outlets. Instead, they told Smith, xe2x80x9cFacebook alone decides.xe2x80x9dWhatever onexe2x80x99s views are on this particular censorship controversy, there is no doubt that it is part of the highly consequential debate over online free speech and the ability of monopolies like Facebook to control the dissemination of news and the boundaries of political discourse and debate. That is why Smith devoted his weekly column to it. And yet, when Smith approached the standard free speech advocacy groups for comment on this story, virtually none was willing to speak up. xe2x80x9cFacebookxe2x80x99s usual critics have been strikingly silent as the company has extended its purview over speech into day-to-day editorial calls,xe2x80x9d he wrote.Among those groups which insisted that it would not comment on Facebook's censorship of the Post's BLM story was the vaunted, brave and deeply principled free speech organization, the American Civil Liberties Union. xe2x80x9cWe donxe2x80x99t have anyone who is closely plugged into that situation right now so we donxe2x80x99t have anything to say at this point in time,xe2x80x9d emailed Aaron Madrid Aksoz, an ACLU spokesman. Smith said xe2x80x9cthe only criticism he could obtain came from the News Media Alliance, the old newspaper lobby, whose chief executive, David Chavern, called blocking The Postxe2x80x99s link xe2x80x98completely arbitraryxe2x80x99 and noted that xe2x80x98Facebook and Google stand between publishers and their audiences and determine how and whether news content is seen.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9dHow is it possible that the ACLU is all but invisible on one of the central free speech debates of our time: namely, how much censorship should Silicon Valley tech monopolists be imposing on our political speech? As someone who intensively reports on these controversies, I can barely remember any time when the ACLU spoke up loudly on any of these censorship debates, let alone assumed the central role that any civil liberties group with any integrity would, by definition, assume on this growing controversy. In lieu of the traditional, iconic and organization-defining willingness xe2x80x94 eagerness xe2x80x94 of the ACLU to defend free speech precisely when it has been most controversial and upsetting to liberals, what we now get instead are cowardly, P.R.-consultant-scripted excuses for staying as far away as possible: xe2x80x9cWe donxe2x80x99t have anyone who is closely plugged into that situation right now so we donxe2x80x99t have anything to say at this point in time.xe2x80x9d That sounds like something Marco Rubio's office says when asked about a Trump tweet or that a corporate headquarters would say to avoid an inflammatory controversy, not the reaction of a stalwart civil liberties group to a publicly debated act of political censorship.In this particular case, it is not difficult to understand the cause of the ACLU's silence. They obviously cannot defend Facebook's censorship xe2x80x94 affirmatively defending the stifling of political speech is, at least for now, still a bridge too far for the group xe2x80x94 but they are petrified of saying anything that might seem even remotely critical of, let alone adversarial to, BLM activists and organizations. That is because BLM is one of the most cherished left-liberal causes, and the ACLU now relies almost entirely on donations and grants from those who have standard left-liberal politics and want and expect the ACLU to advance that ideological and partisan agenda above its nonpartisan civil liberties principles. Criticizing BLM is a third rail in left-liberal political circles, which is where the ACLU now resides almost entirely, and thus it again cowers in silence as another online act of censorship which advances political liberalism emerges. Indeed, BLM is an organization which the ACLU frequently champions:January 4th 2021Like so many liberal-left media outlets and advocacy groups, the ACLU was suffering financially before they were saved and then enriched beyond their wildest dreams by Donald Trump and the #Resistance movement he spawned. xe2x80x9cThe American Civil Liberties Union this week laid off 23 employees, about 7 percent of the organizationxe2x80x99s national staff,xe2x80x9d announced The Washington Post in April, 2015. But in the Trump era, the money flowed in almost as quickly and furiously as post-Floyd money to BLM. In February, 2017, said AP, the group xe2x80x9cis suddenly awash in donations and new members as it does battle with President Donald Trump over the extent of his constitutional authority, with nearly $80 million in online contributions alone pouring in since the election.xe2x80x9d So that is the donor base it now serves.The ACLU's we-know-nothing routine for abstaining from commenting on Facebook's censorship of the BLM article is, for so many reasons, preposterous. The group funds what it calls its Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, and some of its best lawyers oversee it. Clearly they focus on these issues. And the ACLU in general has taken a firm and borderline-absolutist position against online censorship by Silicon Valley monopolies: principles whose application to this particular case would be easy and obvious. The ACLU has a section of its website devoted to xe2x80x9cInternet Speech,xe2x80x9d and its position on such matters is stated explicitly:The ACLU believes in an uncensored Internet, a vast free-speech zone deserving at least as much First Amendment protection as that afforded to traditional media such as books, newspapers, and magazinesxe2x80xa6.The ACLU has been at the forefront of protecting online freedom of expression in its myriad forms. We brought the first case in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared speech on the Internet equally worthy of the First Amendmentxe2x80x99s historical protections.In a July, 2018 article published on the group's site entitled xe2x80x9cFacebook Shouldn't Censor Offensive Speech,xe2x80x9d the group praised Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's controversial pledge xe2x80x9cto keep Facebook from diving deeper into the business of censorshipxe2x80x9d as xe2x80x9cthe right call.xe2x80x9d Unlike in response to the BLM controversy, the ACLU had no trouble back then recognizing that xe2x80x9cwhat's at stake here is the ability of one platform that serves as a forum for the speech of billions of people to use its enormous power to censor speech on the basis of its own determinations of what is true, what is hateful, and what is offensive.xe2x80x9d The ACLU's stated policy on these controversies could not have been clearer: xe2x80x9cgiven Facebookxe2x80x99s nearly unparalleled status as a forum for political speech and debate, it should not take down anything but unlawful speech, like incitement to violence.xe2x80x9d In light of that principle, how is it remotely hard to denounce Facebook's censorship of the Post's article given that it does not even arguably fall within the scope of those narrow exceptions? Because the ACLU still employs a few old-school civil libertarians among its hundreds of lawyers and staff, those employees manage to do work and express views that are consistent with the ACLU's old-school civil liberties agenda even when contrary to the interests of liberal politics. But the tactics used by the ACLU in those cases to downplay or hide those aberrations are as transparent as they are craven. When three Silicon Valley monopolies united to remove the social media app Parler from the internet in January, 2021 after influential Democratic lawmakers demanded it xe2x80x94 one of the most brute acts of monopolistic censorship yet xe2x80x94 an ACLU lawyer, Ben Wizner, was cited in The New York Times as labelling Parler's destruction xe2x80x9ctroubling,xe2x80x9d telling the paper: xe2x80x9cI think we should recognize the importance of neutrality when wexe2x80x99re talking about the infrastructure of the internet.xe2x80x9d But on the ACLU's highly active and influential Twitter account xe2x80x94 the group's primary platform for promoting its work, expressing its views, and soliciting donations, where it has two million followers and often tweets up to fifty times a day xe2x80x94 the group said absolutely nothing about the removal of an entire social media app from the internet:Indeed, the ACLU xe2x80x94 outside of a few token, hidden statements xe2x80x94 has chosen to play at most a minor role in the key free speech controversies of the day, ones focusing on such weighty matters as internet freedom and online censorship over our political debates by Silicon Valley monopolies. Over the last four years, as Facebook's censorship has expanded rapidly, the ACLU has said little to nothing about it xe2x80x94 including remaining in utter silence about the extraordinary decision to censor pre-election reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop and what it revealed about Joe Biden's business dealings. Last month, Substack reporter Michael Tracey reviewed the ACLU's prior 100 tweets and found that 63 of them were about trans issues while a grand total of one was about free speech and none about due process. A comparison of the number of ACLU statements on online censorship controversies to its manifestations on trans issues similarly reveals a fixation on the latter with very little interest in the former:It goes without saying that the ACLU has every right to devote a huge bulk of its institutional resources and public advocacy to the cause of trans equality if it chooses to do so. But what that reveals is that the group is becoming exactly what its leaders always vowed it would never be: just another garden-variety liberal political advocacy group. After all, there is no shortage of extremely well-financed LGBT groups doing the same advocacy on trans issues. Those LGBT groups shifted their focus almost entirely to trans issues when they won the entire agenda of gay and lesbian equality with the Supreme Court's 2015 legalization of same-sex marriage in all fifty states, and supporting trans rights is the mainstream, standard view of Democratic Party leaders and liberal activists. The ACLU's refusal to engage with growing online censorship is baffling even from the perspective of its liberal politics given that radical leftists are increasingly (and predictably) the targets of tech censorship alongside anti-establishment right-wing voices. Just yesterday, the highly popular trans YouTube host Natalie Wynn of Contrapoints complained that one of her past episodes had just been demonetized and urged: xe2x80x9cFree speech should be reclaimed as an essential leftist issue. We should not surrender the most fundamental civil right to Google LLC in the name of deplatforming rightists and curtailing harassment.xe2x80x9d Wynn's last video, rebutting the views of J.K. Rowling on trans issues, featured Wynn's list of the telltale signs of xe2x80x9cindirect bigotryxe2x80x9d toward trans people, and she included \"free speech advocacy,xe2x80x9d but xe2x80x94 as happens to so many people xe2x80x94 Wynn has apparently reconsidered that view and has discovered the centrality of free speech values now that her own speech is targeted. But agitating for more online political censorship still remains a cause deeply popular among establishment liberals, further explaining the ACLU's reluctance to involve itself in these controversies on the side of free expression.What always distinguished the ACLU in the past xe2x80x94 and what gave it credibility with judges in courtrooms xe2x80x94 was its devotion to and focus on non-partisan free speech, free press and due process causes that were too unpopular or controversial for other groups to touch, particularly liberal groups who could not afford to offend the political sensibilities of Democrats. There are still some isolated occasions when the ACLU does such things xe2x80x94 such as when it spoke up in defense of the NRA against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's efforts to target the group with destruction or when the ACLU recently denounced parts of the Democratsxe2x80x99 H.R.1 xe2x80x9creformsxe2x80x9dxe2x80x94 but the ACLU largely hides those exceptions on its most popular public platforms, and they are becoming increasingly rare.And now we have arrived at the truly depressing and tawdry place where the ACLU is afraid to apply its long-stated principles to denounce Facebook's censorship because the censorship in question happened to be an article that reflected poorly on the sacred-among-liberals BLM group. In the place of brave lawyers and activists defending the constitutional rights and civil liberties even of those people and groups most despised, we have instead a corporate spokesman emailing The New York Times with excuses about why it cannot and will not speak up about a major censorship controversy that has been brewing for two weeks. In that decline one finds the ACLU's sorry trajectory from stalwart civil liberties group into a lavishly funded arm of the Democratic Party's liberal political wing.ShareFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Sorry Glenn, George Floyd was not murdered by the xe2x80x9cMinneapolis Police Department.xe2x80x9d  He was murdered by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer.

That is because he is the only one they could claim was killed by pro-Trump protesters at the January 6 riot at the Capitol. So The New York Times on January 8 published an emotionally gut-wrenching but complete fiction that never had any evidence xe2x80x94 that Officer Sicknick's skull was savagely bashed in with a fire extinguisher by a pro-Trump mob until he died xe2x80x94 and, just like the now-discredited Russian bounty story also unveiled by that same paper, cable outlets and other media platforms repeated this lie over and over in the most emotionally manipulative way possible. Just watch a part of what they did and how:As I detailed over and over when examining this story, there were so many reasons to doubt this storyline from the start. Nobody on the record claimed it happened. The autopsy found no blunt trauma to the head. Sicknick's own family kept urging the press to stop spreading this story because he called them the night of January 6 and told them he was fine xe2x80x94 obviously inconsistent with the media's claim that he died by having his skull bashed in xe2x80x94 and his own mother kept saying that she believed he died of a stroke.But the gruesome story of Sicknick's xe2x80x9cmurderxe2x80x9d was too valuable to allow any questioning. It was weaponized over and over to depict the pro-Trump mob not as just violent but barbaric and murderous, because if Sicknick weren't murdered by them, then nobody was (without Sicknick, the only ones killed were four pro-Trump supporters: two who died of a heart attack, one from an amphetamine overdose, and the other, Ashli Babbitt, who was shot point blank in the neck by Capitol Police despite being unarmed). So crucial was this fairy tale about Sicknick that it made its way into the official record of President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate, and they had Joe Biden himself recite from the script, even as clear facts mounted proving it was untrue.Because of its centrality to the media narrative and agenda, anyone who tried to point out the serious factual deficiencies in this story xe2x80x94 in other words, people trying to be journalists xe2x80x94 were smeared by Democratic Party loyalists who pretend to be journalists as \"Sicknick Truthers,xe2x80x9d white nationalist sympathizers, and supporters of insurrection.For the crime of trying to determine the factual truth of what happened, my character was constantly impugned by these propagandistic worms, as was anyone else's who tried to tell the truth about Sicknick's tragic death. Because one of the first people to highlight the journalistic truth here was former Trump official Darren Beattie of Revolver News and one of the few people on television willing to host doubts about the official story was Tucker Carlson, any doubts about the false Sicknick story xe2x80x94 no matter how well-grounded in truth, facts, reason and evidence xe2x80x94 were cast as fascism and white supremacy, and those raising questions smeared as \"truthersxe2x80x9d: the usual dreary liberal insults for trying to coerce people into submitting to their lies:Because the truth usually prevails, at least ultimately, their lies, yet again, all came crashing down on their heads on Monday. The District of Columbiaxe2x80x99s chief medical examiner earlier this morning issued his official ruling in the Sicknick case, and it was so definitive that The Washington Post xe2x80x94 one of the media outlets that had pushed the multiple falsehoods xe2x80x94 did not even bother to try to mask or mitigate the stark conclusion it revealed:The first line tells much of the story: xe2x80x9cCapitol Police officer Brian D. Sicknick suffered two strokes and died of natural causes a day after he confronted rioters at the Jan. 6 insurrection, the Districtxe2x80x99s chief medical examiner has ruled.xe2x80x9d Using understatement, the paper added: xe2x80x9cThe ruling, released Monday, likely will make it difficult for prosecutors to pursue homicide charges in the officerxe2x80x99s death.xe2x80x9dThis definitive finding from the medical examiner not only rids us of the Fire Extinguisher lie but also the second theory to which these media outlets resorted once they had to face the reality that they spent weeks spreading an outright lie (needless to say, they provided no real accountability or even acknowledgement for the fact that they did spread that Fire Extinguisher tale, instead just seamlessly moving to their next evidence-free claim). They changed their story to claim that pro-Trump protesters still murdered Sicknick, not with a fire extinguisher but with bear spray, which video shows at least one protester using in his vicinity.The problem with that theory is that bear spray is not usually fatal, and the medical examiner's findings ruled out the possibility that this is what caused his death:In an interview with The Washington Post, Francisco J. Diaz, the medical examiner, said the autopsy found no evidence the 42-year-old officer suffered an allergic reaction to chemical irritants, which Diaz said would have caused Sicknickxe2x80x99s throat to quickly seize. Diaz also said there was no evidence of internal or external injuriesxe2x80xa6.Diaz said Sicknick suffered two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by a clot in an artery that supplies blood to that area of the body. Diaz said he could not comment on whether Sicknick had a preexisting medical condition, citing privacy laws.So there goes that second fairy tale. The Post did note the medical examiner's observation regarding Sicknick's participation in defending the Capitol that day that xe2x80x9call that transpired played a role in his condition.xe2x80x9d That of course is true: just as it is true for the two pro-Trump supporters who had heart attacks that day and the other pro-Trump supporter who died from too much amphetamine in her system, having a stressful encounter as a police officer likely played a role in why someone would have two strokes the following day. But police officers are trained for stressful encounters, and that obviously is a far cry from being able to claim that any pro-Trump supporter murdered Sicknick.I'll have much more on this story as it unfolds. A significant amount of media accountability is warranted. But you're seeing why there is so much resentment and so many attacks on platforms like this one that permit journalists to report and analyze facts and dissect media narratives without being constrained by liberal orthodoxies and pieties and while remaining immune from liberal pressure tactics: it's one of the few ways that real dissent to their lies and propaganda can be aired.Truth matters. Noble lies are never justified no matter the cause, especially in journalism. But these employees of corporate media outlets have been taught the exact opposite model: that their primary obligation is to please and flatter the partisan agenda and political sensibilities of their audience even if it means lying or recklessly spreading unproven theories to do it. That is their profit model. And they have trained their audiences to want and expect this and that is why they never feel compelled to engage in any self-critique or accountability when they get caught doing this: their audiences want to be lied to xe2x80x94 they are grateful for it xe2x80x94 and would prefer that they not admit they did it so that their partisan interests will not be undermined. What is most depressing about this entire spectacle is that, this time, they exploited the tragic death of a young man to achieve their tawdry goals. They never cared in the slightest about Officer Brian Sicknick. They had just spent months glorifying a protest movement whose core view is that police officers are inherently racist and abusive. He had just become their toy, to be played with and exploited in order to depict the January 6 protest as a murderous orgy carried out by savages so primitive and inhuman that they were willing to fatally bash in the skull of a helpless person or spray them with deadly gases until they choked to death on their own lung fluids. None of it was true, but that did not matter xe2x80x94 and it still does not to them xe2x80x94 because truth, as always, has nothing to do with their actual function. If anything, truth is an impediment to it.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I want to see Marcy apologize to you first.I take issue with this:   xe2x80x9c...Ashli Babbitt, who was shot point blank in the neck by Capitol Police xf0x9dx97xb1xf0x9dx97xb2xf0x9dx98x80xf0x9dx97xbdxf0x9dx97xb6xf0x9dx98x81xf0x9dx97xb2 xf0x9dx97xafxf0x9dx97xb2xf0x9dx97xb6xf0x9dx97xbbxf0x9dx97xb4 xf0x9dx98x82xf0x9dx97xbbxf0x9dx97xaexf0x9dx97xbfxf0x9dx97xbaxf0x9dx97xb2xf0x9dx97xb1).xe2x80x9dUnarmed does not *not dangerous.* It would seem the cop was justified as she was attempting to breach the broken glass doors in the barricaded Speaker's Lobby - outside the Chamber, which was occupied by Capitol staff and members of Congress- and had a riotous, angry, and loud mob of people behind her.Do I remember something wrong?Glenn, you present important facts but your tone is so hyperbolic that itxe2x80x99s distracting.

It was also, as it turns out, one of the most baseless xe2x80x94 as the intelligence agencies who spread it through their media spokespeople now admit, largely because the tale has fulfilled and outlived its purpose.The saga began on June 26, 2020, when The New York Times announced that unnamed xe2x80x9cAmerican intelligence officialsxe2x80x9d have concluded that xe2x80x9ca Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan xe2x80x94 including targeting American troops.xe2x80x9d The paper called it xe2x80x9ca significant and provocative escalationxe2x80x9d by Russia. Though no evidence was ever presented to support the CIA's claims xe2x80x94 neither in that original story nor in any reporting since xe2x80x94 most U.S. media outlets blindly believed it and spent weeks if not longer treating it as proven, highly significant truth. Leading politicians from both parties similarly used this emotional storyline to advance multiple agendas.The story appeared xe2x80x94 coincidentally or otherwise xe2x80x94  just weeks after President Trump announced his plan to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2020. Pro-war members of Congress from both parties and liberal hawks in corporate media spent weeks weaponizing this story to accuse Trump of appeasing Putin by leaving Afghanistan and being too scared to punish the Kremlin. Cable outlets and the op-ed pages of The New York Times and Washington Post endlessly discussed the grave implications of this Russian treachery and debated which severe retaliation was needed. xe2x80x9cThis is as bad as it gets,xe2x80x9d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then-candidate Joe Biden said Trump's refusal to punish Russia and his casting doubt on the truth of the story was more proof that Trump's xe2x80x9centire presidency has been a gift to Putin,xe2x80x9d while Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) demanded that, in response, the U.S. put Russians and Afghans xe2x80x9cin body bags.xe2x80x9d What was missing from this media orgy of indignation and militaristic demands for retaliation was an iota of questioning of whether the story was, in fact, true. All they had was an anonymous leak from xe2x80x9cintelligence officialsxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 which The New York Times on Thursday admitted came from the CIA xe2x80x94 but that was all they needed. That is because the vast majority of the corporate sector of the press lives under one overarching rule: When the CIA or related security state agencies tell American journalists to believe something, we obey unquestioningly, and as a result, whatever assertions are spread by these agencies, no matter how bereft of evidence or shielded by accountability-free anonymity, they instantly transform, in our government-worshipping worldview, into a proven fact xe2x80x94 gospel xe2x80x94 never to be questioned but only affirmed and then repeated and spread as far and wide as possible.That has been the dynamic driving the relationship between the corporate press and the CIA for decades, throughout the Cold War and then into the post-9/11 War on Terror and invasion of Iraq. But it has become so much more extreme in the Trump era. As the CIA became one of the leading anti-Trump #Resistance factions xe2x80x94 a key player in domestic politics to subvert the presidency of the 45th President regarded by media figures as a Hitler-type menace xe2x80x94 the bond between the corporate press and the intelligence community deepened more than ever. It is not an exaggeration to call it a merger: so much so that a parade of former security state officials from the CIA, NSA, FBI, DHS and others was hired by these news outlets to deliver the news. The partnership was no longer clandestine but official, out in the open, and proud.Matt Taibbi @mtaibbiApril 16th 2021Matt Taibbi @mtaibbiApril 16th 2021The first goal this story served was to weaponize it in the battle waged by pro-war House Democrats and their neocon GOP allies to stop Trump's withdrawal plan from Afghanistan. How, they began demanding upon publication of the CIA/NYT story, can we possibly leave Afghanistan when the Russians are trying to kill our troops? Would that not be a reckless abdication to the Kremlin of this country that we own, and would withdrawal not be a reward to Putin after we learned he was engaged in such dastardly plotting to kill our sons and daughters?In late June, this alliance of pro-war House Democrats xe2x80x94 funded overwhelmingly by military contractors xe2x80x94 and the Liz-Cheney-led neocon wing announced amendments to the military budget authorization process that would defund Trump's efforts to withdraw troops from either Afghanistan or Germany (where they had been stationed for decades to defend Western Europe against a country, the Soviet Union, that ceased to exist decades ago). They instantly weaponized the NYT/CIA story as their primary argument. The record-breaking $740 billion military budget was scheduled to be approved by the House Armed Services Committee in early July. In a joint statement with Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) on June 29 xe2x80x94 the day the NYT story appeared xe2x80x94 Liz Cheney proclaimed that xe2x80x9cwe remain concerned about Russian activity in Afghanistan, including reports that they have targeted U.S. forces.xe2x80x9d One of the Democratsxe2x80x99 most pro-war House members, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), announced on July 1 (three days after the NYT story) his own amendment to block any troop withdrawal from Germany, citing xe2x80x9cincreasing Russian aggression.xe2x80x9d On July 1 and 2, the House Armed Services Committee held its hearings and votes xe2x80x94 I watched all fourteen hours and reported on it in a series of articles and a 90-minute video report xe2x80x94 and it not only approved this massive military budget but also both amendments to bar troop withdrawal. Over and over, the union of pro-war Democrats and Cheney-led neocon Republicans steamrolled the anti-war faction of left-wing and right-wing war opponents (led by Congressmembers Ro Khanna (D-CA), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Matt Gaetz (R-FL)), and repeatedly used the Russia bounty story to justify continuation of the longest war in America's history. This little speech from Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) was illustrative of how this CIA story was used all day:The U.S. media was somehow more militaristic and blindly trusting about this CIA story than even this pro-war union of lawmakers. That the CIAxe2x80x99s leaked claim to The New York Times should even be questioned at all xe2x80x94 given that it was leaked anonymously and was accompanied by exactly zero evidence xe2x80x94 is not something that even crossed their journalistic minds. These people who call themselves xe2x80x9cjournalistsxe2x80x9d do not view pronouncements from the U.S. security state as something that prompts skepticism let alone requires evidence before believing. The officials who run those agencies are their friends, partners and colleagues xe2x80x94 those they most revere xe2x80x94 and their every utterance is treated as Gospel. If xe2x80x94 after watching them behave this way the last five years without pause xe2x80x94 you think that is an exaggeration, watch this short video compilation produced by The Daily Caller to see for yourself how they instantly converted this CIA \"Russia bountyxe2x80x9d leak into proven fact that nobody, least of all them, should question:As usual, the media figure most loudly and dramatically enshrining the CIA leak about Russia as Proven Truth was the undisputed Queen of demented conspiracy theories, jingoistic rhetoric, and CIA propaganda: MSNBCxe2x80x99s Rachel Maddow. Over and over, she devoted melodramatic segments to denouncing the unparalleled evil of Russian treachery in Afghanistan (because the U.S. would never pay bounties to kill Russian soldiers in Afghanistan), at no point pausing her histrionics for even a second or two to wonder whether evidence ought to be presented before telling the millions of #Resistance liberals who watch her show that she is vouching for the truth of this story.Predictably, now that this CIA tale has served its purpose (namely, preventing Trump from leaving Afghanistan), and now that its enduring effects are impeding the Biden administration (which wants to leave Afghanistan and so needs to get rid of this story), the U.S. Government is now admitting that xe2x80x94 surprise! xe2x80x94 they had no convincing evidence for this story all along. The Daily Beast on Thursday was the first to notice that xe2x80x9cthe Biden administration announced that U.S. intelligence only had xe2x80x98low to moderatexe2x80x99 confidence in the story after all.xe2x80x9d The outlet added: xe2x80x9cthat means the intelligence agencies have found the story is, at best, unprovenxe2x80x94and possibly untrue.xe2x80x9d The Guardian also reported that xe2x80x9cUS intelligence agencies have only xe2x80x98low to moderate confidencexe2x80x99 in reports last year that Russian spies were offering Taliban militants in Afghanistan bounties for killing US soldiers.xe2x80x9d NBC News went even further, citing Bidenxe2x80x99s campaign attacks on Trump for failing to punish Putin for these bounties, and noting: xe2x80x9cSuch a definitive statement was questionable even thenxe2x80xa6.They still have not found any evidence, a senior defense official said Thursday.xe2x80x9dWhat made this admission particularly bizarre xe2x80x94 aside from rendering weeks of decrees from media figures and politicians humiliatingly reckless and baseless xe2x80x94 is that the Biden administration continued to assert this claim as truth as recently as Thursday. When announcing new sanctions aimed at Moscow and diplomatic expulsions of Russian diplomats xe2x80x94 primarily in response to allegations of Russian hacking xe2x80x94 the White House said xe2x80x9cit was responding to reports that Russia encouraged Taliban fighters to injure or kill coalition forces in Afghanistan.xe2x80x9d The official White House announcement of the retaliation said explicitly that xe2x80x9cthe Administration is responding to the reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Afghanistan based on the best assessments from the Intelligence Community (IC)xe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 a claim for which the IC itself admits it has only xe2x80x9clow to moderate confidencexe2x80x9d is even true. When asked about this glaring contradiction yesterday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki gave an answer that barely rose to the level of cogency, yet she clearly admitted the lack of evidentiary basis for this long-standing CIA/media tale:  That there is no evidence for this media-laundered CIA story is not something we learned only yesterday. It has been obvious for many months. In September, NBC News  xe2x80x94 as Maddow was in the midst of her performative sadness and indignation over the story on its cable network xe2x80x94 noted:Two months after top Pentagon officials vowed to get to the bottom of whether the Russian government bribed the Taliban to kill American service members, the commander of troops in the region says a detailed review of all available intelligence has not been able to corroborate the existence of such a program.\"It just has not been proved to a level of certainty that satisfies me,\" Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of the U.S. Central Command, told NBC News. McKenzie oversees U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The U.S. continues to hunt for new information on the matter, he said.\"We continue to look for that evidence,\" the general said. \"I just haven't seen it yet.  That was what made the refusal to question this story all along so maddening. Not only was no evidence presented to support the CIAxe2x80x99s assertions xe2x80x94 something that, by itself, should have prevented every real journalist from endorsing its truth xe2x80x94 but commanders in Afghanistan were saying months ago they could not find convincing evidence for it. That is what The Daily Beast meant in Thursdayxe2x80x99s report when it said xe2x80x9cthere were reasons to doubt the story from the startxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 not just the lack of evidence but also that xe2x80x9cthe initial stories emphasize[d] its basis on detainee reportingxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cthe bounties represented a qualitative shift in recent Russian engagements with Afghan insurgents.xe2x80x9d NBC News on Thursday also said that xe2x80x9csuch a definitive statement was questionable even then.xe2x80x9dBut these doubts were virtually non-existent in most media reports. Indeed, one of the New York Times reporters who broke the story publicly attacked me as a conspiracy theorist back in September when I cited that NBC News story about the lack of evidence while pointing out what a crucial role this uncorroborated story played in stopping troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and claiming Trump was beholden to Putin. And while The Daily Beast on Thursday said there were reasons to doubt the story from the start, that same outlet was one of the most vocal and aggressive in pushing the story as true:April 15th 2021Even worse, other media outlets xe2x80x94 led by The Washington Post xe2x80x94 purported to have xe2x80x9cindependently confirmedxe2x80x9d the NYT/CIA tale of Russian bounties. Twice in the last year, I have written about this bizarre practice where media outlets purport to xe2x80x9cindependently confirmxe2x80x9d one another's false stories by doing nothing more than going to the same anonymous sources who whisper to them the same things while providing no evidence. Yet they use this phrase xe2x80x9cindependent confirmationxe2x80x9d to purposely imply that they obtained separate evidence corroborating the truth of the original story: June 27th 2020For months, pro-war members of both parties and leading members of the NYT/CNN/MSNBC media axis pushed a story xe2x80x94 an inflammatory, dangerous one xe2x80x94 based on nothing more than the say-so of anonymous CIA operatives. How can anyone do this who knows even the bare minimum about what this agency does and what its function is: to spread disinformation not just to foreign countries but the domestic population as well? It is both mystifying and toxic. But for people who call themselves xe2x80x9cjournalistsxe2x80x9d to repeat, over and over, evidence-free CIA claims, telling those who trust them to believe it, is nothing short of repulsive. If you think that, upon learning yesterday's news, there was any self-reflection on the part of the media figures who spread this, or that they felt chastened about it in any way, you would be very, very wrong. In fact, not only did few if any admit error, but they did exactly the same thing on Thursday about a brand new evidence-free assertion from the U.S. Government concerning Russia: they mindlessly assumed it true and then stated it to millions of people as fact. They are not embarrassed to get caught spreading false CIA propaganda. They see their role, correctly, as doing exactly that.On Thursday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, run by Bidenxe2x80x99s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, issued a short Press Release about its targeting of Russian-Ukrainian political consultant, Konstantin Kilimnik, with new sanctions. One sentence of this press release asserted a claim that the Mueller investigation, after searching for eighteen months, never found: namely, that xe2x80x9cKilimnik provided the Russia intelligence services with sensitive information on polling and campaign strategyxe2x80x9d that he received from then-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.Is it true that Kilimnik passed this polling data to the Kremlin? Maybe. But there is no way for a rational person xe2x80x94 let alone someone calling themselves a xe2x80x9cjournalistxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 to conclude that it is true. Why? Because, like the CIA tale about Russian bounties xe2x80x94 a claim they learned yesterday had no evidence xe2x80x94 this is nothing more than a U.S. Government assertion that lacks any evidence. Do you think journalists learned the lesson that they just had rubbed in their faces hours before about the foolishness of assuming official statements to be true with no evidence? Of course that is a rhetorical question: too many to count instantly proclaimed that this story was true without spending an ounce of mental energy to question if it was or apply any skepticism. Herexe2x80x99s Maddowxe2x80x99s MSNBC comrade showing how this is done:April 15th 2021Do you see what Hayes just did there? It is vital not to lose sight of how irresponsible and destructive this behavior is just because it is now so common. He saw a Press Release from a U.S. Government agency, read an assertion that it contained in one sentence, had no evidence that this assertion was true, but nonetheless xe2x80x9creportedxe2x80x9d it as if it were proven fact to millions of people in a predictably viral tweet. Hayes was far from alone. I cannot count how many employees of corporate media outlets did the same: read the Treasury Department's Press Release and, without pausing for a second, proclaimed it to be true. Indeed, the two MSNBC hosts who follow Hayes's nightly news program explicitly described this evidence-free Press Release as \"confirmationxe2x80x9dxe2x80x94 confirmation!Let's set aside the absurdity of treating this as some shocking revelation even if it were true. Just like the oozing historical ignorance of pretending that there would be something astonishing about Russians paying for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan when the CIA just last week explicitly boasted of having done the same to Russian soldiers in Afghanistan, what is this Treasury Press Release supposed to prove that is so breathtaking and scandalous: that the Kremlin could not possibly have obtained polling data about the U.S. electorate had Manafort not provided it to them? That they never would have known that Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were swing states without an elaborate plot of collusion to learn this from the Trump campaign? But the far more important point is the U.S. media's willingness xe2x80x94 their subservient eagerness xe2x80x94 to obediently treat U.S. government pronouncements as Truth. Just like with the Russia bounty story, where there were ample reasons to doubt it from the start, the same is true of this Treasury Press Release. To begin with, if this were such a smoking gun \"confirmingxe2x80x9d collusion, why did the Mueller investigation after eighteen months of highly aggressive subpoena-driven investigative activity not discover it? Let's express this as clearly as it can be expressed. Any journalist who treats unverified stories from the CIA or other government agencies as true, without needing any evidence or applying any skepticism, is worthless. Actually, they are worse than worthless: they are toxic influences who deserve pure contempt. Every journalist knows that governments lie constantly and that it is a betrayal of their profession to serve as mindless mouthpieces for these security agencies: that is why they will vehemently deny they do this if you confront them with this accusation. They know it is a shameful thing to do.But just look at what they are doing: exactly this. These are not journalists. They are obsequious spokespeople for the CIA and other official authorities. Even when they learn that they deceived millions of people by uncritically repeating a story that the CIA told them was true, they will xe2x80x94 on the very same day that they learn they did this xe2x80x94 do exactly the same thing, this time with a one-paragraph Treasury Department Press Release. These are agents of disinformation: state media. And when they speak, you should listen to them with the knowledge of what they really are, and treat them accordingly.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Glenn, Maddow back at it again weeks later, trying to rehab and double down on Russian bounty story. Dog with a bone. Abetted by NYT attempt to add xe2x80x9cnewxe2x80x9d declassified info. You should do another brushback if not one in the ear. Glenn, I love your commitment to calling out these corrupt pricks, but you are pulling the most important punch in this story.  The national media hasnxe2x80x99t decided to simply shill for the intelligence community for some random and unknowable reason - and you know it.  There is a mutually beneficial corruption partnership that has been formed by the national media, Democratic Party, neocon Republicans who hate Trump, and certain corrupt intelligence officers who either had their power threatened or want to cash in at CNN, or both.  None of the lies that come from xe2x80x9cunnamed intelligence officersxe2x80x9d (former or current) are ever helpful to Trump or harmful to the Democratic Party.  This was all born out of Trump Derangement Syndrome, which is a virus that has spread widely and created a lot of strange bedfellows.No posts","title":"Journalists, Learning They Spread a CIA Fraud About Russia, Instantly Embrace a New One - Glenn Greenwald","url":"https://greenwald.substack.com/p/journalists-learning-they-spread"}

But lately, there have been some surprises in the world of machine learning, surprises that have emerged as wexe2x80x99ve built ever-larger models. Therexe2x80x99s something weird going on, and there may be even more weirdness in store for us as the models get bigger.So Ixe2x80x99ve begun to (naively) extrapolate from those surprises that we may actually stumble across something like an AGI. Maybe even soon. In this post, Ixe2x80x99d like to think aloud on that topic and to invite feedback and pushback from those who work on these projects.A lot of the conversations that are reflected in this post have taken place xe2x80x9con backgroundxe2x80x9d (which in my case means I donxe2x80x99t quote a source, even anonymously, but just use the information in some paraphrased form). So if youxe2x80x99re someone working in this area and want to reach out with more color on anything Ixe2x80x99ve covered in this post, please feel free to reach out via email or Twitter.There are essays that have been written and still could (and should) be written about the varied roles that a possible near-term AGI plays in the secular eschatology of Silicon Valley.The idea that any day now, some team could hit upon an AGI that would be as big a deal for humanity as the discovery of fire (per Google CEO Sundar Pichai), does more behind-the-scenes work in the world than most people suspect. It drives some of what tech people think are important problems to work on, and increasingly the fear that China will get there first is behind some of Googlexe2x80x99s resistance to being regulated or broken up (based on some conversations Ixe2x80x99ve had, plus my own inference).In short, it doesnxe2x80x99t take much imagination to think of ways that an urgent, species-defining race to be the first company or nation to bring an AGI into the world could hide a multitude of capitalist sins. So I think skepticism is warranted, and I have had plenty of it.And for the most part, skepticism has been the rule among those closest to the topic. While tech luminaries like Pichai and Ray Kurzweil may preach the gospel of a soon-coming AGI xe2x80x94 and while the inner circle that runs Google may believe in that gospel (or so Ixe2x80x99ve heard) xe2x80x94 the actual folks tasked with building such a beast have not historically been very optimistic about their own odds.A survey of AI researchers done in 2016 indicates a consensus of something like a 50 percent probability of an AGI in the next 50 years. But 2016 was a long time ago xe2x80x94 another era xe2x80x94 in machine learning years. So long ago, in fact, that a number of the milestones on the list have already been knocked out well ahead of the consensus schedule:Play all Atari games: Consensus said about 10 years from 2016, but DeepMind could do this as of April 2020.Write a high school essay: Not only can GPT-3 as of 2020 write a high school essay better than most high schoolers, but it can actually write a college essay on a level that fools college professors.Go: This was supposed to be well over 10 years out, but depending on how you adjudicate it, this fell in late 2017 with AlphaZero.5km Race in City (robot vs human): Ixe2x80x99m not sure if Boston Dynamicsxe2x80x99 bipedal Atlas robot is quite there yet, but it has to be close. The gating factor on this one is battery tech and energy density, and no so much ML prowess.You can see from the above that lately we are being surprised to the upside xe2x80x94 things are happening faster than expected, and in many cases, the people closest to these projects are surprised at how good the results are.This is all backward from how software normally works xe2x80x94 you can usually double programmer time and cost estimates for meeting a milestone, and even thatxe2x80x99s often optimistic. Software milestones just donxe2x80x99t tend to arrive unexpectedly early, especially not in clusters like this. There is something weird happening.In the past six or so years, across different problem domains (games, language generation, and other areas Ixe2x80x99ve been told about off-the-record), neural networks have exhibited an important property that does not seem well appreciated outside of elite circles at a handful of large companies: when a neural network-based model gets to a certain size, a kind of miracle can occur.Sometimes, when a neural network is scaled past some size threshold (measured in the amount of computing resources and volume of training data), our human assessment of the quality of its output can change in some fundamental ways. A neural net thatxe2x80x99s essentially a toy, with brittle, awkward-feeling output and limited usefulness, can morph into a stunningly capable piece of technology simply by throwing hardware and training data at it.This is true to the point that working with models on the scale of an OpenAI or a DeepMind is a different experience than working with models at smaller scales (or so Ixe2x80x99m told). Itxe2x80x99s not even just the output thatxe2x80x99s different xe2x80x94 the questions, answers, problems, and processes all undergo a shift, and according to one researcher Ixe2x80x99ve spoken with, itxe2x80x99s almost like big models are a different field of study than everything smaller.December 9th 2020In listening to practitioners in different corners of the machine learning (ML) world describe this scale-based phenomenon to me, it almost sounds like theyxe2x80x99re describing a kind of phase transition, like when water goes from a liquid to a gas at a certain temperature. Neural networks in particular seem to have this phase transition ability in a way that other types of machine learning systems do not.That there essentially two xe2x80x9cstatesxe2x80x9d of neural networks (continuing on the analogy of states of matter) xe2x80x94 xe2x80x9cbiggerxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9csmallerxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 is probably under-appreciated because right now, there are only a handful of these large models in existence at a handful of companies big enough to build them. And the circle of people in those companies that are working closely with those models is small.Furthermore, models this size are quite new xe2x80x94 just in the past few years have they even been possible. So wexe2x80x99ve only just now discovered how different the very large networks are from smaller ones that run the exact same code.But before going into more specifics, I want to ask a pair of questions Ixe2x80x99ve recently been asking ML experts, in the hopes of sparking discussion and soliciting feedback from readers:What if therexe2x80x99s a third xe2x80x9cstatexe2x80x9d at an even larger scale that we havenxe2x80x99t reached yet? Or a fourth state, or a fifth?What if one of those states, at some much higher level of scale, is something like an AGI?The feedback Ixe2x80x99ve gotten so far on the above is that there doesnxe2x80x99t seem to be an intuitive reason why the answer to either one would be xe2x80x9cno.xe2x80x9dAs we push model sizes to ever larger levels of scale xe2x80x94 and companies like Google and Facebook are aggressively expanding their models xe2x80x94 it seems not impossible that we could encounter an AGI at the next phase transition, or the one after that.I could try to illustrate this xe2x80x9cphase transitionxe2x80x9d phenomenon in terms of AlphaGo, which managed to jump from the realm of beating amateurs to that of beating pros with just scaling (though more recent versions do have architectural improvements), but where I really want to focus is on large language models (LLMs).In particular, there was a sudden, scaling-induced jump in output quality from GPT-2 to GPT-3 that even people working in LLMs were not quite expecting.GPT-2 was interesting and fun, and could produce prose that seemed pretty great xe2x80x9cfor an AI.xe2x80x9d When it was announced back in February 2019, its makers had to work to cherry-pick some really good output xe2x80x94 nonetheless, the fact that there was good output there for the cherry-picking was a big deal. Still, it was brittle. Its creators wrote:Nevertheless, we have observed various failure modes, such as repetitive text, world modeling failures (e.g. the model sometimes writes about fires happening under water), and unnatural topic switching. Exploring these types of weaknesses of language models is an active area of research in the natural language processing community.Overall, we find that it takes a few tries to get a good sample, with the number of tries depending on how familiar the model is with the context. When prompted with topics that are highly represented in the data (Brexit, Miley Cyrus, Lord of the Rings, and so on), it seems to be capable of generating reasonable samples about 50% of the time. The opposite is also true: on highly technical or esoteric types of content, the model can perform poorly. Fine-tuning offers the potential for even more detailed control over generated samplesxe2x80x94for example, we can fine-tune GPT-2 on the Amazon Reviews dataset and use this to let us write reviews conditioned on things like star rating and category.But when OpenAI announced GPT-3 xe2x80x94 based on the same algorithm, just run on a larger dataset with 10X the parameters and more computing resources xe2x80x94 it was so good that its output can fool college professors. Some of its essays certainly fooled me; I read them as they circulated on Twitter and then later learned they had been written by GPT-3.Indeed, this essay about GPT-3, written by GPT-3, is better than what most undergrads in the US could produce on this topic:July 31st 2020Whatxe2x80x99s wild is that nobody Ixe2x80x99ve talked to seems to really know why GPT-3 is so much better than GPT-2. Therexe2x80x99s a classic AI explainability problem going on here, where experts can theorize and conjecture about whatxe2x80x99s happening inside the model at one scaling regime vs. whatxe2x80x99s happening differently in another, but nobody really has answers.So this subjective jump in output quality is both surprising and unexplained.I recently spent some time poking around at this issue of LLMs and scaling, and specifically reading through a paper on performance scaling of LLMs released by OpenAI a few months before GPT-3 was launched. My goal was to understand not just why this qualitative jump happened, but if it had been measured somehow xe2x80x94 if there was a curve with an inflection point that I could study.It turns out there is no such curve, at least not in this paper. Sure, there are power-law curves that relate different aspects of the model xe2x80x94 scale-related aspects, or parameters related to training and architecture xe2x80x94 to performance quantified as a loss function. But thatxe2x80x99s not quite what Ixe2x80x99m looking for.The loss function is a kind of training target that measures the degree to which the modelxe2x80x99s output falls within an expected range as dictated by the training data. But that is not the same as measuring the degree to which the output corresponds to a humanxe2x80x99s gut feeling that a particular output text xe2x80x9csmellsxe2x80x9d like it was written by a humanxe2x80x94 the relationship between the loss function curve and that latter, more subjective standard of xe2x80x9csmells humanxe2x80x9d has yet to be formally investigated as far as I know.So when you look at the paperxe2x80x99s conclusion, which is that model size, training data size, and compute resources all have a power-law scaling relationship with performance (as quantified by the loss function), that doesnxe2x80x99t quite tell you much about xe2x80x9cperformancexe2x80x9d framed in subjective human standards of xe2x80x9chey, this reads to me like something a person wrote!xe2x80x9dReaders whoxe2x80x99ve been around geek culture for long enough will probably recognize what Ixe2x80x99m referring to as a xe2x80x9cphase transitionxe2x80x9d as something akin to the uncanny valley phenomenon.In aesthetics, the uncanny valley is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an objectxe2x80x99s resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object. The concept suggests that humanoid objects which imperfectly resemble actual human beings provoke uncanny or strangely familiar feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers.[2] xe2x80x9cValleyxe2x80x9d denotes a dip in the human observerxe2x80x99s affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replicaxe2x80x99s human likeness.[3]In fact, I think what Ixe2x80x99m describing probably is the uncanny valley xe2x80x94 at its root is a human perceptual phenomenon that just shows up in different realms well beyond the visual/graphics realm where it was first identified.Source: Wikipedia.There are probably any number of domains xe2x80x94 from games, to language, to driving, to AI research itself xe2x80x94 where if you throw enough resources at a neural network with the appropriate architecture, it passes some inflection point where the output begins to feel human. Or, if xe2x80x9cfeels humanxe2x80x9d isnxe2x80x99t the goal, probably because youxe2x80x99re doing something exotic that humans couldnxe2x80x99t ever really do, then xe2x80x9cfeels godlikexe2x80x9d may be a better way of describing the results of this shift.I wonder if it isnxe2x80x99t also the case that one sufficiently large model could escape from different uncanny valleys in an expanding series of adjacent domains as we throw more computer power and data at it. (AlphaZero is kind of doing this with games.) When the model is large enough, then it feels human for tasks A and B, and maybe even godlike for task C; then a model another 10X bigger adds tasks D through G to its repertoire. Then what if at some point, we run out of tasks model canxe2x80x99t do in an outside-the-uncanny-valley-like way, and just pack it in and declare it an AGI?I have a ton more thoughts on this, but I want to cut this post off here and open the floor for discussion and feedback.Here are some further avenues Ixe2x80x99d like to explore in a future post:Benchmarks: Ixe2x80x99m really interested in the relationship between context length in an LLM like GPT-3, and the subjective xe2x80x9cfeels humanxe2x80x9d quality of the results. Ixe2x80x99m sure therexe2x80x99s something going on there that could probably be quantified, but benchmarking it would involve something rather like a survey xe2x80x94 a kind of crowdsourced Turing Test. More generally, knowing when a model has undergone a phase transition on a particular task will involve some cross-disciplinary work with a field like survey design, at least for tasks where the benchmark is xe2x80x9cfeels human to humans.xe2x80x9dHardware resources vs. architecture: In most computing contexts, you can substitute clever architectural improvements for hardware resources, and vice versa. Ixe2x80x99m sure this holds in ML, where an improvement to the model either unlocks the next level of scaling by removing a bottleneck, or it lets the model get out of an uncanny valley at a smaller resource level.The China Syndrome: Assuming an AGI is possible, it matters which country gets there first. And whether or not an AGI is possible, it matters if our leaders think itxe2x80x99s possible and are making policy on that basis xe2x80x94 especially if fears of China getting there first are factoring in.Self-supervise learning (SSL): Right now, the models Ixe2x80x99ve discussed here all either need humans to label their training data for them or they have a combination of features that makes them more trainable and tractable (discrete, low to moderate dimensionality, low to moderate complexity). This isnxe2x80x99t always going to be the case, though. So itxe2x80x99s worth thinking in more detail about the role SSL might play in the AGI picture.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Why I've grown less skeptical about artificial general intelligence - doxa","url":"https://doxa.substack.com/p/why-ive-grown-less-skeptical-about"}

In fact, I saw Carrxe2x80x99s thread via LeCunxe2x80x99s approving retweet of it.In my own thread in reply, I predicted that Carr would get grief for this, and what the response from the AI ethics crew would be. Former Google AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell was the first to respond according to the exact script Ixe2x80x99d already laid out, but there were others over the course of the weekend.jonstokes.com @jonst0kesMarch 27th 2021The following 48 hours were filled with tweets and subtweets, and tweets-then-deletes, and lengthy explainers. But despite the mounting pressure, Carr didnxe2x80x99t budge xe2x80x94 he didnxe2x80x99t apologize, nor did he retract the thread. I cheered him on from my own account because, despite our many differences, I could see that Carr was both meaningfully correct and as aware of (and appalled by) the tactics being deployed against him as I was.The weekend drama with Kareem Carr is a window into the very heart of the entire AI ethics project. The core question that Carr tried to tackle xe2x80x94 the question of xe2x80x9cwhat does it mean to allege that an algorithm has race or gender bias?xe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 is the one question the AI ethicists are most keen to answer in a very particular way. But their way is at odds with Carrxe2x80x99s way.It is important to understand why Carrxe2x80x99s thread had to be opposed so vigorously, and what work the claims of xe2x80x9calgorithmic biasxe2x80x9d are doing in the discussions around fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning.In short, the xe2x80x9calgorithmic biasxe2x80x9d claims are a key ingredient in a self-licking ice cream cone of doom. Herexe2x80x99s how it works.To understand the opposition to Carrxe2x80x99s thread, we have to talk about Critical Race Theory (CRT). I know... I know... critical race theory (CRT) is the all-purpose right-wing boogeyperson that always gets the blame for everything wrong in the world, but in this case, you really canxe2x80x99t grasp why Carrxe2x80x99s ultimate claim xe2x80x94 that bias problems are xe2x80x9cfixablexe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 riled up a whole section of AI/ML twitter without some context.I think the best compact summary of CRT, at least for my present purposes, comes from one of its most prominent critics in a recent interview:Critical Race Theory is an academic discipline that holds that the United States is a nation founded on white supremacy and oppression, and that these forces are still at the root of our society. Critical Race Theorists believe that American institutions (such as the Constitution and legal system), preach freedom and equality, but are mere xe2x80x9ccamouflagesxe2x80x9d for naked racial domination. They believe that racism is a constant, universal condition: it simply becomes more subtle, sophisticated, and insidious over the course of history. In simple terms, critical race theory reformulates the old Marxist dichotomy of oppressor and oppressed, replacing the class categories of bourgeoisie and proletariat with the identity categories of White and Black. But the basic conclusions are the same: in order to liberate man, society must be fundamentally transformed through moral, economic, and political revolution.Despite the fact that it comes from a detractor, this thumbnail sketch squares with the academic CRT Ixe2x80x99ve read, and more importantly, it accurately sums up the way that this discourse manifests on Twitter. Indeed, I have a hard time imagining a supporter of CRT disagreeing with any of the above (though Ixe2x80x99m always open to being corrected).So in the eyes of CRT, racism is:The most important part of the origin of every (interlocking) system in our society xe2x80x94 government, markets, education, religion, military, etc.Still present and pervasive in all those systems, and indeed it actively structures them.Not possible to separate from any of those systems while leaving them intact in anything like their present form. A complete overhaul of all the interlocking parts is needed.The above framework applies not just to CRT, but to critical theories generically xe2x80x94 you just swap out (or complement) xe2x80x9cracismxe2x80x9d with other -isms, -phobias, and prefixed flavors of patriarchy.That last point xe2x80x94 that you canxe2x80x99t just separate out a problematic -ism from systems and institutions, and fix it in isolation, leaving everything else intact xe2x80x94 is key, because itxe2x80x99s at the root of the objections to Carrxe2x80x99s claim that bias in AI is xe2x80x9cfixable.xe2x80x9dOne of the reasons the three-part critical theory framework above is so pervasive in different fields and disciplines, is that it provides a universal template for producing arguments, papers, conference speeches, and other artifacts of scholarship in any area.In short, critical theory is a recipe for turning any professional or scholarly domain into a self-licking ice cream cone, where the goal is to keep everyone busy with pursuing a goal that can never be reached.The recipe for producing critical theory work is as follows:Take as a starting point that we all agree on some flavor of the three fundamentals of critical theory I laid out above.Explain, ideally via some novel set of connections or moves that no one has seen before, how racism (or sexism, or cissexism, or cisheteropatriarchy, etc.) actively structures your object of study.Call for the object of study to be xe2x80x9cdismantledxe2x80x9d or otherwise completely reimagined, and rebuilt in some ism-free fashion so that it no longer perpetuates harm.Optional: Give some concrete, detailed ideas for what should replace the thing you called for the reform (or even abolition) of in the previous step.Again, that third step is the most important xe2x80x94 a xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d critical theory product (i.e., a paper, a Twitter thread, video, etc.) is one that systematically and convincingly removes any possibility of a targeted, in-situ fix for the object of criticism, leaving either total overhaul or outright abolition as the only way forward.(Itxe2x80x99s actually the case that in the news mediaxe2x80x99s output, that third, activist step is typically omitted. The reportxe2x80x99s job is done when they point out how hopelessly broken the system is, and they leave the calls for reform or abolition to others.)Anything that smacks of incrementalism or technocratic tweaking will be rejected. The object of criticism must be dismantled with all haste xe2x80x94 not patched and left in production, but pulled offline entirely and rebuilt. To suggest otherwise is to be complicit in the harm the object is causing.You can do this sort of work with everything from British gardening, to prairie dresses, to the Snyder Cut, to early American history, to machine learning. The algorithm works with any object, and if youxe2x80x99re really good at producing novel scholarly artifacts with this mechanism, then you can make a career out of it.Here's an example of the recipe at work in a recent paper, Towards decolonising computational sciences.Secondly, we explain how centering individual people, as opposed to tackling systemic obstacles, is a myopic modus operandi and indeed part of the way the current hegemony maintains itself. Fundamental change is only possible by promoting work that dismantles structural inequalities and erodes systemic power asymmetries...Computational and cognitive sciences xe2x80x94 fields that both rely on computational methods to carry out research as well as engage in research of computation itself xe2x80x94 are built on a foundation of racism, sexism, colonialism, Anglo- and Euro-centrism, white supremacy, and all intersections thereof (Crenshaw 1990; Lugones 2016). This is dramatically apparent when one examines the history of fields such as genetics, statistics, psychology, etc., which were historic- ally engaged in refining and enacting eugenics...The system itself needs to be rethought xe2x80x94 scholars should not, as a norm, need to form grassroots initiatives to instigate retractions and clean up the literature. Rather, the onus should fall on those pro- ducing, editing, reviewing, and funding (pseudo)scientific work. Strict and clear peer review guidelines, for example, provide a means to filter racist pseudoscience out (Boyd, Lindo, Weeks, & McLemore 2020). Ultimately, it is the peer review and publishing system, and the broader academic ecosystem that need to be re-examined and reimagined in a manner that explicitly excludes harmful pseudoscience and subtly repackaged white supremacist from its model...Individual level issues such as interpersonal displays of racism are not the cause but a side-effect, symptomatic of a much deeper problem: structural, systemic, social, and insti- tutional racism and sexism xe2x80x94 ideals and values set in place purposefully a couple of centuries ago (Saini 2019).I couldxe2x80x99ve just quoted the whole paper xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s all along these lines on every page.There were two diagrams posted in response to Carrxe2x80x99s thread that illustrate the above beautifully. The first is from a tweet by Deb Raji:This is quite a good diagram of the multi-step process of building and deploying a machine learning model. I really like it. The red labels denote touch points where the humans who perform these steps xe2x80x94 working as they do in a context of privileges, -isms, and -phobias xe2x80x94 can taint the process and the outcome with their biases.Itxe2x80x99s important to be clear on Rajixe2x80x99s goal in presenting this diagram labeled in this way: she is not aiming to highlight sites where this system can or even should be fixed or improved. Rather, the goal is to show that bias is pervasive at every step, with the result that the system in the diagram is not fixable.The only solution is to work backward from those red labels and reform the larger context that causes humans to transmit their biases via these touchpoints.March 27th 2021March 27th 2021To repeat for emphasis: every red-labeled type of bias in that diagram is alleged to be immune to a technical fix (though some mitigations are admitted to be possible). The only way forward is a complete transformation of our society.A related flowchart was posted in reply to Rajixe2x80x99s thread by feminist Paolo Bonomo, interestingly enough as a retweet from where she had originally posted it in the context of the LeCun vs. Gebru fight over this same issue in the summer of 2020.Yet again, the point of this diagram is that there is the possibility of humans introducing their biases at every step, so there can be no technical fix. The bias structures the entire social system in which the technology is embedded, and cannot be eliminated without transforming society.Herexe2x80x99s an important fact about Deb Rajixe2x80x99s diagram that I think Raji and her colleagues understand quite well, but that I think is not so widely appreciated outside the world of machine learning: all of the red-labeled human touchpoints in the top half of the diagram can and will be eliminated by some flavor of self-supervised learning (SSL) in the near future.At some point soon, the only types of xe2x80x9cAI biasxe2x80x9d left for the critical theorists to problematize, will be the two types associated with the model itself: aggregation bias and evaluation bias. Thatxe2x80x99s it. (More on SSL in a future post.)The additional, post-output types of bias identified in that second diagram are all part of the human context in which AI systems are embedded, so theyxe2x80x99ll continue to get attention from critical theorists. But for various reasons Ixe2x80x99ll cover in a moment, this isnxe2x80x99t satisfactory xe2x80x94 the critics want to keep working on xe2x80x9cAIxe2x80x9d proper.In most AI ethics contexts (especially on Twitter), both types of bias in the bottom half of that diagram are collapsed into xe2x80x9calgorithmic biasxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cmodel bias.xe2x80x9d When the claim is made that the algorithms or models themselves are biased, they mean the parts of the diagram labeled xe2x80x9caggregation biasxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cevaluation bias.xe2x80x9dItxe2x80x99s actually refreshing to see this xe2x80x9cmodel biasxe2x80x9d argument broken up into two parts, because normally these things are both conflated and then gestured at, and the people doing the gesturing typically donxe2x80x99t seem to realize theyxe2x80x99re talking about multiple things.I have not Googled either of these terms, so I donxe2x80x99t know the specific backstory on how Raji is using them here, but Ixe2x80x99ve read so many AI ethics papers I know exactly what goes in the boxes those terms are labeling:In the spot labeled aggregation bias, there are alleged biases that go into selecting the model architecture and the training algorithm. This is the math-intensive part that the alpha nerds are paid big money for. (In AI ethics lore, these alpha nerds are white males. In real life, they are indeed mostly males, but in my experience and that of ML people Ixe2x80x99ve interviewed, the dominant identity categories are Asian, white, and Jewish.)Where her diagram has evaluation bias, there are alleged biases that go into the construction of metrics (also a math-heavy enterprise) that are used to determine if the model is performing as intended.I say xe2x80x9calleged biases,xe2x80x9d because this is where all the game-playing and shenanigans happen. This is where it gets good.Go back to our critical theory recipe, zoom in on step 2 (i.e., xe2x80x9cExplain... how racism... actively structures your object of studyxe2x80x9d) to get to Deb Rajixe2x80x99s diagram, then zoom in on that one xe2x80x9cModelxe2x80x9d box in the middle with all the math in it. Youxe2x80x99re now looking at the critical, load-bearing pillar that is supporting the main wing of the AI ethics edifice.That box full of math has a number of properties that make it an ideal object for critical inquiry:Itxe2x80x99s a black box in the classic sense, in that itxe2x80x99s making decisions that the people downstream from it have no insight into or control over.The math inside it is advanced and gate-keepery xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s understood by relatively few, and produced by even fewer. So itxe2x80x99s suspect on that score.The people who make that math all tend to look and act a certain way, at least in the AI ethics mythology. (No one to my knowledge has ever done a survey of the ethnic makeup of elite ML research teams, however. And certainly, no one has done an attitudes survey of them to see if they conform to popular techbro stereotypes. These claims about the makeup of the field are anchored in anecdote and premised on the notion that Asians of all varieties are functionally xe2x80x9cwhitexe2x80x9d in an ML research context.)As I pointed out above, itxe2x80x99ll be the only human-touched box left standing in the realm of ML proper when SSL finally eats the whole field.Now Ixe2x80x99ll walk you through a toy example of the alchemy that lets an AI ethicist turn a bit of math into xe2x80x9cracism.xe2x80x9dHerexe2x80x99s a collection of ten balls of three different colors. Our task is to represent this whole collection as one ball of a single color. What color do we choose?If we average the colors weighted by the number of balls, then the average ball color in this collection is a shade of gray. That lone gray ball, then, becomes representative of the entire collection despite the fact that itxe2x80x99s the only one in the group that looks the way it does.If we select the color thatxe2x80x99s represented in the collection more than any other, then wexe2x80x99ll end up with a white ball standing in for the whole group, despite the fact that the white balls make up just half the group.If those balls were people and the colors were skin colors, then the black people in this group would get erased under either scheme. That is algorithmic bias.Now, I didnxe2x80x99t say xe2x80x9cthat is algorithmic bias, in a nutshell.xe2x80x9d Because therexe2x80x99s no nutshell. This is literally how every single paper, tweet, video, and talk works, just with harder math.If youxe2x80x99re a sane person, you no doubt find it hard to credit my claim that this is all thatxe2x80x99s going on. Nonetheless, it is true. I wrote a whole essay on this, and if you want the technical details you can jump to the appendix. Every example of xe2x80x9calgorithmic biasxe2x80x9d I was able to find reduces to: xe2x80x9cthis model or statistical technique suppressed one set of data points and/or amplified another set,xe2x80x9d where the data points in question map to some human characteristics.For instance, herexe2x80x99s this exact logic at work in a tweet from a Google Brain researcher and professor, but done with curve-fitting math:El Mahdi El Mhamdi - #26011 @L_badikhoMarch 27th 2021Itxe2x80x99s always the same point, everywhere all the time in every paper from every person who writes about this:The math under investigation amplifies one corner of the dataset and/or suppresses another.The corner of the data that got short shrift at the end corresponds to some marginalized identity out in the world.Ergo, the model itself introduces racist bias. QEDYou can do the above work xe2x80x94 i.e., show that a piece of math amplifies/suppresses signals that correspond to human racial categories xe2x80x94 in both of the red-labeled boxes in Deb Rajixe2x80x99s diagram:You can select a model definition that, when paired with a particular dataset thatxe2x80x99s encoded in a particular way, suppresses signals that happen to correspond to minorities in the real world.You can select a set of evaluation methods that either donxe2x80x99t address #1 above or make it worse by motivating you to tweak the model in the wrong direction.There is stats-type math in both of these boxes, and it does that amplification/suppression thing Ixe2x80x99ve been on about for the whole life of this newsletter.All of this results in a situation where every time a researcher sticks a new bit of math in one of these boxes, there is a chance that an implementation engineer will run some human-derived data through it and find that the model is xe2x80x9cbiasingxe2x80x9d the results along race/gender/etc. lines. And whenever this happens, a conference paper can be written about that problem and added to the literature on xe2x80x9calgorithmic bias,xe2x80x9d where it will eventually make its way into tweets, talks, and books about how algorithms themselves can be inherently racist independent of the input data.Ixe2x80x99ve made all the points I want to make about bias, so if youxe2x80x99re tired of reading about this you can skip this section and not miss much. But for completenessxe2x80x99s sake, I want to return to the ball example and break it down in terms the AI ethics people use.Bias in data collection and labeling: The ball collection in my image is my data, and you can see that it has a certain makeup that directly lends itself to the problems Ixe2x80x99m having compressing it or otherwise representing it in a way thatxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cfair.xe2x80x9d If the balls were colored differently, or there was a different number, the outcome would be different.Bias in the problem statement: I characterized the task as xe2x80x9crepresent the whole collection as one ball of a single color.xe2x80x9d The way the task is framed means Ixe2x80x99m definitely going to erase one or more colors, no matter what my data looks like. Maybe my results would be more equitable if the task where, say, xe2x80x9crepresent the collection as a ball filled in by a gradient.xe2x80x9dBias in the algorithm: My approach of using either the most common color or a weighted average of colors doomed me to erase the black balls in the output.Bias in evaluation: What if Ixe2x80x99m looking at the results with my diversity, equity, and inclusion hat on? With that hat on, I believe the collection would be best represented by a ball color that has historically been underrepresented. Itxe2x80x99s important that we redress this historical inequity, so if the algorithm is producing white and gray balls, then I have to keep sending it back for tweaking until it shows me a black ball.You can easily imagine how I could go on doing this with this toy ball problem. I could probably squeeze another six or seven types of bias out of it. So it shouldnxe2x80x99t be hard to envision how a group of highly educated and motivated people could mine a complex, math-heavy, fast-moving field like machine learning for an endless amount of this type of material.This is especially true if youxe2x80x99re not in any way constrained by a requirement that you propose a technical fix for any problems you identify. Because the problems are unfixable, and indeed proposing a fix is anathema, the only constraint on the production of critical theory artifacts are institutional xe2x80x94 how many papers can we publish and talk about, how many jobs are there for doing this work, who can I get to notice and signal boost the problematizing Ixe2x80x99m doing, and so on.Anyone who has followed my Twitter feed or this newsletter knows Ixe2x80x99m in the camp that believes AI/ML has real problems, and real potential for widespread harm. The AI ethics folks have at times pointed out real issues that demand urgent attention, and I credit them with bringing these things to light in a way that has caused many of us to begin focusing on them. I certainly would not be aware of or interested in these issues if it werenxe2x80x99t for their work. But where I part company with them is the same place Kareem Carr does xe2x80x94 with xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s fixable.xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99m in the xe2x80x9cmend it, donxe2x80x99t end itxe2x80x9d camp, and I think the way forward is to continue to work on mitigations, fixes, and tweaks to the system we have.March 28th 2021One of the fixes that will have to be deployed if wexe2x80x99re to make progress, is to dismantle the self-licking ice cream cone. Whatxe2x80x99s needed is a counter-revolution in AI/ML xe2x80x94 some kind of fairness, accountability, and transparency ML (FATML) caucus thatxe2x80x99s dedicated to making things better, and that values rigor, fairness, and civility.This will require people within AI/ML who are willing to openly confront the existing FATML clique, and argue with them about both substance and style. Because leaving the problem of fixing ML to revolutionaries whose project is to put the goalposts so far down the field that they can continue playing the game indefinitely is a recipe for rolling catastrophe.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I find this article extra disappointing because you're consistently so close. I'll work through this with a concrete example, because I think that makes things simpler.You seem to agree with 1-4 from your society has problems tweet, yet you seem to take issue with people suggesting that the solutions to those problems can't be entirely technical, and that in some cases the cost of perpetuating society's problems today may be greater than the value gained from automating them.Say we propose to replace cash bail with a risk model, as California recently voted on. There are lots of possible models one could propose. Trivially, you could hold everyone, or let everyone free. Both of those present statistical bias: the model will misclassify some people. But does the model have any racial bias? Well a model that lets everyone free arguably does not (and you're free to argue this, please do!), but a model that holds everyone perpetuates any existing biases in the police force, so if for a particular group is more likely to be arrested even if they aren't more likely to commit crime, they'll be held in jail more than they should be. A statistical *and* racial bias.But note that if the police force isn't racially biased to begin with, the (naive, but still) statistically biased algorithm won't make things worse.But we don't use those naive algorithms, we use complex ML models. And in those cases, they can encode additional bias not solely present in the initial data. Other people and papers explain this far better than I can, but imagine you overpolice a specific group, the data will show that they're more likely to commit crime. If you train a model on that data, you now have the police arresting people more, and the model holding more of those people, a double dip of racial bias, despite only a single-dip of statistical bias.So we both start from the assumption that \"society has problems\", then one possible goal is to reduce the statistical bias as close to zero as possible. This, at best, makes things no worse than they are. But even a perfectly statistically unbiased algorithm may increase inequality, if for example its use makes some pre-existing socially biased system more efficient. So the question then is \"what are you mending?\" Reducing statistical bias is usually, probably, a good thing. But not always: sometimes intentional biases in a system reduce inequality although this can be controversial along multiple axes. For a non-ML example, consider voting districts gerrymandered to be majority-minority so that minorities would have some representation. This requires thinking about intended outcomes: should congress (or the bag of marbles) represent the mean citizen or the median? Which is more important: geographic or racial representation? \"Better data\" or \"better algorithms\" won't solve those problems. And naively applying ML, even \"unbiased\" ML may exacerbate those problems. You can similarly see this issue in debates around algorithmic approaches to redistricting, and how those may result in less-representative districts in some cases, even if they do reduce partisan gerrymandering.Further, you seem to take serious issue with many of the ethicists, framing them as rather radical for saying that we should be cautious about how we approach using ML and similar tools. But their position is a fundamentally conservative one. If, right now, at this very moment, ML isn't being used somewhere, it is more radical to add some sort of ML than to change nothing.Here, you claim that the ethicists don't propose solutions beyond toppling the whole system (where the whole system may not just mean ML, but all of society or something). But that isn't true. In googles-colosseum, you acknowledge that there's another solution they propose: intentionally modifying the data (or the model) to better represent the way the world \"should\" be. You claim that this is a non-starter for Google, but it isn't. They absolutely do it in some cases already. Perhaps it isn't possible in all cases, for technical reasons, but then the question of \"should we introduce a system that perpetuates inequality that we all agree is there\" is a really important one! Maybe the value is still worth it, but maybe it isn't, so we should ask the question (and some of the work of the ethicists you criticize is frameworks for addressing similar questions).On twitter, you also seemed to have a personal aversion to the \"Separation\" approach. If I understood your argument correctly, it was that since we can't all agree on the way we want the world to be, the best approach is to not try to influence things, and just have the models do what they do (https://twitter.com/jonst0kes/status/1374827973677834246).There's a number of problems with this though. First of all, someone's gonna need to make choices that impact the system. Something as simple as the L1 vs. L2 norm can affect how a model perpetuates inequality. So ultimately it isn't HRC vs. SBC, it's HRC or SBC or the Google engineers building the model. Someone is evaluating its performance. You can't escape that.And you might say that your response, that the Google engineers don't represent \"activists with a niche, minority viewpoint\", which might be true. But that doesn't mean that the model represents the linguistic status quo. Just the opposite in many cases: there's lots of cargo-culting of various meta-parameters (e.g. lists of topics or words that should be excluded when building the model) that perpetuate inequality (and statistical bias). Even if you consider that good work, and it's only a subset of the work by the activists that's objectionable, it's still not clear that what you'll end up with. Are you really sure that a model built by a company with the ultimate goal of being profit-driven will be better for you representative than one who aim for it to be socially responsible? Also, I think you almost stumble on one of the major criticisms of LLMs but carefully avoid it: what if you could have both the HRC and the SBC model, and could pick between them? Then the issue is entirely political: you convincing Google which one to use (or offering both). As is, it's cost prohibitive to build bothBack to the main point: the thesis of many of the ethicists is that technical fixes to a model won't fix everything. That's very different than how you represent them, which appears to be that they are anti-technical fixes. Beyond that, you claim that they offer no solutions. This is half true: they are careful to say that there's no silver bullet. But they do offer tools to improve things, both technical and organizational/social/procedural. You seem to reject many of those non-technical tools, not because they're fundamentally, but because of personal aversions to the politics of the people offering them. But framing them as radical end-its, when they're ultimately conservative-in-how-we-apply-and-use-these-tools people who propose solutions you're personally averse to seems profoundly unfair.There's also a meta-conversation that continued focus on only the technical fixes is counterproductive to solving the (again: real problem that we all agree on) that ML will amplify inequality in some cases.

Therexe2x80x99s some discussion of that approach in this paper, which Ixe2x80x99ve yet to fully finish.However, the point I raised in the newsletter about how itxe2x80x99s cost-prohibitive to have an LLM that works on only one subdomain still applies. No one can afford to spend what it takes to train and run an LLM, only to narrow the modelxe2x80x99s focus to serve a specific community.It does strike me, though, that fine-tuning may provide an avenue for the kinds of activist tweaking and agenda-driven meddling I worried about in the Twitter threads linked at the end of that newsletter. Ixe2x80x99ll need to drill down deeper on this, though.Finally, there has been some work done on the problem of gender and machine translation. Here are a few examples Ixe2x80x99m aware of:Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Mitigating Gender Stereotypes in Languages with Rich MorphologyPredictive Biases in Natural Language Processing Models: A Conceptual Framework and OverviewReducing Gender Bias in Neural Machine Translation as a Domain Adaptation ProblemDecoding and Diversity in Machine TranslationYouxe2x80x99ll notice that all four of these papers are from 2019 and 2020. Natural language processing (NLP) systems have only recently gotten as good as they now are, and good technical work on many of these linguistic bias and identity issues is just getting started in earnest.If you have other examples of technical papers where people are working on solutions for these issues, please drop them in the comments.This really thoughtful essay, Fair ML Tools Require Problematic ML Models, did not come my way directly as a result of my MT post, but it does touch on some of the same themes of bias and toxicity in language models.What I really like about Jacob Buckmanxe2x80x99s piece is that it introduces a concept I had not considered for thinking through the problems of identity, community, and toxicity in language models. Specifically, Buckman lays out the chatbot case for what is essentially the LLM version of an immune system, arguing that a chatbot system cannot fight off toxic language without actively seeking out firsthand knowledge of such language and incorporating that knowledge into its model.If you go to build a chatbot on top of an LLM where the LLMxe2x80x99s training data has been sanitized of anything and everything bad, then you will:Fail at this, because language evolves, so xe2x80x9ctoxicxe2x80x9d is a moving target, andProduce a chatbot with no knowledge of toxicity, and therefore no way to filter such out to suit changes in context.Herexe2x80x99s how Buckman puts it:We canxe2x80x99t hard-code everything. Language is too broad in its scope, and cultural norms too subtle and varied to police effectively. (Not to mention that they change over time!) The last few years of progress in deep learning provide ample evidence that hand-engineering is terribly limited in its usefulness, and that language is best approached in a data-driven way. The only real solution is for our chatbot to have access to a strong model of harmful language, so it can identify why that description would be inappropriate, and avoid causing this harm.All the approaches to this issue that Ixe2x80x99ve seen so far involve sanitizing either the inputs or the outputs, or complaining about bias effects in the model and hand-waving about how the identity characteristics of the model-makers are somehow to blame for that. So as far as I know, this is a novel idea and one I really like.Probably the main place where Buckmanxe2x80x99s essay intersects with my post from yesterday is where he insists that the LLMs arenxe2x80x99t themselves toxic xe2x80x94 theyxe2x80x99re just reproducing (and in some cases, amplifying) patterns that are in the training data xe2x80x94 but rather itxe2x80x99s specific uses of their output that are toxic.In other words, the problem of building a non-toxic chatbot should be separated out from the problem of building an LLM. The LLM needs deep and broad exposure to all aspects of language, both the good and the bad, whereas itxe2x80x99s the chatbot makerxe2x80x99s responsibility to see that the bad parts arenxe2x80x99t exposed to the end-user (i.e. by using the LLMxe2x80x99s knowledge of both good and bad to do filtering).This is similar to a point I raised about MT: right now, itxe2x80x99s properly the userxe2x80x99s responsibility to sanitize and otherwise correct an MT toolxe2x80x99s output. If youxe2x80x99re just publishing the raw output of MT for human consumption, then youxe2x80x99re probably not using the tool responsibly.Despite all the caveats and concessions in yesterdayxe2x80x99s post around this issue of blame, I do still hold to the idea that toxicity and bias problems in MT are currently the responsibility of the toolxe2x80x99s users, even in cases where MT is being used in place of an actual translator. If people use high-tech tools in production, then they need to be aware of their limitations and take measures to mitigate them. Maybe this means placing appropriate warnings on the machine-generated translations that are published, or otherwise positioning them for consumption.At the point when itxe2x80x99s possible to correct these issues in production, then if a model builder doesnxe2x80x99t correct them, they are at fault. Until then, the parties that deploy these tools need to give some guidance on interpreting the output.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Some followups on the politics of machine translation - doxa","url":"https://doxa.substack.com/p/some-followups-on-the-politics-of"}

Or, at least, thatxe2x80x99s the claim made in the following, viral tweet:March 20th 2021Before you jump to defend Google Translate by pointing out that this example is contrived, someone tried a much less contrived example and it still mangled it in the exact same way:March 21st 2021As Felix Salmon pointed out in a reply to my thread on this tweet, and I certainly agree with him, if a human translator produced the above, wexe2x80x99d say that translator was sexist.March 21st 2021I kept thinking about Felixxe2x80x99s point after our exchange, and one question still nagged at me: What does it mean to say that a machine translation (MT) model is xe2x80x9csexistxe2x80x9d?As I thought about this question, I unpacked it into a collection of further questions, which Ixe2x80x99ll present below in the form of a dialogue.We join the dialogue in-progress, our participants having already begun to discuss the question of what it means to call Google Translate xe2x80x9csexist.xe2x80x9dSocrates: Wouldnxe2x80x99t calling an MT model xe2x80x9csexistxe2x80x9d mean that the modelxe2x80x99s training has encoded a bunch of sexist patterns in it, patterns that itxe2x80x99s then reproducing in the world via language?Timaeus: Perhaps this is so, Socrates. And if it is indeed so, then is that also what it means for a human (brain) to be sexist? (I.e. that the person was xe2x80x9ctrainedxe2x80x9d on sexist inputs, and reproduces those patterns in the world?)Critias: Certainly neither of you has the right of it, friends. For the model is simply a tool xe2x80x94 like a turbocharged dictionary xe2x80x94 and not a person against whom one can bring a charge of xe2x80x9csexismxe2x80x9d. Google Translate is a translation aide, not a translator. A human must take its output and further edit it to suit his audience. Thus the blame for any sexism in the resulting translation is on the human user of this tool, and not on the tool, itself.Timaeus: But surely itxe2x80x99s possible, dear Critias, to say that a simple tool, like a dictionary, is objectively xe2x80x9csexistxe2x80x9d if it contains sexist language. It follows, then, that we can call a tool xe2x80x9csexistxe2x80x9d because its makers are sexist. But regardless of whether we describe the tool itself as xe2x80x9csexist,xe2x80x9d I think youxe2x80x99re correct to turn our attention to the matter of who is to blame. Indeed, I believe the real question we should all consider is: who do we blame for the translation toolxe2x80x99s sexism?Socrates: Well said, Timaeus! In the case of a dictionary, we blame the authors. In the case of Google Translate, perhaps we should therefore blame Google. Might we conclude it is Google that is sexist, for they have produced a sexist xe2x80x9cdictionaryxe2x80x9d (of sorts)?Hermocrates: Certainly not, Socrates. Google is surely not to blame for producing a xe2x80x9cdictionaryxe2x80x9d (as you say) that merely reflects the sexism found in everyday speech.Is it not the responsibility of a dictionary (and a dictionaryxe2x80x99s authors!) to faithfully represent the language as it is, and not as they wish it to be? Itxe2x80x99s no fault of Googlexe2x80x99s if our language is sexist, nor is it the fault of their model, but rather the fault lies with the interlocking systems of domination and oppression that structure the social context in which translation, itself an exercise of power...Socrates: Slow your roll, Woke-ocrates! Before you lead us down that particular rabbit hole, Ixe2x80x99d like to introduce a fact we have not yet considered: machine translation is increasingly being used in certain technical and bureaucratic applications as a replacement for a human translator. So it is not always acting not merely as a tool or translation aid, but in many cases, it acts as a standalone translator in its own right.How then, are we to assign blame for the things our machines do in the world when they act xe2x80x94 much as we do xe2x80x94 out of a combination of past training, present prompts, and some expectations about the future? Is the blame with the parent, or with the child, or with the educational system, or with society?Critias: If we allow our conversation to take this turn, Socrates xe2x80x94 if we begin to consider the machine acting in the place of a human translatorxe2x80x94 then what of the recent debate around the Dutch translation of Amanda Gormanxe2x80x99s inaugural poem? A machine cannot be black, or female, and so on. So if we hold the machine to the same standard as Gormanxe2x80x99s Dutch translators insist on, we could never produce a machine translation!Socrates: Then let us by no means hold to that standard, Critias. For if we did, then how would a future generation understand our own words after wexe2x80x99re long dead? How would some person thousands of years from now join this very conversation from across the ages?It was at this point that I realized I had entered into the realm of the general philosophy and politics of translation. I spent years of my life (about ten) in graduate school, translating ancient texts (mostly Greek literature, but some Hebrew and a tiny bit of Aramaic), but I needed to call for backup. I needed professional help.So I reached out to Art Goldhammer and asked him to help me think through some of these issues on a Zoom call. He graciously agreed, and the results were incredibly helpful. Our conversation helped me get unstuck in some important ways, and I hope it helps others, as well.Art and I know each other from the Internet, and it has been my pleasure to correspond with him periodically over the years on a variety of topics of mutual interest. His translation of Pikettyxe2x80x99s Capital in the Twenty-First Century sits beside my reading chair, and most of what little I know about current European politics comes via him in some form or other.Artxe2x80x99s official title is Senior Affiliate at the Center for European Studies at Harvard University. Hexe2x80x99s been a professional translator since 1977, and hexe2x80x99s also a writer. As a professional translator, Art works with French and English, and has translated over 125 books in his career.As an undergraduate at MIT in the 1960xe2x80x99s, Art worked on an early program for doing circuit design that was later used in an Apollo mission. He got his start coding on an 50xe2x80x99s-era IBM 650, and today he stays current with modern web apps. (He and I have had occasion to correspond about things like GraphQL and React.) So in addition to being a translator, he has legit OG geek cred.What follows is an edited transcript of most of the first half of our conversation, which is available in its entirety on YouTube:I started off by asking for Artxe2x80x99s general thoughts on the responsibility of the translator, and what he thought about the whole controversy around Amanda Gormanxe2x80x99s Dutch translation.Art: The responsibility of the translator, in my view, is to represent faithfully what the authorxe2x80x99s intention is. To do that, I donxe2x80x99t think that a translator needs to share an identity with the person being translated xe2x80x94 however one wants to define xe2x80x9cidentity.xe2x80x9dIn my career, Ixe2x80x99ve translated more than 125 books from a range of disciplines, many of them in history, or the social sciences, or economics xe2x80x94 you read the Piketty book, which was probably the most widely read of all the books Ixe2x80x99ve translated.Now, what qualifies me to translate in so many different disciplines? Ixe2x80x99m not sure that anything does except intense study. Before I sit down to translate a book, I read widely in the field from which itxe2x80x99s being translated. Many, many years of experience have equipped me to translate in a variety of disciplines.Of course, when you begin as a translator, you donxe2x80x99t have that experience, so you have to have some kind of affinity xe2x80x94 some knowledge of the culture from which youxe2x80x99re translating.That knowledge of the culture is acquired in various ways, perhaps by simply studying the language from books, perhaps by living in the country and having conversations with people there, by conversing with people who work in the disciplines, by reading widely from people in the disciplines in which you translate.For a poem, like Amanda Gormanxe2x80x99s, the challenge is different. But simply being of the same race as Amanda Gorman is not necessarily the qualification that one needs. A black person growing up in France would not have the same experiences as a black person growing up in the United States. Black people in the United States come from a variety of different communities, not all of which share experiences.So what are the relevant experiences for a translator? Itxe2x80x99s very hard to say in advance... I think in each case, it has to be made case-by-case. Usually, the author has a say in the selection of the translator, but many authors donxe2x80x99t really have the tools to evaluate the qualifications of the translator.To be frank, publishers donxe2x80x99t necessarily have the tools, either. But the advantage an editor has over an author is that editors who have worked with a number of translators in the past have seen a range of the work of a particular translator, and theyxe2x80x99re perhaps better placed than the author ot make the choice.But the choice is not easy, and I donxe2x80x99t think can be based on a simple definition of identity. What goes into a translation is so much more complex than what we usually mean by identity when wexe2x80x99re talking about political identities.Jon: This is really useful to me, because one of the topics I have on my list is: can a machine really be a translator? This is something that Felix Salmon and I disagree on.My take was, this is a translation aide, like a turbocharged dictionary. Itxe2x80x99s a tool, itxe2x80x99s not an actual translator. A translator is a person. And my reasoning there was various, but part of it was: a machine canxe2x80x99t bear any moral responsibility for the translation.Youxe2x80x99re not gonna say, xe2x80x9cthe machine is sexist.xe2x80x9d You can say maybe the programmers are.I think the other piece of it, which you highlighted, is: if wexe2x80x99re gonna do a thing where the translator has to share a set of identity characteristics with the translatee, then a machine will never qualify in any respect.Art: I think I agree with you entirely that a translator is a person and a machine is a tool that can be used by a person.[Art describes how he uses MT as a translation aide when working in a non-professional capacity with one of the other languages that he knows but isnxe2x80x99t as proficient in as he is in French. Re-emphasizing the point that, for him, MT is a tool, and one that has come a long way since he first started using it.]With respect to the Hungarian text you referred to that was criticized on Twitter for its sexism, I thought that the original text that was submitted was actually a trap laid for the machine. Because it gave a series of sentences that one might expect to elicit a sexist response from a machine tool. And it did as expected.It had a series of sentences where, if you didnxe2x80x99t know the text and were simply translating based on cumulative historical experience of the language, which is what the ML translation tools are based on, youxe2x80x99d obviously come out with that sexist reading.Now I didnxe2x80x99t know about the second example you brought up, where they used gendered pronouns, and the machine continued to be sexist despite having that reference. Thatxe2x80x99s the kind of mistake that a human would not make, but a machine would.Jon: One of the philosophical issues here is that all these machine translation tools are trained on a corpus, so they embody the biases and prejudices and patterns that are in the corpus. And therexe2x80x99s no way for the machine, in the moment xe2x80x94 a least not yet, although there is work being done on this xe2x80x94 to steer the translation with reference to a style [sample] or a fact pattern.So you can have this tool that embodies knowledge about a corpus of texts, but when it comes to doing the actual translation, you canxe2x80x99t steer it except in this very brute-force kind of way.I think Google uses a set of rules to randomize pronouns in some cases. So there are things they can do that are complex, brittle, and rule-based. But itxe2x80x99s almost like spraying vinegar on spoiled meat xe2x80x94 youxe2x80x99re just trying to give it a better odor or mask the fact that therexe2x80x99s something in the corpus that is not working.But, to go back to your opener, you talked about how you read widely in the field. So as a translator, youxe2x80x99re coming to it with this body of knowledge of this corpus. But when it comes to a specific work, youxe2x80x99re trying to pull in the current context xe2x80x94 from whatever area, be it sociology or economics, or whatever.If I frame it in terms of responsibility, then, part of your responsibility as a translator is to represent the language in this area of specialization as itxe2x80x99s currently being used. Is that a fair way to phrase it?Art: Yes, thatxe2x80x99s right. But essentially, thatxe2x80x99s what machine learning is also doing. The machine is trained on a corpus, and itxe2x80x99s trained on corpora in two languages xe2x80x94 the source language, and the target language xe2x80x94 at the same time.Thatxe2x80x99s the same thing a professional translator has to do. When I translate history, I read history in French, and I also read history in English, in a similar subfield of history. Because youxe2x80x99re translating for a community. And the receiving community has its own conventions. And the conventions used by historians working in English are different than the conventions used by historians writing in French.There are certain set phrases that are used to connote a certain relationship to a body of material, or a certain authoritative posture of the scholar writing. And those phrases, if you translated them literally from French, would seem totally out-of-place in English. What you have to find is an equivalent for the French phrase that establishes the same relationship of author to text that the French phrase does.What the human does to establish that equivalence is also what the machine does, which is to read corpora taken from the same context.The problem is that the engineers who set up the machine learning donxe2x80x99t have as clear a definition of these sub-communities that theyxe2x80x99re translating from. Machine Learning might take a French corpus, like all of Wikipedia, and use English Wikipedia as the target text. Thatxe2x80x99s a convenient way of locating an equivalent body of text, but it doesnxe2x80x99t narrow down the communities as a human translator would.A human translator would take a much narrower community xe2x80x94 say, French historians, writing about the French Revolution, and look at texts by English-speaking historians writing about the French Revolution xe2x80x94 to establish those equivalences.I think that might be one direction machine learning engineers might want to go, to think in terms of communities, rather than a more universal corpus of texts.Jon: Yeah, thatxe2x80x99s a great point. Google Translate is one-size-fits-all, and this gets at why it feels to me like a dictionary and not a translator. Because therexe2x80x99s no implied community.But I like this idea that a translation is from one community to another community.I like your point about these idioms that xe2x80x94 I guess in internet-speak wexe2x80x99d call them signaling xe2x80x94 theyxe2x80x99re tribal markers, it sounds like. You use a phrase in a certain way to signal a certain kind of status to the reader, and then youxe2x80x99ve got to map that into the same signal from a different community.Art: Right. Exactly.Jon: I agree with you about the Gorman situation, but then if I think about it in those [community-to-community] terms, Ixe2x80x99m thinking: ok, if wexe2x80x99re going to frame this as community-to-community translation, then what if therexe2x80x99s a community on the other end of the Dutch translation that sees the Gorman poem as xe2x80x9ctheirs.xe2x80x9d And theyxe2x80x99re less concerned with fidelity, or with other kinds of classic translator things, and for them, the identity characteristics of the translator are part of the translation.I donxe2x80x99t know, Ixe2x80x99m being super charitable. I think a lot of this stuff is about food fights and signaling. But Ixe2x80x99m trying to think charitably with this insight you just mentioned. And there are metalinguistic properties, like the color of the translator, that go into this community signaling.This is only the first half of the interview. Therexe2x80x99s a lot more up on YouTube, where we go a little deeper into more general translation issues. I stopped the transcription here, though, because wexe2x80x99ve now covered the main material that Ixe2x80x99ve been subsequently thinking about as it applies to MT.Art said: xe2x80x9cI think that might be one direction machine learning engineers might want to go, to think in terms of communities, rather than more universal corpora of texts.xe2x80x9d This would be ideal, but currently there are two practical barriers to this approach:Training an LLM is expensive, so training one on a niche subfield is out of the question.Even if cost werenxe2x80x99t an issue, you need a really large corpus for the model to capture enough of the language to make it sound fluent. And you probably canxe2x80x99t enough histories of the French Revolution in either language to make that work.At some point, there will be a technical fix that more closely approximates the work that Art describes himself doing when he sets out to translate a text. Specifically, there are two components to Artxe2x80x99s method:Have a lifetime of much exposure to both the source and target languages and cultures, via reading, speaking, and even living among native speakers.Spend time doing focused reading in subcommunities that are related to the text youxe2x80x99re trying to translate, so that you pick up the particular idioms of those communities and can bring them over from the source to the target language.Right now, MT is only doing step 1 xe2x80x94 the wide reading of an entire corpus. There is currently no technical mechanism for doing the more focused reading in step 2.This lack of a way to focus the model so that it translates in a way thatxe2x80x99s more natural to a target community is behind most of the moral and political issues raised in the original tweet and in the dialogue, above.Once we do have a mechanism for conditioning the output of an MT tool to fit a more community-specific reference, this will raise a whole host of new issues and disputes.I have some recent Twitter threads that begin to explore these issues, and I may turn them into newsletter posts in the future:jonstokes.com @jonst0kesMarch 24th 2021jonstokes.com @jonst0kesMarch 24th 2021For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.As far as I'm concerned, Andrew Conner's example reveals a shortcoming of the translator a lot more basic than sexist bias or lack of nuance. The meaning of all pronouns should be entirely unambiguous thanks to the presence of a unique antedecent (\"John\", in the first sentence). Even if Google should somehow believe that \"John\" is a female name, the pronouns would all end up the same. My impression is that the previous, logical (as opposed to statistical) wave of AI would have gotten this one right. Apparently, whatever google is doing is unable to connect words that are more than 2 sentences apart. If this is a general limitation, then we can sleep easy, at least those of us with tech jobs beyond data entry...> Right now, MT is only doing step 1 xe2x80x94 the wide reading of an entire corpus. There is currently no technical mechanism for doing the more focused reading in step 2.\"Fine-tuning\" models on a smaller, more focused dataset definitely exists in other areas of natural-language processing. I wonder why we haven't seen it applied to translation?No posts","title":"The politics of machine translation - doxa","url":"https://doxa.substack.com/p/the-politics-of-machine-translation"}

Ixe2x80x99ve already reached the point where I could keep a staff busy with stories, but this is a solo newsletter (for now) so thatxe2x80x99ll have to wait. In the meantime, until I get a staff, my plan is to regularly give overviews of stories and beats I think are worth looking at in more detail.Today, Ixe2x80x99m looking at the issue of reining in AI via regulation. The regulation of algorithms is an entire reporting beat all to itself, and it has a few main contours that Ixe2x80x99ll try to trace in no particular order:Benchmarking and standards: Before you can regulate, you have to be able to measure. Wexe2x80x99re just now beginning to develop the tools to measure how well datasets and models do or donxe2x80x99t fit some kind of policy ideal. This work is fairly new and ongoing.Difficulty and complexity: This 2016 paper proposing an FDA for algorithms (seen via this post) gives a sense of just how complex an undertaking such a thing would be. Like food and drugs, algorithms take many forms, and theyxe2x80x99re already everywhere, and therexe2x80x99s years of work in just figuring out what youxe2x80x99re even going to regulate, much less how.The insider/outsider problem: One of the biggest barriers to good financial regulation is the fact that the specialists who are in the best position to understand Big Finance (and therefore regulate it) are all insiders with conflicted relationships where a lot of money is at stake. The same is true in machine learning. As I describe in more detail in the next section, leading-edge ML is still a fairly small club, and regulators do not and cannot understand it well enough to rein it in. It will take insiders who, after investing significant time and money in developing their own expertise, are willing to dedicate their precious time to either helping regulators or becoming regulators.AIxe2x80x99s hype problem: AI has been notoriously overhyped in the past, and the general feeling right now even among many who should know better is that itxe2x80x99s still mostly snake oil and not worth worrying about. Everyone who thinks that way is about five years out-of-date, but nonetheless this is a really prevalent attitude. Nobody will get behind a big push to regulate something they take to be a bunch of hype and nonsense.Impact on innovation: The EU is doing some amount of ML regulation, and therexe2x80x99s research- and startup-hindering red tape and committees that Ixe2x80x99ve heard about but need to learn more about. This slows everything down and is not what you want because of the next two points.The race for artificial general intelligence (AGI): We donxe2x80x99t know how close we are to an AGI, or if such a thing is even possible. But if it is real, then finding it may well be one of the most important moments in human history since the discovery of fire. So therexe2x80x99s a ton of pressure to keep pushing as fast as possible and to get there first.The China factor*: The Chinese AI effort doesnxe2x80x99t have a lot of the constraints we have in the West. They can be as invasive as they like in collecting data on their citizens, so there will never be any shortage of training data. Theyxe2x80x99re also really good at building large-scale things, quickly. So if an AGI is reachable simply by throwing transistors and data at an existing neural net architecture, then they will find it.Regulation is a weaker, slower point of control than the private sector. Ixe2x80x99ll unpack this idea in the next section because therexe2x80x99s so much that goes into it.(Regarding the point about China, there could be a kind of AI equivalent of the resource curse going on with Chinaxe2x80x99s dataset free-for-all. Because they have all the data they want about people, in unlimited quantities, they donxe2x80x99t have to work as hard on algorithms and architectures as we do in the West. Instead of working around dataset limitations, they can always just get more data. More on that if and when I can get to it, though.)One of the things Ixe2x80x99ve mentioned in a few posts already is how little attention the AI ethics field gives to Washington DC. Itxe2x80x99s not that legislative considerations are entirely absent, but that feature far less prominently in AI ethics material than you might expect.I think there are a few things going on here, all of which merit further investigation:First, Congress cannot move at the speed of woke. Progressive language norms change way too rapidly for even a non-gridlocked legislative body to keep up. You can actually see this happening in real-time in the AI ethics field, where a paper that was xe2x80x9cwokexe2x80x9d in 2016 is now guilty of the sin of xe2x80x9cbiological essentialismxe2x80x9d in 2021.December 10th 2020The answer, then, is entryism xe2x80x94 specifically, taking over corporate HR and professional guilds, so you can exert constant pressure on the entire field via Twitter pile-ons, call-outs, cancellations, and the other tools in the activist toolbox. This gets you further, faster than legislation ever could.The second factor that makes legislation less attractive is the concentration of power in the hands of a few companies. There just arenxe2x80x99t many entities that have the resources to buy and maintain the kind of hardware you need to do cutting-edge machine learning work. Facebook, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, and maybe a handful of others have access to the amount of hardware and data you need to move the needle in ML right now.This concentration means there are a few critical nodes in the entire system, and if you can capture those nodes, itxe2x80x99s game over. Why would you bother with Washington if you could gain power by just being in the right meetings at about five companies that represent the bulk of leading-edge AI work?Finally, the guild of researchers doing this work at a high level is still quite small. Wexe2x80x99re still in a period of innovation where the right individual and the right access to resources can make a major advance. This is like the early days of software, where the right handful of people came together and invented UNIX, or the WIMP paradigm (window, icons, menus, pointer).The AI equivalents of UNIX and WIMP are just now xe2x80x94 as in since maybe 2016 or so xe2x80x94 being invented. Thatxe2x80x99s where wexe2x80x99re at, so despite the fact that everyone on Clubhouse is hustling some kind of AI or ML in their bio, the actual club of people who can push things forward is still small.This analogy is still a work-in-progress, but I find myself reaching for it every time I talk with someone about this problem of regulating algorithms: the problem of regulating AI/ML is a lot like the problem of regulating the financial system.The first point of congruence between AI and banking is the aforementioned insider/outsider problem. I already touched on this in the first section, so I wonxe2x80x99t repeat that. Ixe2x80x99ll just extend that material by noting that right now, the field is in a really exciting place with a lot going on, and the pace of change is rapid.So, big salaries aside, it will be hard to find true insiders willing to go into regulation, or even to sprinkle time on regulation. Ixe2x80x99m sure therexe2x80x99s no shortage of academics whose knowledge is ~3 years out-of-date who think theyxe2x80x99re up-to-speed and ready to talk regulation, but thatxe2x80x99s not the same as having real insiders at the helm.The second way banking and AI look alike to me, is in the area of scale and leverage. I have this idea, which Ixe2x80x99ve written about previously and would love to develop further at some point, that some technologies are a form of leverage.Networked computing technologies, for instance, are like a lever in that they act as force multipliers. A few engineers or marketers can shift the behavior of billions of people with the force of a few keystrokes, so cloud tech is a lever in the Archimedean sense (xe2x80x9cGive me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the worldxe2x80x9d).AI is similar, in that itxe2x80x99s a force multiplier that lets a few people in the right position do big things at scale. Examples would be everything from a general commanding a drone army, to an AI-powered hedge fund that moves markets.Tech is like leverage in the sense of debt, too. It piles on risks of various kinds as it scales, both for the party thatxe2x80x99s depending on it and for the larger system itself.In both finance and tech, itxe2x80x99s possible to find simple numbers (often used by businesses themselves) that you can make rules about, in order to impose constraints. Such simple numbers are effective to target and difficult to game. For example, as complex as banking is, a bank can be limited in size (and made safer) by a simple cap on its tier one capital ratio. Similarly, if I were trying to limit the size of a consumer-facing tech platform, Ixe2x80x99d look at the size of the users table. Every tech platform in existence knows exactly how many users it has at any moment, and what state those users are in (active, inactive, churned, etc.). So thatxe2x80x99s a number a regulator could focus on if theyxe2x80x99re looking at size. I donxe2x80x99t know what simple numbers lurk in the world of machine learning (maybe around some measure of model size), but Ixe2x80x99m certain they will emerge in due time.Following on all of the above, Ixe2x80x99d like to offer the following hypothesis: as a technology, machine learning is safer right now because the barriers to entry are so high (high up-front capex, and rare expertise); if and when that changes, wexe2x80x99re likely to face the AI equivalent of a series of Wildcat banking crises.Just like in banking, I suspect itxe2x80x99s going to take a major crisis (or a series of them) to create a demand for real regulation.I strongly prefer my finance analogy for AI over the standard food-and-drug analogy. So I really think the entire AI regulation discussion should be structured along these lines because all the regulatory lessons wexe2x80x99ll need to learn if wexe2x80x99re going to make this work are in the world of banking, trading, and markets.Agencies like the FDA and OSHA may be liberal darlings, and the state of our financial markets a complete mess, but Ixe2x80x99m nonetheless convinced that markets are a far better model for the fast-moving, competitive world of AI.February 4th 2021Ultimately, AI isnxe2x80x99t a product. Itxe2x80x99s a diverse set of technologies that go into products, and into the systems that make the products, and into the systems that make the systems that make the products, and so on. So any attempt to regulate it like a packaged consumer good will fall far short and do more harm than good.You have to regulate it like the advanced, esoteric, economically critical set of practices and technologies that it increasingly is. And that calls for some kind of finance-style regulation, and not consumer product safety regulation.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Good thoughtful piece - The point about regulation needing to be more like finance and less like the FDA seems key, but the concerns of regulatory capture are also clear. Beyond the obvious, standard arguments of slowing down innovation, regulatory capture, etc. (or perhaps as instances of those), what do you think *poor* regulation of AI could lead to? This question could include both what you think are the most likely bad regulations we could see and what the consequences of those would be.

It is everything Ixe2x80x99ve been writing about in this newsletter, packaged into a really wonderful interactive tool thatxe2x80x99s hosted on Googlexe2x80x99s servers:March 17th 2021This newly released project, a Google Explorable, was something both Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell were working on before their departure from Google. Take a moment to look through the demo and play with it, and read the accompanying text. Then come back when youxe2x80x99ve poked at it for a minute.I want to pull a few main take-aways from this work in this post, though therexe2x80x99s enough here that I could probably keep going on it for considerably longer. Thatxe2x80x99ll have to wait for future posts, though.Itxe2x80x99s important to have a few intuitions about how some popular machine learning models are trained and used before you can grasp whatxe2x80x99s going on in the new Explorable. Donxe2x80x99t worry, there is no math here! This section is written for non-nerds.(Note: What I say in this section doesnxe2x80x99t apply to all types of ML, or even to all neural networks. But my goal here is to develop useful intuitions in lay readers, and not to fully explain the tech.)In the diagram below, we have a training dataset that represents something in the world xe2x80x94 a library of street signs, an archive of chat messages, a collection of pictures of wild plants, etc. For our purposes, this dataset has been cleaned up and maybe even tagged by humans, so at some low level, it has had some structure and meaning baked into it before the machine sees it.Our untrained model is then trained on this dataset using some kind of training algorithm and over a certain duration of time. Now, this training will shape and alter the model, so that it begins to develop some kind of internal structures that represent certain features and aspects of the training data.When itxe2x80x99s fully trained, the modelxe2x80x99s internal arrangement of weights and neurons now encodes some kinds of knowledge (we may not be sure what kinds until we test it) about the dataset. The model will have inferred patterns in the data and may have even learned some number of novel, higher-order synchronic (when this happens, that also happens) and diachronic (after this happens, that then happens) rules that govern the data and that humans would never have noticed.In this next diagram, we use the model by giving it some input that it has not seen before, and itxe2x80x99s giving some output that itxe2x80x99s quite similar (but not identical) to part of its training data. Maybe our model is a language model, and wexe2x80x99ve just given it a new configuration of words (along with a brand new word it has never seen), and itxe2x80x99s spitting out a sequence of words that make sense to us as a rephrasing (or even a translation) of the input words.So to summarize, the steps wexe2x80x99ve just gone through are like this:We collect and curate a set of training data that reflects facts about the world, or represents things in the world.We train the model on that data, so the model represents knowledge of those facts or things and of the relationships between them.We use the trained model by giving it inputs and then interpreting its outputs in some way we find useful.The take-away: The trained model reflects the dataset. More importantly, that modelxe2x80x99s output xe2x80x94 which we humans may be relying on to discover new facts about the world xe2x80x94 also reflects the dataset (among other things).The Explorablexe2x80x99s opener contains a succinct summary of probably 75 percent (at least) of all work on AI ethics (emphasis mine):Search, ranking and recommendation systems can help find useful documents in large datasets. However, these datasets reflect the biases of the society in which they were created and the systems risk re-entrenching those biases. For example, if someone who is not a white man searches for xe2x80x9cCEO picturesxe2x80x9d and sees a page of white men, they may feel that only white men can be CEOs, further perpetuating lack of representation at companiesxe2x80x99 executive levels.There are two parts to the text Ixe2x80x99ve emphasized:Datasets reflect the biases of society.Allowing those dataset biases to be reflected in the model perpetuates them in society.Let me rewrite these two points in a way that makes plain whatxe2x80x99s at stake:Historical texts, monuments, and symbols reflect the biases of society.Allowing those historical biases to be reflected in current cultural products perpetuates those biases in society.I can also rewrite these in yet another way that makes a related point:Old books and TV shows reflect the biases of society.Allowing those historical biases to shape young minds perpetuates those biases in society.This is the struggle wexe2x80x99re currently in across our whole society, is it not?I think everyone agrees that many parts of our societyxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cdatasetxe2x80x9d (certain written histories, childrenxe2x80x99s books, statues, flags, etc.) reflect societyxe2x80x99s historic biases. The question is, what, if anything, to do about it?There are many who favor deliberative, incremental changes to the status quo, but you canxe2x80x99t publicly take that position lest you get whacked with certain MLK quote about the xe2x80x9cwhite moderate.xe2x80x9dThen there are those who look at the power of the digital age xe2x80x94 the power to erase or rewrite the past with just a few clicks and keystrokes xe2x80x94 and think, xe2x80x9cif we are on the side of justice, then why should we wait?xe2x80x9dIf the inputs into our culture xe2x80x94 letxe2x80x99s speak frankly: the inputs that go into the formation of young human minds xe2x80x94 are all digital, then what is the moral argument for not sanitizing them immediately?I think there is only one such argument, the argument from humility. This argument requires the would-be sanitizers to cede that, no matter how monstrous certain features of societyxe2x80x99s digital dataset seem to them, they may be in the wrong about that. We may actually end up needing what you would delete from the cultural hard drive.I think very few people xe2x80x94 especially not people keen on sanitizing xe2x80x94 are willing to entertain the possibility that something they feel in the very core of their being to be an unjust horror is, in fact, righteous, and it is rather they who are on the side of evil in some matter.Few wokes are willing to xe2x80x9chold spacexe2x80x9d for the problematic. Few Christians are willing to keep the door open for sin.Of course, true believers have always been this way. Whatxe2x80x99s new in this moment is the fact that entire swaths of culture can be cleared from our collective memory with a few keystrokes by someone with the right access. This can be (and is being) done with very little oversight or deliberation, and by a tiny handful of unknown private-sector employees.This power is new, as is the concentration of it into so few hands.The bulk of the Explorable is quite literally a digital implementation of the classic and much-maligned quota system. The tool, shown in the image below, has set a quota for a certain amount of representation in the dataset and then lets you manipulate the data in order to meet the set quota.This is very much the fashionable concept of xe2x80x9cequity,xe2x80x9d rendered in the interactive widget form. The goal of the new-deprecated notion of xe2x80x9cequalityxe2x80x9d was xe2x80x9ceveryone gets the same chance because the system is blind.xe2x80x9d The goal of equity, then, is xe2x80x9ceveryone gets the same outcome because the system is actively discriminatory in order to meet a target.xe2x80x9dThis tool, then, invites you to play at enforcing racial and gender equity at the level of the training data, so that the training data no longer reflects society but reflects the quota that has been imposed by the activists.In this respect, this widget is a preview of everything digital that is touched by machine learning (which is to say, itxe2x80x99s a preview of everything digital, full stop). There will be quotas, and the social engineering of xe2x80x9cequityxe2x80x9d will take place at the level of the dataset. So that when society uses the outputs of the trained model, those outputs reflect (and, itxe2x80x99s hoped, perpetuate) the equity that was engineered into them.The truly xe2x80x9cmetaxe2x80x9d part of this work is in the second section, where intersectionality is introduced.The problem the activists face is that peoplexe2x80x99s identities arenxe2x80x99t reducible to one single attribute, so you canxe2x80x99t just impose a quota for a single attribute and target that. For the woke, humans are reducible to at least three attributes xe2x80x94 race, gender identity, and sexual orientation xe2x80x94 so if youxe2x80x99re trying to meet a quota for each of these, then you have yourself a multivariate optimization problem.Fortunately, we have ample math for exactly this category of problems, and indeed machine learning algorithms have gotten good at it, as well.Intersectionality, it turns out, takes the mathematics of oppression from the scalar realm into the vector realm. Instead of being identified by a single attribute, youxe2x80x99re identified by an ordered row of them: [race, gender, sexuality]. Intersectionality positions you in multidimensional space; the simple spectrum of privilege becomes a complex manifold of privilege that you can locate individuals on the surface of.Herexe2x80x99s a screenshot of the more sophisticated tool that lets you play at solving this multivariate optimization problem:This, too, is the future of the digital age: At some point, some social engineering algorithms will reduce you to a vector of identity characteristics, and the direction of that vector will determine how much you get of some scarce societal good.Where you fall on the manifold of privilege will determine how close you are to something that many want but only a few can have. Of course, the woke would argue that the world is already this way and that they just want to use digital technologies to correct that xe2x80x94 to achieve equity by changing the shape of the manifold.If all this bothers you, then the question I have for you is: are you going to stop them? Because this is happening. It is the baseline scenario. If you want things to turn out otherwise, the time to speak up is right now.I said above that identitarians reduce identity to three characteristics: race, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Youxe2x80x99ll notice, though, that therexe2x80x99s only one of these three considered in the final section of the paper, where the abstract shapes in the widgets give way to real identity characteristics.That characteristic is gender, and this section contains examples of doctors and construction workers whose xe2x80x9cgender presentationxe2x80x9d is discussed and classified by the authors.I put xe2x80x9cgender presentationxe2x80x9d in scare quotes because I think therexe2x80x99s a bit of jiu-jitsu going on with it. In short, the authors have to maneuver around the objections that the AI ethicists have raised with the very idea that machine learning can or should be used to classify photographs by gender.In a widely circulated talk on fairness in image processing systems, Timnit Gebru spends considerable time insisting that any attempt to infer gender from photographs is problematic xe2x80x94 that the very task of inferring gender from a photo is maybe not one that anybody should use machine learning for.Gebru takes gender to be an inner, felt reality that can only be expressed and never inferred from appearances.But of course, the whole premise of this section of the project (which she contributed to) is that not only can you infer something meaningful about gender from photographs, but that itxe2x80x99s actually important to the cause of equity to be able to do so.What it boils down to, then, is that itxe2x80x99s not only possible but desirable to infer gender from photographs if youxe2x80x99re the right person doing it for the right reasons (i.e. to fit a quota). But otherwise, this entire ML task is problematic.The two dogs that didnxe2x80x99t bark in this section are the other two identity characteristics: race and sexual orientation. Regarding the former, a lot of the tasks one can imagine using an ML-powered racial profiler for are creepy and bad, so you rarely see this come up (though I did hear someone float it in a Clubhouse room as a way of automatically ordering the speaker queue). And regarding the latter, automated detection of sexual orientation from photographs, it turns out that ML is eerily good at this and that unexpected fact makes everyone unhappy, so itxe2x80x99s now off-limits.The automated inference of sexual orientation is especially relevant, here. Because in the video above, Gebru touches on ML classification of sexuality and hypothesizes that the machines are merely picking up on certain stereotypical gay male grooming behaviors (then they infer an inner orientation from there). Ixe2x80x99d ask her, then, why is that practice not okay, but it is okay for the machines to pick up on certain stereotypical xe2x80x9cmasculine-presentingxe2x80x9d clothing and/or grooming characteristics to infer an inner xe2x80x9cgender identityxe2x80x9d?Klara and the SunThe Tyranny of StructurelessThe Mathematical Engineering of Deep LearningYou Canxe2x80x99t Escape Hyperparameters and Latent Variables: Machine Learning as a Software Engineering Enterprise, Charles IsbellMost impactful AI papers in last 3 yearsBook Review: How Everything Can Collapse: A Manual for Our TimesFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I find this incredibly interesting as someone who doesn't know much about machine learning.

Lots and lots of questions, the main ones being these:What qualifies you to decide for the rest of us what kinds of ethics AI should have? Do you come from a particular faith or philosophical tradition that you draw your ethical framework from? If so, are you recognized by others in that tradition as a voice to be listened to on these matters? Why should I care what you think about anything ethical? Convince me.Do you know the difference between ethics and morals? Because a lot of what youxe2x80x99re talking about are individual actions and attitudes, internal mental states and unconscious habits of mind, matters of basic character xe2x80x94 all that sounds like morals, to me. And as a Christian, I have my own opinions about morals (and about ethics). Indeed, I often think your morals are corrupt, at least by the standards of my own tradition. The ways you address others, the content of what you say, and some of the specific policies you advocate for all strike me as morally bankrupt from time to time.Why is it ever the job of any engineer or researcher to think in a detailed, sophisticated way about ethics? I did an engineering degree, and neither I nor my peers had serious ethical training. In my career, Ixe2x80x99ve known many programmers, engineers, mathematicians, and scientists of different types, and passing few of them are sophisticated philosophers or spiritual authorities. Why do you think ethics belongs on the plate of these professions?Why is it ever the job of a private company to police the morals of a population? Who gives a company the power to separate truth from lies, or healing words from harmful ones? Why is the proper moral and cultural formation of a democratic citizenry any private enterprisexe2x80x99s responsibility?Why do you complain that engineers think they can fix the world with code, and also enjoin those same engineers to try and fix the world with their code? Are they supposed to step back and not presume to xe2x80x9cfixxe2x80x9d certain larger social problems with code, or are they supposed to tweak their code so that it fixes certain larger social problems? Make up your mind.I have more questions, but Ixe2x80x99ll stop here for now.The latter questions in that list were raised for me by this tweet:Yann LeCun @ylecunMarch 11th 2021I would love for Cathy Oxe2x80x99Neil, whose work I admire and whose book I recommend, to explain to me in an interview why she thinks Yann LeCun was wrong to object that big-picture issues of ethics and fairness are above his pay grade. Because I get no indication from his CV or his Twitter feed that hexe2x80x99s an ethicist of any note or a moral thinker of any particular depth.LeCun seems to me to be a brilliant, pioneering AI researcher, and someone who Ixe2x80x99d look to for answers about AI. But I would not look to him for answers about what kind of world we should all live in, or what xe2x80x9cfairnessxe2x80x9d looks like in any given context, or what ethics should govern the development and use of which technologies. Why should I?I understand that many in AI ethics believe theyxe2x80x99ve made the case that the responsibility for fixing the crappy state of our present world falls at least partly on the shoulders of AI researchers, but I think they have not made it. Indeed, I think they havenxe2x80x99t really tried.What theyxe2x80x99ve done quite effectively is point out that AI has the potential to make things considerably worse in certain areas. But identifying a problem is not the same as making the case that STEM professionals are morally obligated to fix it.Why is this not much more the responsibility of the MBAs? The product managers? The VPs? The CEO? What is the case for convincing the engineers to tackle these big-picture questions?I said in yesterdayxe2x80x99s post that Ixe2x80x99d be willing to cede the existence of a link between political polarization and user engagement on social media. This fits with my own personal experience of these platforms, and with what I know of them. It certainly fits with the media reporting on these issues, which is quite uniform in identifying the rise in social media use with all kinds of ills.LeCun, though, responded by trying to make a case that there is no such link and that claims of such a link are not supported by data.March 12th 2021In a tweet thatxe2x80x99s buried in the Twitter threading, LeCun cites this paper to make the case that political polarization and social media use are not, in fact, linked.He also tries to make the case for AI as a moderating force within Facebook xe2x80x94 a way to fight polarization:March 12th 2021In a nutshell, LeCun is arguing that AI can greatly increase the effectiveness of human moderators, by acting as a kind of force multiplier via machine translation and automated early detection of malicious content.Like the link between Facebook and polarization that LeCun denies, this positive use of AI internally to Facebook seems plausible, to me. I can believe they do use it this way internally, and that itxe2x80x99s a net social good in that role.I wish there were more in-depth reporting on the social upsides of AI, specifically the kind of thing LeCun is outlining here. But there isnxe2x80x99t. The AI press is dominated by crusaders who share one agenda, and that agenda is best summed up in the chant heard on the streets this past summer: xe2x80x9cIf we donxe2x80x99t get it, burn it down.xe2x80x9dI actually think this agenda is why therexe2x80x99s relatively little talk of government regulation in AI ethics conversation and so much emphasis on the identity characteristics and tribal allegiances of the employees in specific roles at a handful of companies. You canxe2x80x99t capture Big AI via the government, because the field is too obscure and moves too fast for lawmakers to follow; so you try to xe2x80x9cget itxe2x80x9d by capturing the companies and the guild. And if that effort fails, therexe2x80x99s always the Molotov.Facebook released a big paper on fairness and bias in its AI systems yesterday, which sparked the Twitter discussions Ixe2x80x99ve highlighted above.The content of the paper is mildly interesting, and I may have more to say about it later. But what Ixe2x80x99m really watching for is the reception of it in the AI ethics community.This paper is very much an xe2x80x9cAI ethicsxe2x80x9d paper of the kind youxe2x80x99d find coming out of the ACM FAccT group, but it has one flaw that may prove fatal: it came from Facebook, and not from the FAccT clique.And there is a clique. Ixe2x80x99ve heard that there were a bunch of irregularities around submissions process this year and that itxe2x80x99s essentially a closed publishing venue for the circle around the Google ethical AI group.Ixe2x80x99m looking to report more on that, so if you have details to share, please get in touch.ShareFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"An open letter, and Facebook's side of the story - doxa","url":"https://doxa.substack.com/p/an-open-letter-and-facebooks-side"}

I have some really interesting new research to highlight for you, once I get through it, myself. But in the meantime, here are two quick takes that Ixe2x80x99ll develop further in future posts.Karen Hao at Technology Review has a new, in-depth piece out on Facebook's internal AI ethics efforts. The piece is deeply reported, and very much worth reading.I should clarify before going any further, though: to say I am not a fan of Haoxe2x80x99s coverage is an understatement. Her work is one-sided, and shexe2x80x99s openly doing anti-tech and anti-AI activism under the guise of xe2x80x9cjournalism.xe2x80x9dWith that out of the way, you should read the piece. Therexe2x80x99s a lot there worth thinking about.To zero in on just one thing, I find it impossible to take issue with the following:Everything the company does and chooses not to do flows from a single motivation: Zuckerbergxe2x80x99s relentless desire for growth. Quixc3xb1oneroxe2x80x99s AI expertise supercharged that growth. His team got pigeonholed into targeting AI bias, as I learned in my reporting, because preventing such bias helps the company avoid proposed regulation that might, if passed, hamper that growth. Facebook leadership has also repeatedly weakened or halted many initiatives meant to clean up misinformation on the platform because doing so would undermine that growth.The above is all of Big Tech and AI in a single paragraph. To boil it down even further:Large public companies are driven by a growth imperative, and all else is subordinate to that.The internal AI watchdog and ethics groups are primarily there to head off external regulation. (All corporate self-regulatory efforts have this purpose since the beginning of capitalism. If you thought it could possibly be otherwise in AI, I dunno what to tell you.)Obvious biases against specific groups xe2x80x94 black people, conservatives xe2x80x94 have a specific set of qualities that make them attractive for self-regulatory efforts inside companies to tackle, and indeed the way the AI ethics folks talk about the problem feeds into that dynamic.On this last point, read my first post for much more on this topic of bias in AI. I wonxe2x80x99t recap any of that, but to extend that material, I think the dynamic at work is probably something like this:Take the examples wexe2x80x99ve seen of clear-cut cases of blatant racial bias in AI, especially in image processing and/or synthesis. I suspect these examples are to xe2x80x9cAI harmsxe2x80x9d what mass shootings are to xe2x80x9cgun violencexe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 the stuff of viral threads, alarming headlines, and committees on how we must Do Something. The truly insidious bias problems lurk in areas like medicine, finance, and law enforcement, but those donxe2x80x99t go as viral as something like the xe2x80x9cwhite Obamaxe2x80x9d image.Activists push these obvious algorithmic bias cases as a way to get attention to the issue, even though they arenxe2x80x99t anything like the bulk of the problem. And for their part, companies like tackling these high-profile examples because itxe2x80x99s pretty easy to offer a one-off fix for a specific model that lets the company look like it really did something while leaving the larger structural problems in place.If you go a bit further down in the piece, youxe2x80x99ll see this bit that dovetails on the above point:One such project heavily pushed by company leaders involved predicting whether a user might be at risk for something several people had already done: livestreaming their own suicide on Facebook Live. The task involved building a model to analyze the comments that other users were posting on a video after it had gone live, and bringing at-risk users to the attention of trained Facebook community reviewers who could call local emergency responders to perform a wellness check. It didnxe2x80x99t require any changes to content-ranking models, had negligible impact on engagement, and effectively fended off negative press. It was also nearly impossible, says the researcher: xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s more of a PR stunt. The efficacy of trying to determine if somebody is going to kill themselves in the next 30 seconds, based on the first 10 seconds of video analysisxe2x80x94youxe2x80x99re not going to be very effective.xe2x80x9dItxe2x80x99s the same combination: a dramatic, high-profile problem thatxe2x80x99s (thankfully) quite rare, and an effort to publicly be seen as working on xe2x80x9cthe solvexe2x80x9d for it.Of course, the big bias problem Zuck was worried about at Facebook wasnxe2x80x99t racial bias: it was political bias. Specifically, the charges of anti-conservative bias coming from Trump and the GOP.Nonetheless, the problem of anti-conservative bias has all the features identified above: itxe2x80x99s relatively easy to brute-force a fix, usually via a quota of some type, that addresses whatever immediate problem that has been identified while leaving in-place the larger structural issues that created the problem.  The main conclusion I draw from all of this is that big companies actually like playing Whack-A-Mole with some types of problems. If you can stand up an internal watchdog group to play an endless game of Whac-A-Mole on a string of tractable-seeming problems, then you have something to testify about when you get periodically called before the authorities.I have mixed feelings about all this because I do not believe it is Facebookxe2x80x99s job to xe2x80x9cfixxe2x80x9d the larger social problems that activists like Hao and the AI ethicists want to be solved. I donxe2x80x99t want private companies like Facebook trying to remake society along activist lines, primarily because I disagree with the activists and I do not share their goals. Ixe2x80x99d rather Facebook continue to play Whack-A-Mole than see it taken over by kinds of people and ideas Hao aggressively promotes in her articles and on her feed.And yet, Ixe2x80x99m totally willing to cede the reality of the link between engagement and political polarization that an internally suppressed Facebook report supposedly found, and I think if left to their own devices social media platforms may xe2x80x9cengagementxe2x80x9d our civilization to death.Like the AI researcher at the center of Haoxe2x80x99s article, I have to admit that I donxe2x80x99t know what the answer is.Ricexe2x80x99s Moshe Vardi has published an editorial in the latest Communications of the ACM arguing for Big Tech to be cut down to size by antitrust actions. He writes:The issue has always been xe2x80x9clarge,xe2x80x9d not xe2x80x9ctech,xe2x80x9d but the connection between large size and tech stands out.c In 1901, President Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to curb the power of trusts because of their size: xe2x80x9cGreat corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions,xe2x80x9d he said, adding that it is xe2x80x9cour right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions.xe2x80x9d Anti-trust law enforcement has served us well over the past 130 years. With market capitalization of the top five Big Tech corporations now at over USD7T,d the people, working through governments, are carrying on this anti-trust law legacy. It should be welcomed!I am and have been an ardent proponent of using antitrust tools to break up Big Tech, but I will say that lately there is one wrinkle that gives me a bit of pause as I try to think this through: when it comes to AI, size matters in ways that it just doesnxe2x80x99t for many other categories of technology.The present-day era of consumer voice recognition, image classification, AlphaGo, and synthesis technologies like DeepFakes and GPT-3 kicked off fairly recently. The AI community struggled through an AI winter that finally, in about 2010, gave way to the present-day AI spring.What was the breakthrough that led to the rush of innovation? Ixe2x80x99ll have a lot more to say about that in a future post, but I can sum it up for now in one word: size.Most of the math and basic architecture behind machine learning hasnxe2x80x99t changed fundamentally since I took classes in neural networks and computer vision in undergrad in 1998. Wexe2x80x99re actually not much closer to anything like a real copy of any part of the human mind than we were when Netscape was the hot new browser.Rather, what wexe2x80x99ve figured out since then, is that if you take a set of neural net architectures that are essentially toys, and throw enough advanced computer hardware and terabytes of training data at them, they magically turn into something that feels fundamentally different.Put another way, machine learning is one of the only places where sheer quantity translates directly into a dramatic increase in quality past some threshold. The bigger the model xe2x80x94 measured in both the size of the training dataset and the amount of hardware and energy it takes to run it xe2x80x94 the better the results.This bigger-is-better reality has some important implications for society, especially in the area of antitrust. The size of the models needed to really produce the kind of spectacular output wexe2x80x99re seeing with GPT-3, means that bigger companies with more hardware and deeper pockets will own this rapidly developing space. It cost some $4.6 million just to train GPT-3 xe2x80x94 not to hire the researchers to build it, or to buy the hardware to run it, but just to train it.With these kinds of up-front costs, AI currently has a kind of mainframe-era feel to it. You really need big machines with big budgets to do big projects. It is not two-guys-in-a-garage-in-Palo-Alto friendly. The cost of running and training these large models needs to lose a decimal place or two before it gets there.The unreasonable effectiveness of sheer scale in ML may mean that any business built on it lends itself to a kind of natural monopoly situation.Ixe2x80x99m an anti-monopolist, so I donxe2x80x99t take this to be good news. I'm guessing the ideal way forward here is some kind of government-run hardware that qualifying startups can rent time on at a massively subsidized rate. But the usual suspects would want veto power over which projects qualify and which donxe2x80x99t, and unlike in the private sector theyxe2x80x99d have a reasonable case for getting it.Again, I donxe2x80x99t have answers. These are hard structural problems.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.One thing that frustrates me about the whole dialogue is ever since The Social Dilemma people have presumed that engagement algorithms are the problem, and therefore getting rid of them will fix the problem.

They may exacerbate the problem, but we see the same sorts of fake news, radicalization in both directions, and echo chamber isolation on Reddit where the algorithm is nothing more that \"upvotes make the article go up,\" or on college sports forums whose only algorithm is the \"bump.\"The truly brutal algorithm is buried in our minds.

Oh, and also the fact that they're meant to be laws xe2x80x94 not optional recommendations. The FT's authors point to a specific piece of legislation, H.R.2231 - Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, as a first step in implementing this three-part agenda. They'd like to see a lot more such steps.The FT editorial opens with a central yet false claim that goes directly to an issue at the heart of the entire AI ethics debate: what does it mean for a set of training data to be xe2x80x9cunrepresentativexe2x80x9d?The FT authors summarize Mitchell and her coauthors on the \"Stochastic Parrots\" paper as arguing that the large language models Google and other companies employ \"rely on unrepresentative data sets. [emphasis mine]\" But this is just not true, and at least in the \"Stochastic Parrots\" paper this term is not used.The problem Mitchell, Gebru, and their allies repeatedly identify with AI training data xe2x80x94 not just in this latest paper but more generally across the AI ethics' fields years of work xe2x80x94 is precisely the opposite: these datasets are too representative of our actually existing (problematic, colonized, cisheteropatri-all-the-things) world.The AI ethics activists don't like that these large AIs are trained on data from the normie world of microaggressions, gendered language, and implicit biases xe2x80x94 they're trying to destroy that world, so they'd not see it perpetuated by a globe-spanning, energy-sucking artificial intelligence.One might say that in the taxonomy of critical race theorists described by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic in Critical Race Theory: An Introduction, the AI ethicists who'd sanitize the world's problematic datasets seem to be \"idealists\":One camp, which we may call \"idealists,\" holds that racism and discrimination are matters of thinking, mental organization, attitude, and discourse. Race is a social construction, not a biological reality, they reason. Hence we may unmake it and deprive it of much of its sting by changing the system of images, words, attitudes, unconscious feelings, scripts, and social teachings by which we convey to one another that certain people are less intelligent, reliable, hardworking, virtuous, and American than others.1To paint a more concrete picture of what this might look like: the ethics people want to be able to do for the language used by consumer products like Alexa and the Google search box what activist orgs are already doing to great effect for the media, i.e., circulate a guide for what to say and what not to say (like this, or this), so that we end up with headlines that have X's sprinkled through them where vowels should be, or with constructions like \"vulva owners\" instead of \"women.\"One gets the sense, fairly or unfairly, that they'd like Google to tell you, \"I can't find any results for 'breastfeeding.' Did you mean, chestfeeding?\"As a society, we're now facing this same issue everywhere, including in the innards of these AI models:Will we permit the continued existence of large, public representations of \"problematic\" worldviews xe2x80x94 children's books, TV show episodes, school names, statues, machine learning models trained on normie vocabulary xe2x80x94 or will we purge all this stuff and reset everything in our culture to fit with new, woke norms?There are only two possible answers to this question: xe2x80x9cyesxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cno.xe2x80x9d You may be allergic to binaries, but you will nonetheless have to pick a side on this one, eventually. It is not going away.The first of the FT's proposed rules (\"Teams that develop AI systems must be as diverse as possible to reduce the risk of bias.\") corresponds to an avenue I wanted to go down in my Google Colosseum post, but couldn't. Why? Because it's a really short avenue that quickly leads to a dead-end.To be specific: I have yet to see a single argument laying out in any detail how bumping up the skin-tone hex code on the AI brain trust xe2x80x94 by \"brain trust\" I mean the handful of highly paid uber-nerds who develop the algorithms that implementation engineers then train and release into the world xe2x80x94 will lead to social justice changes in commercial machine learning models.Indeed, there are two things here that are routinely hand-waved over in these discussions:How the mathematics, or even the selection of certain functions and benchmarks, would be different if the whiteboard crowd were less white.The fact that a non-trivial number of the researchers in any given company's brain trust are Asian or Jewish. (At least, this is so in my experience and that of many ML people Ixe2x80x99ve talked to.)I'm going to go ahead and propose that this stuff is hand-waved over because it is not real. And it is not real, because incentives trump identity.Any group of black and brown math nerds, given the same market pressures and business mandates as the Asians, Jews, and white guys that make up the AI teams at companies like Google and Facebook, will produce work with biases that are indistinguishable from what we're already seeing.Change my mind.The FT's second rule is a doozy: \"Complex AI systems should never be deployed in any field unless they offer a demonstrable improvement on what already exists.\"They are very straightforwardly and openly asking for a veto on the market's ability to meet demand with products backed by machine learning.I see this specific demand xe2x80x94 that ML workers should first question if a product should even be built, then maybe don't build it xe2x80x94 come up again and again and again from certain quarters.Here's a random example that came across my feed just yesterday:Ferris Jabr @ferrisjabrFebruary 28th 2021And here's a short thread from me on an entire paper I came across this week arguing that a whole category of ML tasks probably should not exist:March 1st 2021This same argument xe2x80x94 maybe don't ever build a machine learning model that tries to infer gender from text or images, because the very idea is problematic xe2x80x94 comes up in a widely circulated talk by Timnit Gebru:You might imagine that this veto power over what kinds of ML models should exist and what kinds should not, is to be ultimately vested in a democratically elected government. But so far, you'd be mostly wrong.Congress moves too slow for language that changes at the speed of woke, so the movement needs a way to get out ahead of problematic ML before it even gets deployed. So if you follow the activism in this space, you quickly realize that DC isn't where the main fight is.Instead of government regulation (or maybe, in addition to regulation), the AI ethics activists would like to see AI researchers and engineers themselves deciding that this or that problem should not be solved by ML because it might cause \"harm.\"This bottom-up veto idea is behind a lot of the tech workplace organizing that's happening right now. The veto power is to be vested in the Google union, where the activists can work from the inside to ensure that certain subjects are not even broached, certain tasks never proposed, certain categories of problems never even considered.It's also behind the unending Twitter pile-ons, where researchers are publicly browbeaten into retracting conference papers because of problematic language. For instance, this researcher's paper assumed a gender binary, which enraged a non-binary colleague.July 8th 2020The offending researcher quickly caved and tried to retract the paper:July 9th 2020These pile-ons (and cavings and retractions) are happening routinely, not just on Twitter but at conferences. The ultimate goal is to hand over control of the research agenda for the entire AI/ML field to a loud, aggressive minority that would set itself up with veto power over what questions can be even be asked.I do not actually think they would disagree with my characterization, here. Like Ibrahim X. Kendixe2x80x99s idea of a kind of all-powerful anti-racism committee that gets the final word on whether any part of our society is racist or not, and has the power to reorganize it if it is, the AI ethicists are not shy about proposing that they be in charge of absolutely everything.Clearly, theyxe2x80x99re going to have to kill capitalism before they seize the marketxe2x80x99s deciding power for themselves. That bigger project is well underway, I guess.The third proposed rule is one I'm actually somewhat sympathetic to, but itxe2x80x99s also the one that worries me the most: xe2x80x9cAlgorithms that companies and governments deploy in sensitive areas such as healthcare, education, policing, justice and workplace monitoring should be subject to audit and comprehension by outside experts.xe2x80x9dThose who follow me on Twitter know I'm an anti-monopoly, pro-regulation capitalist. I unabashedly believe a democratically elected government has an active role to play in mitigating many of the downsides of capitalism. But I part company with many on the left when it comes time to actually define and measure capitalismxe2x80x99s downsides, or xe2x80x9charms.xe2x80x9dSo if the proposed regulation looks anything like a Kendi-style algorithmic justice committee, where appointed bureaucrats and activists are deciding which models are harmful and why, Ixe2x80x99m going to be on the opposite side of that fight, sharing a foxhole with the free market folks.However this shakes out, though, I can heartily endorse more transparency and better auditing tools at a minimum. Whatever we do by way of regulation will depend on how good we are at measuring the real-world impacts of ML systems xe2x80x94 both before and after deployment.We do this kind of measurement and regulation with power systems, financial systems, and other critical technologies, so my instinct is that we can do it with ML. Indeed, I think we will probably have to. But I'll develop that idea more in a later post.As for the new proposed law, H.R.2231, it is actually not that directly connected to any of the stuff the FT editorial is arguing for xe2x80x94 it's mainly about privacy and personal information, and how companies store and use that information. So it's a kind of camel's-nose-under-the-tent effort and not a big step.ShareYoav Goldberg posted a response to \"Stochastic Parrots\" that covers some of the same ground as my previous post, Google's Colosseum: A criticism of \"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models be Too Big\". I was almost done with my own draft when I came across this, but I do find it useful and may write about it more, later.This piece on The Gradient, Lessons from the PULSE Model and Discussion, by Andrey Kurenkov, is really the definitive roundup of Tweets related to the original LeCun vs. Gebru argument. I don't know what I think about Kurenkov's attempt to draw actionable lessons from this mess, but I think he did amazing work in gathering all this material together and organizing it. My Colosseum piece benefitted from it, greatly.Critical Race Theory: An Introduction, Delgado and Stefancic.

Yann LeCun, one of the figures most responsible for the modern state of AI and machine learning (ML), had been temporarily hounded off Twitter by a researcher at Google* named Timnit Gebru, who appeared to be leading a classic social media pile-on against him.Gebru is a leader in the young field of AI Ethics. What I found when I began following \"the ethics people,\" as their non-aligned colleagues in AI/ML often refer to them, is Gebru's Twitter spat with LeCun is one example of an ongoing debate she and her allies keep having with everyone else in the world of AI/ML.This debate is over bias in machine learning models xe2x80x94 race, class, and gender bias, mostlyxe2x80x94 and where the blame for this bias should be located. Yann LeCun @ylecunJune 21st 2020Thanks largely to the work of Gebru and her allies, everyone now agrees that many models the data science and machine learning (ML) field sends out into the world are dangerously biased. So the fight is over the source of the problem. And by xe2x80x9csource of the problem,xe2x80x9d I donxe2x80x99t just mean xe2x80x9cwhere in the plumbing of this complex technical apparatus does the bias live,xe2x80x9d though that's a part of it. But an even bigger part is about which people in which departments bear responsibility for the danger.June 27th 2020The contours of the split, at least as they manifest on Twitter, often boil down to this:Is the bias in the training data thatxe2x80x99s used to educate these complex pieces of software about the world? Because if so, then the fault lies with the engineers who train the models and deploy them for end users. They need to take more care in assembling their training datasets.Or, is the bias everywhere we look, including in the very design of the models themselves? In which case part of the problem originates all the way back on the whiteboards of the cloistered math nerds who make up the AI brain trusts at companies like Google and Facebook. Those guys need toxe2x80xa6 well, the answer mostly seems to be that they need to be less white.LeCun had faulted the training data for the bias evident in a new image synthesis model (more on that model later). In the infamous Twitter exchange, LeCun insisted that in this particular example, there was a straightforward fix for the obvious anti-black racial bias on display: just include more black faces in the modelxe2x80x99s training data.If the image synthesis algorithm were trained on an African dataset, LeCun argued, it would do a better job with nonwhite faces than one trained on a northern European dataset.This intuitive-sounding assertion promptly sent Gebru into orbit, and she lit into LeCun for not being familiar enough with a body of work that supposedly demonstrates how ML racial bias comes from far more than just the training data, and that indeed even the models themselves are biased.Fixing racial bias in AI is not just a matter of infusing the training data with more melanin (for example), the AI Ethics crowd argues xe2x80x94 the actual models are being developed by white guys, and their insular, white-guy priorities somehow surface as bias in the algorithms that go to work on the training data.VentureBeat @VentureBeatMay 21st 2020This assertion that the (white-guy-designed) models are intrinsically biased, and that there is definitely not a simple fix that involves tweaking the training data, is one of the central claims of the AI Ethics people. It comes up again and again.Here, for instance, is Google Brain's Sarah Hooker trying to make the bias-in-the-models case on Twitter:February 15th 2021I was glad to find this thread by Hooker. In all the time I've spent looking at this issue of model bias, the AI Ethics case for it has seemed to me powered entirely by a few simple truths, but armored up in dense, spiky layers of theory, math, and social justice jargon, so the ethics people can ride around in it like some post-apocalyptic war wagon, firing AKxe2x80x99s into the air and sending soft, startled ML geeks scrambling for cover.So I was worried I had been missing something xe2x80x94 that there was something more there than a few important but fairly basic insights that had been kitted out for culture war. But on going through the papers in it, it turns out not so much. (See the appendix for more detailed discussion of the papers in Hookerxe2x80x99s thread.)*Note: I did some reporting on the topic of Gebru's departure from Google, which I covered in a BARPod episode and won't get into in this post. Maybe in a future post I can rehash some of that and extend it, since the fallout is still in the news.As I've made my way through the AI Ethics material, I've found that much of it has a kind of snake-eating-its-tail quality: it often seems dedicated to complexifying a fairly simple, intuitive set of points about the power dynamics inherent in acts of simplification.Here's my first attempt to boil down the basic argument I see being made over and over again in AI Ethics work, with varying amounts of math, experimentation, and theory:Technologies for representing the world xe2x80x94 maps, photographs, audio recordings, financial risk models, machine learning language models, etc. xe2x80x94 are fundamentally selective and discriminatory in nature. These technologies make simplifying assumptions that are rooted in a hierarchy of value (i.e., some parts of the thing being represented are more important than others), and they necessarily de-emphasize or omit many details deemed less important by their builders and users.Some of these technologies themselves are simple and old, like the Mercator projection, and some are complex and new, like GPT-3, but they all involve (re-)presenting a kind of compressed, simplified, value-laden version of a thing that's out in the world.Representations produced by beneficiaries of the status quo will reflect status-quo values, and will tend to play a role in perpetuating the status quo.People who do not like the status quo will naturally object to those representations that perpetuate the status quo xe2x80x94 a statue of a dead guy, a literary canon, a large, profitable ML language model, etc.Now, none of these insights so far are new. But if you can find a hot new field of human endeavor to translate this stuff into, and you can bulk it up with the heft of a full-blown academic discipline, then you can have yourself a career chucking these truths into the glass lobbies of power.But let me not get ahead of myself. After all, like the AI Ethics crowd, I intend to milk this topic for newsletter fodder, so I'll have to pace myself.The representational practice of chopping reality up into little buckets of xe2x80x9csamexe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cdifferent,xe2x80x9d and then arranging those buckets into a hierarchy, with the result that the top of the hierarchy is present and the bottom is absent, is very much akin to what information theorists call lossy compression.Lossy compression is distinct from lossless compression. The former involves throwing some information out to reduce the size of the file, while the latter involves clever substitutions of symbols in order to reduce the file size without actual loss of information. We use lossy compression because we live in a world of constraints and tradeoffs, where bandwidth, storage, and energy are finite and must be rationed.Now, I don't necessarily take representation itself to be a form of lossy compression. Rather, my interest is in pointing out that both traditional acts of representation and modern lossy compression algorithms involve similar kinds of work.But first, another quick note on terminology: I'll refer to the object being represented (e.g. the scene a painter is painting, the territory a geographer is mapping, a file a compression algorithm developer is compressing) as the paradigm. I do this for convenience's sake, and as a little bit of a nod to Plato's Timaeus. (Though in the latter respect, I've basically inverted it from Plato's concept of the paradigm as a perfect, unchanging archetype that doesnxe2x80x99t exist in the material world. Anyway, that's a story for another day.)With that out of the way, here are some things done by anyone who's creating a representation, whether a sculpture or a compressed picture of a sculpture.Discrimination: This step is about identifying the signal that you're trying to preserve, as distinct from the noise. Separating signal from noise involves dividing the paradigm into a collection of qualities or features that can then be assigned values in the next step. Note that the simple act of naming one feature as \"signal\" and the other as \"noise\" involves imposing a hierarchy of your own on the paradigm.Organization: Lossy compression goes further than just separating signal from noise. It also identifies higher-value parts of the signal that have to be preserved, and lower-value parts that can be lost. This is the part where you ask, what are the essential parts of the paradigm that must be reflected in the representation, and what parts can be omitted? Yet again, more hierarchy.Evaluation: If you're creating a representation, or creating an algorithm for generating representations (e.g. a compression algorithm, a or mathematical model of some type), you'll always evaluate your results by comparing the features you identified in the original object (step 1) with your representation of those same features in the original object, checking for however much fidelity you think the representation should have.What falls out of this process is, ideally, a useful representation of some thing out there in the world. Obviously, it's not the thing itself (the map is not the territory!) but it's a handy way of getting our finite minds around the thing itself, and for communicating about the thing, and for reasoning about it, and for arguing with other humans about what the thing was and is and maybe should be.There are two main points I want to make about the above process:Creating a representation involves making tradeoffs and choices that reflect your values. Some parts of the paradigm will be elevated in a representation, while others will be left out.Insofar as we use representations to argue about the world, a representation is a bid for power in a world of scarcity and constraints.For instance, if you were representing the page below, then compute and/or storage constraints might force you to pick which parts of it to include and which to ignore. In most contexts, if youxe2x80x99re forced to pick between Platoxe2x80x99s Greek text and the commentary in the margins, odds are the marginalia get cropped out.ML types are well aware that the basic human machinery of perception and representation is inherently discriminatory and hierarchical. For instance, here's a portion of a paper on ethical problems in large image datasets that covers much the same ground I just did:Finally, zooming out and taking a broad perspective allows us to see that the very practice of embarking on a classification, taxonomization, and labeling task endows the classifier with the power to decide what is a legitimate, normal, or correct way of being, acting, and behaving in the social world [10]. For any given society, what comes to be perceived as normal or acceptable is often dictated by dominant ideologies. Systems of classification, which operate within a power asymmetrical social hierarchy, necessarily embed and amplify historical and cultural prejudices, injustices, and biases [97]This paper just happened to be up on my screen, but if I had been keeping a file of these I could multiply examples.Everyone knows what this map is xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s the county-level presidential election results from 2016, colored by which party got the most votes. Itxe2x80x99s misleading because on looking at it, you wouldnxe2x80x99t know that Team Blue beat Team Redxe2x80x99s national vote count by two percentage points. But few could put a name to the problem with it, a very specific kind of lossy compression: quantization.The Wikipedia definition of quantization works well enough for our purposes:Quantization, involved in image processing, is a lossy compression technique achieved by compressing a range of values to a single quantum value. When the number of discrete symbols in a given stream is reduced, the stream becomes more compressible. For example, reducing the number of colors required to represent a digital image makes it possible to reduce its file size.The infamous red/blue map is literally an image compressed via quantization. The county-level data is quantized to one of two colors xe2x80x94 red or blue. Then the state-level data is further quantized to those same two colors. Every state gets one bit of information; the entire American political landscape is rendered in just 6.25 bytes.This map is contentious precisely because of its role in our red vs. blue power struggle, as a way of elevating some voices and silencing others. As such, it's a remarkable example of the main point I'm trying to make in this post: the act of extracting a limited feature set from a natural paradigm, and then representing those higher-value features in a cultural product of some kind, is always about power on some level.Yet again, none of this is novel or deep. In fact, I'm going over some really ancient ground with all this. (More on the antiquity of much of this material in a later post.)At this point, I should briefly circle back to the precise technical issue that precipitated the LeCun v. Gebru dustup. Herexe2x80x99s the image that sparked the conflict:June 20th 2020On the left is a quantized picture of Obama, the output of a lossy compression algorithm much like the one that produced the red/blue map. And on the right is the result of applying a new depixelation algorithm called PULSE to that quantized image. PULSExe2x80x99s goal is to reverse the effects of quantization by adding back the information lost to compression. In theory, this could produce the effect you get in sci-fi shows, where the guy says xe2x80x9cComputer, enhance!xe2x80x9d and the grainy image is magically clear. Except in this case, Computer did a racism.How does PULSE take a low-information image and fill back in the data lost in the process of quantization? The only way it would be possible for the algorithm to fill anything close to the original data lost in that specific image of Obama, is if it had been trained on a dataset of Obama photos. Then it could use its internal representation of Obamaxe2x80x99s face to fill in something close to the missing pixels. But PULSE wasnxe2x80x99t trained that way. It was trained on a dataset dominated by white guy faces, so random white guy face data is what it used to fill the information gaps in Obamaxe2x80x99s picture. The result is the face of a real-life black president morphed into the likeness of a computer-generated white guy who doesnxe2x80x99t actually exist.LeCun pointed out that the xe2x80x9cwhite Obamaxe2x80x9d image is surely the fault of the white-guy-centric training data. But from there he got piled on by people insisting that no, algorithms like PULSE can be and often are racially biased, and that it was blame-shifting and a dodge for LeCun to chalk these results up to the dataset alone. Yet despite all the yelling and name-calling, nobody ever refuted LeCun by actually showing how PULSE was biased independent of its training data. Indeed, the few examples of the-bias-is-in-the-models that were referenced all fit the same pattern: corner cases tossed out by lossy compression. In other words, they were examples of places where a model emphasized the more common features of the dataset, and de-emphasized the less common features.Indeed, in all the time I've spent so far with the AI Ethics literature, it seems to me that what Gebru et al are calling xe2x80x9cmodel biasxe2x80x9d is nothing other than the power dynamic I outlined above in the section on representation and compression.Ixe2x80x99ve yet to find an example of alleged model bias that does not fit this pattern.The other point thatxe2x80x99s always stressed in the AI Ethics literature, is that in the hands of large, powerful, status-quo-defining entities like Google, there's a feedback loop: the models are released back into the real world, where they tend to reinforce in some way the very status quo that produced them.This circularity of status quo => model => status quo is well covered in Cathy O'Neil's 2016 book, Weapons of Math Destruction. O'Neill is mostly concerned with the models used by Big Finance, but the principle is exactly the same xe2x80x94 models don't just reflect the status quo, they're increasingly critical to perpetuating it. Or, to borrow words from the title of an even earlier book on financial models by Donald MacKenzie, these models are \"an engine, not a camera.\"Unless I've missed something major, a very big chunk of the AI Ethics work amounts to stating and restating the age-old truth that big, costly, public representations of the regnant social hierarchy are powerful perpetuators of that very hierarchy. That's it. That's the tweet... and the paper... and the conference... and the discipline.In the formulation of Gebru's paper, large language models (xe2x80x9clargexe2x80x9d because theyxe2x80x99re trained on a massive, unsanitized corpus of texts from the wilds of the internet) re-present, or \"parrot,\" the problematic linguistic status quo. And in parroting it, they can perpetuate it.As people in positions of privilege with respect to a societyxe2x80x99s racism, misogyny, ableism, etc., tend to be overrepresented in training data for LMs (as discussed in xc2xa74 above), this training data thus includes encoded biases, many already recognized as harmful...In this section, we have discussed how the human tendency to attribute meaning to text, in combination with large LMsxe2x80x99 ability to learn patterns of forms that humans associate with various biases and other harmful attitudes, leads to risks of real-world harm, should LM-generated text be disseminated.1As someone who trained as an historian, it's not at all surprising to me that what was true of the Roman Colosseum xe2x80x94 in everything from the class-stratified seating arrangement to the central spectacle xe2x80x94 is also true of a the massively complex and expensive public display of cultural power that is Google's language model.Source: Daniel LongTo return to our printed page metaphor, the page itself is a hierarchy: the content in the pagexe2x80x99s main body is centered because the publisher thinks that the market valuexe2x80x99s the authorxe2x80x99s voice, and the content in the margins is de-centered because the publisher thinks those marginal voices have less value. Furthermore, the very selection and arrangement of ideas and words in the main body reflects what the author herself thinks is important.So anyone who includes that printed page in their training data is already starting with a multilevel hierarchy of (usually status-quo) values and assumptions that reflects which authors and ideas get elevated and which get suppressed. The AI Ethics crowd, then, is surely correct that the bias is everywhere in society at all levels. And theyxe2x80x99re right to point out that because the data at the margins of the page (or in the long tail of the dataset) often reflects larger social hierarchies, then algorithms with lossy compression characteristics (i.e., most of them) will amplify the center and silence the margins. But LeCun is also right that this societal bias is reflected in the training data. Furthermore, LeCun is also fully aware of the points the AI ethicists are making about bias being everywhere, but fixing the xe2x80x9ceverywherexe2x80x9d isnxe2x80x99t his lifexe2x80x99s work; so, he takes it on the chin from people whose lifexe2x80x99s work it is. But wexe2x80x99ll return to LeCun at the end of this post.If youxe2x80x99re an AI ethicist whose political project is all about elevating the voices at the margins of the page, then the margin-crushing realities of lossy compression present you with the following options:Separation: Train the model on a utopian dataset thatxe2x80x99s carefully constructed to represent your decolonized vision of a fully equitable world. Definitionally, this fully sanitized dataset would not at all represent the problematic, status-quo-organized world of present-day reality.Mitigation: All the proposed mitigation strategies I've seen so far amount to either tweaking the dataset, or to installing into the models some kind of privileged training mechanism via which you can side-load those marginal voices into the model to ensure they're represented. Benchmarks and auditing are a big part of this approach, and are worthy of a separate post. (Please send links if you have them!)Revolution: Hitch some cables to these large models and topple them. And then graffiti them and dump them in a nearby body of water.The first option is impossible to recommend to a large, capitalist enterprise like Google. Their models are used by normie customers out there in the normie world, so they have to reflect some amount of (problematic, colonized) normie reality. That's just how it is.The second option has been and is still being actively pursued by some AI Ethics folks, including Gebru, herself. Technically, itxe2x80x99s quite doable, and in fact business realities at Google and elsewhere already dictate that it be done for certain types of highly profitable corner cases (therexe2x80x99s gold in the margins of many commercial datasets). It's a tough road, though, to push for this mitigation to be done purely in the name of social justice, because it involves tradeoffs that will hurt the bottom line. Social justice is only pursued when itxe2x80x99s safe and, ideally, profitable.Given that option 2 is less effective than option 1, yet it's almost as hard as option 1 to make a real business case for, I've seen where some of the AI Ethics folks are looking to option 3, which we might also call \"Abolish AI.\"December 12th 2020Gebruxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cStochastic Parrotsxe2x80x9d paper flirts with this conclusion, raising the question of whether these large language models are too big to exist, given that we can't effectively massage and tweak the bias out them.Ixe2x80x99ll wrap this up by revisiting the original way I framed the disagreement between LeCun and Gebru: is the bias confined to the dataset, or is it everywhere, including in the models, themselves?Plot twist: This two-sided framing Ixe2x80x99ve been working with for this whole post is actually the AI Ethics crewxe2x80x99s framing xe2x80x94 it does not at all represent LeCunxe2x80x99s view, nor does it represent the views of any real ML person Ixe2x80x99ve been able to identify. It is in its own way a quantization and a rhetorical bid for power. Herexe2x80x99s what LeCun actually thinks about the issue of bias in ML models:June 22nd 2020If you read that thread, youxe2x80x99ll see that LeCun seems well aware of everything Ixe2x80x99ve laid out in this post, and has a richly nuanced view of this AI bias issue. Yet the AI Ethics people attack him for simplistic views he does not hold, and I wonder if theyxe2x80x99ve done so because theyxe2x80x99ve looked at his profile picture, quantized him down to something barely recognizable, and then filled back in the lost pixels out of their own mental model of a stereotypical clueless white guy.In quantizing and then depixelating LeCun in this hostile manner, it seems theyxe2x80x99ve transformed the face of a real-life ally into that of an enemy who doesnxe2x80x99t actually exist.Let's go a little further into the technical weeds by returning to Hooker's thread on models and bias. As we go through the papers she links reveals the lossy compression dynamic I've already described xe2x80x94 the center of the page is preserved, and the margins suffer xe2x80x94 is at work in every one of them.In the first paper she links, Characterising Bias in Compressed Models, the conclusion is that reducing the size of the neural network by pruning its weights doesn't affect its performance on the most common types of features in the dataset, but it does degrade performance on underrepresented features.If the model is trained to categorize face types, and the underrepresented features in question are the faces of some groups that make up a minority of the population (and hence a minority of a representative dataset), then compressing the model makes it worse at categorizing those types of faces.This is classic lossy compression: the page is preserved at the expense of the marginalia.The second paper, What Do Compressed Deep Neural Networks Forget?, goes in in the same vein. It finds that applying compression techniques to deep neural networks doesn't harm the page, but it does harm the margins. They write, \"Compressed networks appear to cannibalize performance on a small subset of classes in order to preserve overall top-line metrics (and even improve the relative performance on a narrow set of classes)\".\"Again, performance on corner cases and atypical examples suffers, while performance on more common features is preserved.In the next tweet, another paper's authors develop a way of scoring dataset features by how exceptional or regular they are in the context of that dataset. Features that are more exceptional are found to be learned later in the neural net's training, while more common, regular features are learned earlier.While this paper doesn't explicitly try to connect with any notions of fairness or bias, Hooker concludes from it that stopping a net's training earlier will impact its performance on these corner case features. Stopping early isn't quite the same as compression, but insofar as it's done in the service of economy of resources, and the outcome is the same, the same dynamic is at work.The penultimate tweet in this thread contains a paper that examines the impact of a privacy-preserving technique (differential privacy) on neural networks. Just recently, a Korean relationship advice chatbot was found to have memorized and to be leaking the details of the private, sensitive chats it was trained on. DP techniques are aimed at preventing that sort of leakage, but the tradeoff is that the network performs worse on the dataset.At this point, you'll be unsurprised to learn that this performance reduction doesn't apply to all the parts of the dataset equally. As always, the corner cases and outliers suffer at the expense of the more popular features.Now, I may be misreading Sarah Hooker's work in this section, so I do hope for correction if I'm getting this wrong. I reached out to her about an interview for this, but never heard back. However, I don't think my take is unreasonable, because Vitaly Feldman, whose paper Hooker cites in her last tweet, had the exact same reaction to her thread that I did:February 15th 2021And moving further afield from Hooker's thread, a recent paper from Gebru's Resistance AI Workshop, Decoding and Diversity in Machine Translation, finds that \"search can amplify socially problematic biases in the data, as has been observed in machine translation of gender pronouns.\" Essentially, the gender that's mentioned more frequently in the training data is often the one the MT algorithm will produce, which often messes up the translation in places where the gender it picked is wrong.Following this thread even further back to these same authors' earlier, related work, \"Reducing Gender Bias in Neural Machine Translation as a Domain Adaptation Problem,\" you can see in this paper where again they highlight dataset issues. Always the same story: the page is preserved, while the margins are either mangled are cropped.Natural language training data inevitably reflects biases present in our society. For example, gender bias manifests itself in training data which features more examples of men than of women. Tools trained on such data will then exhibit or even amplify the bi- ases (Zhao et al., 2017). Gender bias is a particularly important problem for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) into gender- inflected languages. An over-prevalence of some gendered forms in the training data leads to trans- lations with identifiable errors (Stanovsky et al., 2019).I could go on and on and on with these papers, but at this point you get the idea. The same fundamental lossy compression of center-vs-periphery comes up repeatedly in different types of representational systems, at different levels of complexity, and on different layers of abstraction.xe2x80x9cOn the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?xe2x80x9d, section 6.2For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Google's Colosseum - doxa","url":"https://doxa.substack.com/p/googles-colosseum"}

I tried to back some of those opinions up with predictions about what would happen during his administration. Now that the dust has cleared, it's time to see how I did.The summary: Of 48 specific predictions about Trump, I got 37 directionally right, although this is kind of meaningless. I got an average log error score of -0.48 (where getting everything right is 0 and guessing 50-50 for everything is -0.69) although this is also kind of meaningless. I quadrupled my money on prediction markets, which I think is meaningful. In terms of my more qualitative/implied predictions, got at least one important trend right before anyone else, but also made some embarrassing unforced errors.Going through all my predictions post by post, and giving each a letter grade:1: 10-23-2015: Trump's base is/will be surprisingly racially diverse (A-)As far as I know, the first post I wrote about Trump was this one, where I argued against the prevailing narrative that Trump was practicing \"the politics of white insecurity\" or had an unusually white base of support (for a Republican). I wrote that Trump seemed to be doing pretty well (for a Republican) among blacks and Hispanics, and concluded that:There are too few data to say anything for sure. But all of the data that exist suggest that if the Republican primary were held today and restricted to non-whites, Trump would still win. And if Trump were the Republican nominee, he could probably count on equal or greater support from minorities as Romney or McCain before him. In other words, the media narrative that Trump is doing some kind of special appeal-to-white-voters voodoo is unsupported by any polling data.I was right. In the general election a year later, Trump did better than Romney had among non-white voters. He made large gains among blacks, Asians, and Latinos. The only ethnic group where he didn't gain at least five percentage points over Romney's numbers was whites. As I pointed out at the time, the narrative that Trump was especially appealing to white voters was bizarre and not truth-based, motivated primarily by a demand for racist Republicans on the part of increasingly woke narrative-consumers.In the 2020 election, it became standard consensus that \"people of color\", though still heavily majority-Democrat, were surprisingly willing to vote Trump. But everyone acted like this was some unpredictable freak occurrence of the 2020 election; in fact the change started in 2016 or even earlier, as these graphs show. Everyone was just too stuck in their Trump = whiteness narrative to notice it.Normally I would give myself an A+ on this prediction, but the post went on to take some digs at Bernie Sanders for actually having a disproportionately white support base. This was true in 2015 - 2016, but he picked up a lot of minority support over the next few years, and going into 2020 his base was as diverse as anybody else's. I don't think I was really making a prediction here, but insofar as I was, it was falsified. So overall I will give this post an A-.2: 1-27-16: Trump will win the primaries but lose the general (and other predictions) (D+)In my yearly predictions thread, I made a couple of Trump-related predictions:21. Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination: 60%22* Conditional on Trump winning the Republican nomination, he impresses everyone how quickly he pivots towards wider acceptability: 70%23. Conditional on Trump winning the Republican nomination, hexe2x80x99ll lose the general election: 80%24. Conditional on Trump winning the Republican nomination, hexe2x80x99ll lose the general election worse than either McCain or Romney: 70%Prediction 21 - I'm proud of this one. It looks like the betting markets only gave Trump a 32% chance around the same time, so I was more willing to entertain a Trump primary victory. A.Prediction 22 was obviously not at all true. He won the Republican nomination and continued being as bizarre and offensive as ever. I must have been really sure about this one - I had no need to express an opinion on this, but it was one of four Trump-related things I chose to predict about, so I suck. F.Prediction 23: I can't find anyone else giving conditional odds for Trump. The betting markets gave 14% unconditional odds but I don't think I can derive conditional odds from that. Still, other people were saying 99% odds Trump would lose as late as November 2016, so I wasn't the worst person here. C.Prediction 24: Also clearly not true and I suck. F.Overall these numbers reveal I was blindsided by Trump's victory as much as everyone else. Still, since I know how to use probabilities and not be insanely overconfident, the worst you can say about me is that I gave 20% probability to a true event, which isn't so bad. Overall grade for this section is D+.3: 9-28-2016: Trump will cause various bad consequences and you shouldn't vote for him (B-)In SSC Endorses Clinton, Johnson, Or Stein I wrote about my reasons for opposing Trump. There's a lot in here and I'll try to extract relevant-prediction-shaped things - but be sure to read the post to see how honest you think I'm being in my extractions.I started by arguing that Trump's brand of conservativism was an expression of policy-less rage against all existing institutions. I suggested people not vote Trump because destroying all existing institutions without a plan to replace them historically has gone poorly.Although I think the xe2x80x9cexpression of ragexe2x80x9d idea of Trump still makes sense, realistically he didn't destroy that many institutions. He just filled positions with unusually-corrupt but otherwise standard conservatives, and spent most of his time tweeting. I think my argument that you shouldn't vote for Trump because he would violently destroy useful institutions ended up kind of falling flat. D.Next, I wrote:Trump isnxe2x80x99t a known quantity. Maybe hexe2x80x99ll kind of dodder around and be kind of funny while not changing much. Or maybe there will be some crisis and Trump will take what could have been a quickly-defused diplomatic incident and turn it into World War III.This hedged hard, but I think looks good in retrospect. Trump mostly doddered around without changing much. But his order to assassinate Iranian general Qasem Soleimani - which by my understanding was kind of a decoy out-of-range extreme plan his generals suggested only to make their other plans sound more reasonable - was exactly the sort of potentially-WWIII-causing blunder I worried about. In this case Iran decided it wasn't worth picking a fight, but that was their good decision, not Trump's. I realize this is sort of sketchy; I'm declaring a thing which empirically went well to unobservably be a massive blunder, then counting my prediction of massive blunders right. But based on my sincere assessment of the Soleimani situation, I feel more honest doing this than not doing it. B.Moving on:Remember also that itxe2x80x99s more likely the House and Senate both stay Republican than that they both switch to being Democrat. So if Hillary is elected, shexe2x80x99ll probably spend four years smashing her head against Congress; if Trump is elected, he will probably get a lot of what he wants.The House and Senate were both Republican for Trump's first two years, after which the House became Democratic. But Trump still managed to get surprisingly little of what he wanted, even assuming \"want\" is a coherent emotion to attribute to him. D.Therexe2x80x99s a vicious cycle where the lack of intelligent conservatives guts the system of think tanks that produce the sort of studies and analyses which convince smart people to become conservative, which in turn makes there even fewer intelligent conservatives, and so on. In the end, intellectuals wonxe2x80x99t just vote Democrat; theyxe2x80x99ll shift their personal views further to the left to fit in.\"I think this basically happened. See eg Trump: A Setback For Trumpism. A.One more warning for conservatives who still arenxe2x80x99t convinced. If the next generation is radicalized by Trump being a bad president, theyxe2x80x99re not just going to lean left. Theyxe2x80x99re going to lean regressive, totalitarian, super-social-justice left.I think this basically happened. A.4: 10-01-2016: Trump will be more of a warmonger than his supporters expect (D+)In He Kept Us Out Of War?, I argued that despite the perception of Trump as the anti-imperialism, anti-military-action president, hopes that he would wind down global empire and avoid further military action were misplaced.Yet Trump can honestly claim to be the first president since Carter not to start a new conflict. He didn't really do much to wind down US global empire, but it seemed like maybe he was half-heartedly trying and Congress just thwarted him.I think my basic argument here had some okay points. I predicted Trump would escalate and complete the fight against ISIS, and was right.  I said Trump was a loose cannon who might start a war for stupid reasons, and I think the Soleimani assassination was almost this. But overall, I have to admit that his supporters were mostly right about this one and I was mostly wrong.5: 11-16-2016: Trump won't be explicitly and openly white supremacist / wonxe2x80x99t openly support the KKK etc / won't pursue especially racist policies (A)You Are Still Crying Wolf was my most-read post ever, getting retweeted by everyone up to and including Ann Coulter. I expanded on my original argument about Trump not getting especially strong white support to argue that the racial narrative around Trump was kind of bunk. This attracted a lot of debate, so I'm going to go into more depth about it than some of the other things here. I wrote this during a time when people were making extreme claims about Trumpxe2x80x99s purported racial policies. Matt Yglesias (then at Vox) wrote that xe2x80x9cMy guess is in a Trump administration angry mobs will beat and murder Jews and people of color with impunityxe2x80x9d. Jamelle Bouie (of Slate) agreed and said we were on the edge of xe2x80x9cstate-sanctioned racial violencexe2x80x9d. Salon literally wrote an article called If Trump Wins, Say Goodbye To Your Black Friends (it was subtitled xe2x80x9cA Modest Proposalxe2x80x9d, but my impression is the joking part was the suggestion to build a black separatist nation in Atlanta). Vox wrote about how minority kids believed they would be forced to leave the country; therapists were called in to help Muslim kids who believed Trump was going to kill them.The news was full of lurid stories about Trump supporters being violent and hateful. The Atlantic described how a black church was set on fire and spray painted with xe2x80x9cVote Trumpxe2x80x9d; there was a wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers; a Trump supporter threatened to set on fire an Ann Arbor student who was wearing a Muslim headscarf (I was a psychiatrist in Ann Arbor at the time and had to deal with the wave of fear that swept through the community after this). These incidents fed into the general mood of panic.The consensus take on all of this was that Trump was an xe2x80x9copen white supremacistxe2x80x9d in league with the KKK, who fanned and supported all of these incidents.I wrote a post stating that the Trump administration would not feature angry mobs killing minorities with impunity, would not feature state-sanctioned racial violence, would not feature an especially large number of hate crimes, and would not feature the state supporting and refusing to prosecute hate crimes. I said Trump was not an xe2x80x9copenxe2x80x9d white supremacist and probably not a white supremacist at all except in whatever boring way you can call anyone who isnxe2x80x99t super-woke a white supremacist. I said that he was not getting especially high support from white voters, that he was doing better with voters of color than other Republicans, and that attempts to paint his base as especially white were bad statistics. I tried to make it very clear that this was trying to be a low-scope pushback against these particular claims, and not some sort of generic screen in favor of Trump. I gave my thesis as:There is no evidence that Donald Trump is more racist  than any past Republican candidate (or any other 70 year old white guy,  for that matter). All this stuff about how hexe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cthe candidate of the  KKKxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cthe vanguard of a new white supremacist movementxe2x80x9d is made up.  Itxe2x80x99s a catastrophic distraction from the dozens of other undeniable problems with Trump that could have convinced voters to abandon him.xe2x80xa6and tried to be as clear as possible by including disclaimers like xe2x80x9cI thought and still think a Trump presidency will be a disasterxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m not saying Trump doesnxe2x80x99t have some racist  attitudes and policies. I am saying that talk of xe2x80x98entire campaign built  around white supremacyxe2x80x99 and xe2x80x98the white power candidatexe2x80x99 is deliberate  and dangerous exaggeration.xe2x80x9dI think time has proven me right here. There was no large-scale state-sponsored violence against minorities during the Trump presidency. Trumpxe2x80x99s race-related policies were similar to those of other recent Republican presidents. The three most-discussed Trump supporter hate crimes all turned out to be hoaxes (1, 2, 3, I swear Ixe2x80x99m not trying to cherry-pick, these really were the most discussed incidents at the time). There was no huge spike in hate crimes during the Trump presidency, just fluctuations of about the same scale as during previous years. The much-reported-upon study showing that Trump rallies increased local hate crimes was reanalyzed and found to be wrong; adjusting for population correctly showed they did not increase hate crimes at all. Trump lost support among white voters, and gained support among voters of color at an unprecedented rate among Republicans. The KKK and Richard Spencer did not play a major role in the Trump administration, and the media stopped covering them in favor of new, less-racialized pro-Trump groups like QAnon.Ixe2x80x99m hammering this in because people were awful to me after I wrote that post. Every time anything bad happened involving race, I would get dozens of angry tweets saying xe2x80x9clooks like we finally have proof that Scott Alexander is a pro-Nazi idiotxe2x80x9d and a link back to my post. Even when things completely unrelated to race happened, people would do this. When the Capitol riots happened, with basically no links to organized white supremacy and ~15% of the rioters being people of color, after I hadnxe2x80x99t been blogging for six months, I still had people sending me messages about how this destroyed the last shred of my credibility or something. This was the most hate Ixe2x80x99ve ever gotten about any post of mine and it was terrible. I promised some of these people at the time that I would respond to them later, in depth, after the administration was over, so here goes.I included some explicit predictions as a test of my hypothesis. Some of these predictions might seem so obvious that I shouldn't get credit for them. But again, I wrote them a week after Trump was elected, in the middle of a national panic, when people were freaking out. Trump was the KKK president! There were white supremacist militias marching on the Capitol steps! Minorities should consider fleeing the country! I was trying to come up with things to predict that corresponded to \"your national panic is dumb\", and here's what I came up with, plus how Ixe2x80x99m grading them:1. Total hate crimes incidents as measured here will be not more than 125% of their 2015 value at any year during a Trump presidency, conditional on similar reporting methodology [confidence: 80%]Incorrect. I originally judged this one as correct, but a commenter noted an error in my math - in 2019, hate crimes reached 125.03% of their pre-Trump value. See here for an argument that reporting methodology changed in an important way that pushed this over the top, but absent proof of this I will default to saying I was wrong.2. Total minority population of US citizens will increase throughout Trumpxe2x80x99s presidency [confidence: 99%]Correct, not that anyone should be surprised by this.3. US Muslim population increases throughout Trumpxe2x80x99s presidency [confidence: 95%]Probably also correct - but I can't find any statistics proving this, so skip. In retrospect 95% confidence was way too low for this and I must have been at least a little caught up in the panic I was trying to argue against.4. Trump cabinet will be at least 10% minority [confidence: 90%], at least 20% minority [confidence: 70%], at least 30% minority [30%]. Here Ixe2x80x99m defining xe2x80x9cminorityxe2x80x9d to include nonwhites, Latinos, and LGBT people, though not women. Note that by this definition America as a whole is about 35% minority and Congress is about 15% minority.Incorrect. Based on this source, of 33 original Cabinet members, 3 were minorities, which is 9%. My weakest prediction -  that at least a tenth would be minorities - was wrong, and obviously every stronger prediction was wrong too. I failed at a 90% prediction and am appropriately ashamed.5. Gay marriage will remain legal throughout a Trump presidency [confidence: 95%]Correct, not that anyone should have been surprised by this. This is another one where in retrospect I was massively underconfident. 6. Race relations as perceived by blacks, as measured by this Gallup poll, will do better under Trump than they did under Obama (ie the change in race relations 2017-2021 will be less negative/more positive than the change 2009-2016) [confidence: 70%].Indeterminate. I originally judged this correct, but commenters pointed out that this hinged on the numbers for 2017, a year in which Gallup did not take a poll. Interpolating 2017 as halfway between 2016 and 2018 results in this prediction being correct, but commenters seemed to think this was sufficiently unfair that I will shift it to indeterminate.7. Neither Trump nor any of his officials (Cabinet, etc) will endorse the KKK, Stormfront, or explicit neo-Nazis publicly, refuse to back down, etc, and keep their job [confidence: 99%].Correct.8. No large demographic group (> 1 million people) get forced to sign up for a xe2x80x9cregistryxe2x80x9d [confidence: 95%]Correct.9 No large demographic group gets sent to internment camps [confidence: 99%]Correct.10. Number of deportations during Trumpxe2x80x99s four years will not be greater than Obamaxe2x80x99s 8 [confidence: 90%]Correct. In fact, I should have been more extreme here - Trump deported fewer people during his first four years than Obama did during his first four years!Overall I got 6 of these predictions right, 2 wrong, and 2 indeterminate.I also promised some of the people questioning me about this a response to more specific points - especially about Trumpxe2x80x99s comments, and his support (or lack thereof) from white supremacists. This will be long and annoying and the rest of you should just skip to my next prediction, but here you go:Comments: Part of my argument was that people were interpreting innocuous or stupid comments by Trump as endorsements of racism, Nazis, and the KKK. An implicit prediction of this was that, once Trump was President for a while and we had a much larger sample size of his comments, it would become clearer that he wasn't explicitly expressing support for racism.In retrospect, this is a hard implicit prediction to grade. Suppose you're arguing against UFOlogists who point to grainy photos with vague splotches in the sky as evidence of aliens. You say \"The future will prove me right!\". Then the future comes, and a UFOlogist triumphantly shoves a new grainy photo of a sky splotch at you and says \"Look! Time has only provided further proof of how many aliens there are.\" Of course if you disagreed about how to interpret current data, you should expect to run into the same problems about future data.During Trump's presidency, I noticed two comments that people frequently held up as evidence for his explicit racism or pro-Nazi views.In practice, the main post-election comment everyone holds up as Trump Explicitly Saying Nazis Are Good was his post-Charlottesville comment, where he said that there were \"good people on both sides\" of a protest that included alt-right figures. What actually happened: Trump said that \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.\" Later he said of the protesters that \"You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides\". When asked to clarify he said \"Ixe2x80x99m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists -- because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.\"So Trump specifically condemned neo-Nazis and white nationalists, then said that - although he definitely was not talking about neo-Nazis and white nationalists, there were some good people in the protest. In the exact sort of UFO-splotch-pareidolia I had originally complained about, this somehow turned into a universal agreement that Trump had said neo-Nazis and white nationalists were good people.Might there still be a case against Trump, on the grounds that all Charlottesville protesters were neo-Nazis and white nationalists and Trump surely knew this and was just dog whistling by pretending some weren't? No - in fact, there were many non-neo-Nazi protesters there - the New York Times did an interview with one of them (CTRL+F \"Michelle Piercy\"). This is just a total refusal to care what Trump actually said, combined with lies to make the deliberate misrepresentation sound defensible. It's exactly the sort of willful misreading that I complained about in my post.The second comment that people read as Trump endorsing neo-Nazis was his supposed refusal to condemn white supremacy during his debate with Biden. Here's the transcript:WALLACE: Are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups?TRUMP: SureWALLACE: And to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha, and as wexe2x80x99ve seen in PortlandTRUMP: Sure, Ixe2x80x99m prepared to do it, but I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right-wing. Ixe2x80x99m willing to do anything, I want to see peace.WALLACE: Then do it, sir.BIDEN: Do it, say it.TRUMP: What do you want to call them? Give me a name.WALLACE: White supremacists and right-wing militias.BIDEN: Proud Boys.TRUMP: Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But Ixe2x80x99ll tell you what, somebodyxe2x80x99s got to do something about Antifa and the left.When asked to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, Trump immediately said \"Sure\". Wallace asked if he was willing to tell these groups to stand down. Trump said yes. Wallace kept pushing him in a way suggesting he wanted a message targeted at a specific group. Trump asked who specifically who specifically Wallace was asking him to say should stand down. Wallace started to say \"white supremacists\", but Biden interrupted with \"Proud Boys\". Trump said the Proud Boys should \"stand back and stand by\", which as far as I can tell is equivalent to \"stand down\", the specific thing Wallace kept trying to make him say even though he had already condemned everybody.I'm trying as hard as I can to be charitable - maybe people thought Trump should have followed Wallace's exact wording and said \"Stand down\" instead of the more temporary-sounding \"Stand back and stand by\"? Or maybe they got confused by the crosstalk between Wallace and Biden, and thought Trump should have said this to white supremacists in particular (a third time) instead of to the Proud Boys? But it's really hard for me to come up with a narrative where someone trying to comprehend this honestly could see it as Trump endorsing the white supremacists who he had already condemned just seconds before.Apparently these two events were the most racist-sounding comments anyone was able to get out of Trump in four years of being President. And they're pathetic. The slightest attempt to read the transcripts of what he was actually saying makes it super clear how pathetic they are. I think my implied prediction that Trump wouldn't make especially racist comments during his presidency proved correct.I also think events proved me right in saying that the media was going crazy in a particular way where they would read racism into anything.   During the Trump administration, we got stories about how Trump watching fireworks at Mt. Rushmore meant he was \"glorifying white supremacy\", about how Bill de Blasio was blaming the Jews for coronavirus, and about how Pete Buttigeg was \"openly racist\" and riding a tide of \"white supremacy\". Elizabeth Warren is a fascist who supports ethnic cleansing, the Boy Scouts have effectively become a fascist youth group, JK Rowling is aligned with white supremacists, etc. And don't forget the stories about how a prison guard's tattoo secretly encoded white supremacist symbols (it ended up being his college football uniform number), that the number of words in Homeland Security documents could be interpreted as a white supremacist code, or that Melania Trump had secretly encoded the letters \"KKK\"   into the new design for the White House Rose Garden (for a totally   different conspiracy that the new Rose Garden encodes Nazi symbology, see here). At some point you just have to admit everyone went crazy for a few years and seeing started seeing Nazis in trees and rocks and grilled cheese sandwiches and Trump was an especially tempting target.    Policies: In my post I specifically exempted immigration - I thought Trump was likely to pursue unusually anti-immigrant policies and said so at the time - but said that otherwise Trump wouldn't pursue any explicitly or openly racist policies, and that in fact his racial policies would be bog-standard for a Republican. As far as I can tell this was basically true. He seems to have done relatively well for himself with eg prison reform. He responded to the George Floyd killing by condemning it, signing an executive order pushing police reform, and expressing support for ending chokeholds by police. I'm not aware of any non-immigration race-related policies he pushed that were especially controversial.Racist supporters: Around the 2016 election, there were a lot of stories about the KKK marching for Trump, about how arch-alt-rightist Richard Spencer was leading white nationalists in Nazi salutes for Trump, et cetera. We were promised an age of renewed white supremacist activity, supported by or maybe actively merging with the government.Needless to say, none of that happened. White supremacist activity in the United States never went beyond normal levels. After Charlottesville, the media tried to convince everyone that this was the promised spike in white supremacist activity, but it wasn't: there had been a bunch of white supremacist rallies larger than the Charlottesville protest throughout the Clinton, Bush, and Obama presidencies - the media just hadn't signal-boosted them as hard. 500 Nazis rallied at Lake Tahoe in 1996; 125 at Yorktown in 2005; 2000 in Budapest in 2009. Charlottesville's couple hundred were kind of par for the course - and all of these numbers are around the same number of people who eg attend Satanist rallies. After Charlottesville there were no further large white supremacist rallies, with an attempted Charlottesville II attracting about 20-30 people.Further, white supremacists generally stopped being interested in Donald Trump, and have mostly abandoned him. In 2018, Southern Poverty Law Center wrote Are White Nationalists Turning On Trump? - by now, the answer is clearly yes. From VOA News: Once Ardent Trump Supporters, White Nationalists Splinter Ahead Of Presidential Vote. Richard Spencer, who invented the term \"alt-right\" and whose Trump salute helped spark the panic, disavowed Trump in early 2020 and announced he was supporting Biden in the election. White supremacists are irrelevant and you should not care what they think, but if for some reason you insist on caring what they think, they are no longer particularly pro-Trump.At the same time, Trump's support among people of color has grown significantly. Although (as mentioned before) the racial gap in partisan support was already starting to close in 2016, this accelerated throughout Trump's presidency, with 2020 Trump getting the most black and Latino votes of any modern Republican candidate. Trump also significantly lost ground with white voters.I think this is probably the clearest indicator I can come up with for whether or not my prediction has proven true. Trump lost the support of white supremacists, lost the support of whites in general, and gained support from minorities. This picture is consistent with people of all races not viewing him as conducting an especially pro-white or anti-minority Presidency.Overall I give myself an A on this prediction, and am delighted to have outlasted all the people who hated that post and kept trying to convince me it \"wasn't aging well\" or whatever. (Ann Coulter still sucks though). I will still never predict anything this controversial again - itxe2x80x99s not worth the cost to my peace of mind.6: 01-04-2017: Trump will strong-arm people into giving him good photo ops, which will make him look successful (F)In Trump And The Batman Effect, I updated way too hard on Trump convincing a couple of companies to keep their jobs in the US during his first month after winning the election, and decided that Trump's overall plan for his presidency was to strong-arm specific people into doing a few good things and bask in the credit, while everything generally got worse all around him.In retrospect this wasn't a particularly coherent idea, and Trump didn't really do this. It was barely a month after Trump got elected and I think I was desperate to have some kind of Trump-related take that hadn't already been done to death. This was the best I could do, and in retrospect it was stupid. F.7: 1-2017 through 1-2020: Various predictions about the Trump administration over the next year (B)This is my dump for all my other yearly prediction threads. Ones that came true are left intact, ones that proved false are starred, ones that I wasn't able to judge are italicized:From 1/2017, about 1/2018:41.

Trump gets at least half the wall funding he wants from current shutdown: 20%15. Ginsberg still alive: 50%Are there any consistent patterns here?I underestimated how well the economy would do the past four years. I think this was less about underestimating Trump's economic leadership, and more about guessing the economy had nothing to do with the president but assuming it would cool down after a longish recovery under Obama. In fact it kept getting better and better. I'm a little nervous about this because the economy is one of the few gauges of a president's performance that has really objective indicators, and it did well under Trump, which is a little bit of evidence he might be more competent than I thought? But it's not very much evidence and for now I'll stick to my guess that it doesn't have much to do with the president and he got lucky.I overestimated the likelihood of Trump building the border wall, passing immigration reform, or otherwise delivering on his campaign promise to fight immigration. I think this was partly me overestimating his honesty and competence, and partly me partly falling victim to the panic about how Trump was about to deport all immigrants and only the #Resistance could stop him. Although I was able to partly resist that panic when writing my Crying Wolf post, I was less able to resist the immigrant-related piece of it and notice that Trump wasn't really competent / dedicated enough to accomplish anything here.8: 2-15-2018: Predictions on the next five years, especially the 2020 elections (C)As part of SSC's five year anniversary, I tried to predict the following five years. Three of those years have happened now. The Trump-relevant predictions were:The crisis of the Republican Party will turn out to have been overblown. Trumpxe2x80x99s policies have been so standard-Republican that there will be no problem integrating him into the standard Republican pantheon, plus or minus some concerns about his personality which will disappear once he personally leaves the stage. Some competent demagogue (maybe Ted Cruz or Mike Pence) will use some phrase equivalent to xe2x80x9ccompassionate Trumpismxe2x80x9d, everyone will agree it is a good idea, and in practice it will be exactly the same as what Republicans have been doing forever. The party might move slightly to the right on immigration, but this will be made easy by a fall in corporate demand for underpriced Mexican farm labor, and might be trivial if therexe2x80x99s a border wall and they can declare mission accomplished. If the post-Trump standard-bearer has the slightest amount of personal continence, he should end up with a more-or-less united party who view Trump as a flawed but ultimately positive figure, like how they view GW Bush. Also, I predict we see a lot more of Ted Cruz than people are expecting.1. Trump wins 2020: 20%2. Republicans win Presidency in 2020: 40%Prediction 1 was directionally correct. Was it overconfident? It feels like I was overconfident to say only a 20% chance for Trump to win way back in 2018, when in fact Trump came kind of close. But my prediction on Election Night was still only about 20%, 538's model for most of the 2020 predicted about 20% or less, so I think this might have been just right.But Prediction 2 suggests I thought there was only a 50% chance Trump would win the Republican nomination. In retrospect that was way too low. I think I genuinely should feel embarrassed about this one - I put myself in the Republican Party's shoes and imagined I would reject Trump, ignoring all the evidence that actual Republicans liked him quite a lot and would probably continue to do so. The long paragraph sort of flips in and out of making that mistake. I think I was right that the Republican Party wouldn't have some crisis about whether or not to accept Trump. But I think I was predicting that would be because (the public image of) Trump would shift towards the Republican consensus. But in fact the Republican consensus moved towards Trump. I think I got the non-crisis right, but the way it happened wrong. The Republican Party has fundamentally changed to be a paranoid victimization-narrative-based party. Trump got there first, everyone else followed, and while the details can change I don't think they're going to flip back.I don't think we've seen any more of Ted Cruz than anyone expected.Overall I give this section a C.9: ~Autumn 2020 Semi-Prediction: QAnon was a moral panic and you should ignore it (D+)I'm listing this as a semi-prediction because I never actually made it; I took the blog down before I could say anything about this formally. You will just have to trust me that I believed this. Still, I believed it very hard, and it's worth doing a postmortem on.My argument was something like: QAnon are, for real, the sort of people that Democrats like to imagine all Republicans are. They're crazy and have no valid concerns. So Democrats had a very strong incentive to exaggerate their role within the Republican party and convince people that QAnon was the driving force behind Trump support. Nobody ever gave an estimate for how many people were in QAnon, and every report on it was consistent with \"a tiny handful\". There was also a big attempt to make QAnon look violent by everyone giving long lists of \"Violent Acts Caused By QAnon\", when you examined them closer, literally did not include a single violent act caused by QAnon (it was all either nonviolent acts, plots that never materialized, or criminals who were incidentally QAnon supporters). Later some people did a terrible mismanaged poll which purported to show that 35% of Republicans were QAnon supporters, and then someone did a better poll which showed 1-2% of Republicans were QAnon supporters. Everyone reported on the former, nobody reported on the latter, and this left me pretty annoyed.In ~November 2020, I did a survey of Twitter in which I searched the keyword \"QAnon\", and the most recent 100 results were all Democrats attacking QAnon; no matter how far I scrolled I could not find any actual QAnon supporters. But I don't know if this was because vocal QAnon opponents actually outnumbered QAnoners by that much, or because Twitter is doing a really good job censoring them (is it even possible to censor supporters using a keyword this successfully without opponents getting caught in the crossfire?) Either way, this added to my evidence that this was a pointless moral panic.But I've since come to count this as a mostly false prediction. The main thing was talking to a few patients and SSC commenters who said their family members strongly supported QAnon in ways that put serious strain on their families; since these are a semi-random sample of the population, that suggests it's pretty big (not necessarily bigger than the 1% to 2% of people in polls, but 1% to 2% of people being strong active supporters of a conspiracy theory is actually a relatively big deal. The Capitol riot didn't particularly make me update further on this, both because I had already updated, and because according to researchers only 8% of Capitol rioters were QAnon believers (although this was definitely the 8% with the most interesting fashion sense). This confirms to me that QAnon is a small minority, but not an irrelevantly small minority, of extreme Trump supporters. I also feel like it could have gotten worse/more important in a way that made it worth watching, although luckily in this timeline it seems to have at least partly imploded after Trump lost the presidency.I think it's plausible that QAnon was 1-8% of Trump supporters, which is much larger than I believed at the start, although still not as large as I felt like people were trying to make me think. Overall I judge this one a minor-to-medium failure, and give it a D+.10: ~Autumn 2020 Semi-Prediction: There will not be a Trump coup (B)Another one I never got the chance to say publicly, and you'll just have to trust that I was thinking it. My argument was basically the same as Maciej Ceglowski's argument here .I graded this one a B. A lot of people who did predict a coup took the Capitol riot as proof that they were right. I didn't see it this way, because, well, it wasn't a coup. When rioters got in the Capitol, Trump tweeted saying that they needed to stay peaceful, then released a video saying that this wasn't what he wanted and they should leave. I've read Edward Luttwak's guide to holding a coup, and telling your supporters \"stop and don't hold a coup\" is not in it. Actual coups involve interfacing with the military, friendly media, local police forces, etc and coordinating some kind of meaningful strike. Trump did none of that and was clearly not capable of it. Trump's plan, as far as it's worth dignifying with that term, was to challenge the election results a lot, and get a bunch of angry supporters to chant outside the Capitol in a scary way while senators were voting on it. This is evil, anti-democratic, and terrifying, but not a coup. When his plan for angry supporters chanting turned into angry supporters rioting and getting into the Capitol, he was clearly against this and tried to stop it. While he is an idiot for not anticipating this possibility and deserves blame for it, I don't think it qualifies as a coup, and I think everyone who gave arguments for why an actual coup was unlikely were basically right.I did make a bet with someone who thought there would be a successful coup (eg Trump would remain president after January 20th despite losing the election), and won $100.Overall I give this one a B.11: Bonus - How much money did I make on prediction markets? (B+)During the 2016 - 2020 period, I quadrupled my money on PredictIt.I started using PredictIt during the 2016 election (I bet $20 on Hillary and obviously lost everything). After that I decided it would be fun to start with some seed amount and see what happened to it over time, so I put in another $200 and was a lot more careful with it. Over the course of a few dozen bets, I was able to turn my initial $220 into about $900 by the end of the 2020 election.I bet on a lot of things, but the ones where I put a lot of money in and really won big were:- Predicting that Marine Le Pen would not be elected President of France. A lot of people who overupdated on Trump and Brexit decided that polls didn't work anymore and the far-right would win no matter what the polls said, and they bought her up to a price much higher than her numbers justified. I decided Le Pen's polls were much worse than Trump or Brexit's and I was comfortable assuming the polls at least kind of reflected reality, so I bet against her and made about $100.- Predicting that the 1/2019 government shut down would last a long time. I figured there was more partisanship than ever before, neither Trump nor Congressional Democrats seemed like the sort of people who would back down, and so it was fair to take an Inside View and assume this shutdown would last longer than previous ones. I made another $150.- Predicting that Biden would win the Democratic nomination. I bought up a thousand shares of Biden for 16 cents a share in early 2019, which was an amazing move - then proceeded to screw it up in as many ways as possible. I wondered if maybe Sanders or Warren or O'Rourke would win, so I bought a bunch of them too. Then the one week when Warren was doing super-well, I panicked that I had missed out on the real winner and bought a lot of Warren, then sold her for really low again once she crashed. None of these mistakes were able to completely wipe out my gain from buying so much Biden so early, and I made another $200 or so.- Predicting that Biden (and the Democrats) would win the election. I kept buying this throughout 2020, on the basis of the spread between PredictIt (which gave Trump about 45% chance) and 538 and other top pundits (who gave Trump about 20% chance). This never stopped seeming like a good deal, so I just kept buying more and more of it as my other bets closed and more and more funds became available. I think I won about $200 on this, though it's complicated for me to say exactly how much because of the next point.- On Election Night 2020, after Trump started outperforming his polls, shares in Trump winning briefly reached 70 - 80%. Running the exact degree to which Trump was outperforming his polls through 538's model, I determined there was still only about a 20 - 30% chance he would win. I had originally planned to see how much I could make off my original investment alone, but this seemed so much like free money that I took out my credit card and put a few thousand more dollars on Biden. I won about $2000 off this. I can't count it in my official score because it wasn't part of the original investment, but I would have been really angry at myself if I hadn't done this.Along with these good bets, I lost a bit of money on some other bets, including Warren winning the nomination, a lot of speculating on Trump's exact number of tweets and various candidates' exact polling averages, and a disastrous assumption that surely they couldn't elect Binyamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel yet another time, could they?Looking over my history, I find that I did well when I was speculating on very high-level important events I'd been following closely, like who would win the election, and poorly on low-level things I tried to do math on, like how many times Trump would tweet in a given week. This is the opposite of what I originally expected - I'd thought more money and analysis would go into election predictions, and the small niche markets would be where you could eke out a gain. I think what probably happened is that the election markets attracted a lot of dumb money that I could beat, and the tweet markets were mostly semi-professional investors who were much better at mathematizing it than I was.Overall I approximately quadrupled my original $220 investment into about $900. I plan to take out all the money I won except about $1000 and see how much I end up with at the end of the first Biden administration.12: ConclusionIf I average out the grade I (unprincipledly) gave myself on each of the sections, I got a C. I tried to assign grades so that doing as well as an average pundit = a C, so I think I did about average.According to my own judgment, I usually did better on predictions about race, and worse on other things. An optimistic take on this is that race has become so emotionally charged that most people have kind of crazy beliefs about it, which makes them easier to beat. A pessimistic take is that race has become so emotionally charged that everyone including me has crazy beliefs, which makes me a more biased judge and lets me award myself points more shamelessly than I would do anywhere else. The few cases where we have objective numbers we can use to judge (eg the changing racial distribution of voters) pushes me more towards the optimistic view on this.I also seem to have done better on the prediction markets than in my letter grades and scored predictions. I think this is because the dumb money I bet against on prediction markets was dumber than the hypothetical \"average pundit\" I was grading myself against. Real pundits generally gave Trump 20% odds compared to prediction markets' 40% odds, so it was easier to beat the latter.Did my liberal bias lead me to underestimate Trump? I'm not sure. He did better than I expected on the economy and on not starting wars. But he did worse than I expected on getting any of his policies enacted. Maybe this is what I should expect if I was suffering from liberal bias - maybe the liberal narrative was \"Trump is an evil supervillain who will successfully complete all kinds of terrible things\", which made me underestimate how well Trump would do on things I liked, but overestimate how well he would do on things I hated. But I don't know if that was actually the liberal narrative - there was at least as much \"Trump is a completely incompetent buffoon.\" Overall I think the real Trump administration was in the 60th percentile of my pre-administration range of estimates of how bad it could be (where 0th is the best I could possibly imagine, and 100th is the worst I could possibly imagine) - but this is almost entirely because of the botched coronavirus response. In terms of non-coronavirus stuff it was probably the 20th percentile. I don't want to say this means \"I overestimated its badness\" because the botched coronavirus response was a real thing that happened, and part of the way I expected the Trump administration to be bad was to botch any crises it ended up in. Overall I don't think I found I had significant liberal bias.Did my less-liberal-than-a-lot-of-the-media bias lead me to overestimate Trump? I think no - I had a low enough opinion of him that it would have been hard for it to be an overestimate - but I might have overestimated his supporters. I somewhat misjudged the severity of QAnon, and I didn't expect not-originally-Trumpist Republicans to go over to him in the numbers they did.I think the biggest mistake I made was to expect Trump to be more competent (at achieving his own goals) than he was. Trump's winning the election was weird enough that I think everyone was flirting with Scott Adams' thesis that he was some kind of bizarre \"clown genius\" or \"drunken master\" type whose apparent bumbling was just him playing so many levels above the rest of us that we couldn't understand it. I think something like this might be true for his ability to speak to the Republican base, but it obviously didn't translate into politics, policy, or having any idea what to do with the Presidency. Possibly my underlying error here was overestimating the correlation between different types of intelligence - just because someone has figured out a weird drunken-master strategy for winning the hearts of conservatives doesn't mean he has any special talent at anything else. I think it took me a year or two to fix this misapprehension, aided by things like his split with the potentially-competent-Machiavellians in his administration like Steve Bannon or Peter Thiel, and the constant churn of corrupt and ineffective appointees.I think the second biggest mistake I made was to expect the Republican Party to eventually see through him and stop liking/respecting him. Trump's approval rating the month after he took office was 40%. Last month it was 39%. The guy wasn't exactly popular, but he held onto the popularity he had for dear life, and that 40% of people never abandoned him. Normally I wouldn't be sure it was worth continuing to talk about politics if I was barely adding anything to the average pundit. But given that I got one or two things right that everyone else got wrong, maybe having an extra person giving additional perspectives is worth it on wisdom-of-crowds and marketplace-of-ideas type grounds. On the other hand, couldn't I make the same argument even if I'd done much worse than the average pundit, as long as I got at least one thing right? I'm not sure. It seems like we're located somewhere between an ideal marketplace of ideas (where perfect Bayesians update the exact right amount on each new idea they hear, so each idea adds something) vs. a flock of sheep (who just update to whatever the last thing they heard was, so if you're worse than average you're bringing things down) I currently intend to blog about current-events-style politics less than before but still a non-zero amount, as an average of those considerations. You might have already noticed this. I will still be recording predictions about the Biden administration, and depending on how I do, I might increase or decrease the current-events-blogging for the next administration.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Mantic Monday: Grading My Trump Predictions - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/mantic-monday-grading-my-trump-predictions"}

He also ran for Mayor of New York city in 1886,  beating out some rando Republican named \"Theodore Roosevelt,\" but  ultimately losing to the favored candidate of Tammany Hall, who saw  George's radical economic ideas as a threat to their well-oiled  political machine (Andrew Yang take note). He ran again in 1897 but died  just 4 days before the election, prompting a national outpouring of  mourning. According to Ralph Gabriel's Course of American Democratic Thought, in New York alone 200,000  people came to see his body lying in repose, half of which had to be  turned away. For context, that one crowd was roughly the size of 10% of the entire population of New York at the time.I'm writing this book review for three reasons:George's  arguments about land, labor, and capital present a fresh alternative to  conventional ideas about \"Capitalism\" and \"Socialism\" (and whatever we  mean by those on any given day)The book has timeless advice for navigating modern crises such as ever-rising rents, homelessness, and the NIMBY vs. YIMBY wars.This is a golden opportunity to shamelessly over-use the catchy phrase \"By George!\"If I had to summarize the book in a single sentence I would put it this way:Poverty  and wealth disparity appear to be perversely linked with progress, The  Rent is Too Damn High, and it's all because of land.Progress and Poverty  is quite readable compared to other 19th-century economic tomes, but  has a tendency to repeat itself. This isn't without purpose xe2x80x93 George  goes to great pains not to be misunderstood; rather than expecting his  readers to tease out the meaning of dense prose and spending the next  century arguing with each other about what he \"really meant\", he goes on  for pages and pages beating a single concept to absolute death, just to  be sure.As a 19th century treatise of Political Economy, the book doesn't match what a modern reader might expect from a book on Economics because  it's not packed to the gills with charts,  graphs, tables, and  statistics (though it does provide a good number of citations and  figures). Nevertheless his argument was compelling enough to spawn an  entire economic school of thought known variously as Georgism or Geoism that persists to this day.Nowadays Georgism gets slapped with the \"heterodox\" label, but it's still relevant enough to get the likes of Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman to grudgingly agree to key points, and Friedrich Hayek is alleged to have been inspired by it to pursue economics in the first place. Marx, on the other hand, wasn't a fan,  seeing it as a last-ditch attempt \"to save capitalist domination and  indeed to establish it afresh on an even wider basis than its present  one... [George] also has the repulsive presumption and arrogance which  is displayed by all panacea-mongers without exception.\" I guess you  can't please everyone.George spends the first few books of Volume  I establishing terms and methodically tearing apart the prevailing  economic theories of his day before presenting his own alternative  theories about how the \"three factors of production\" xe2x80x93 land, labor, and  capital xe2x80x93 relate to each other in the \"laws of distribution.\" He then  explains why the existing system causes poverty to advance alongside  progress, and why we see industrial depressions. Then, he identifies the  root cause of the problem (land ownership and speculative rent) and  presents his solution (the Land Value Tax) in Volume II. He spends the  entire second volume explaining why it is moral and just, how it should  be applied, and why it will solve all of our problems.For the  sake of the reader's attention span, I'll just cover the chapters that  constitute the core of George's philosophy. For sections I gloss over,  I'll include a brief summary of the main point followed by a jump link  to an appendix at the end of the article for those who want more detail.  All block quotes are from Progress & Poverty unless otherwise marked.Special thanks to my friend Adam Perry for helping me edit this piece, as well as to Nate Blair and blogger BlueRepublik  (who have actual degrees in this sort of thing) for fact checking and  answering my technical questions in the vain pursuit of not embarrassing  myself.Alright, let's dive in.George opens by observing an unkept promise made by Industrialists:it was expected, that labor-saving inventions would lighten the toil and improve the condition of the laborer.Industrialization should have freed humankind from drudgery and want. And yet George instead sees:complaints  of industrial depression; of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;  of capital massed and wasting; of pecuniary distress among business men;  of want and suffering and anxiety among the working classIf we finally have the necessary material conditions and technology for utopia, why this suffering, waste, and inefficiency? And  what's the deal with industrial depressions? How can there be periods  where laborers desperately want to work but can't find employment at the  very same time capital sits around in useless piles, begging to be put  to productive use?Contra popular explanations at the time, George  argues it \"can hardly be accounted for by local causes\" such as  military expenditures, tariffs, type of government, dense vs. sparse  populations, or paper money vs. hard currency. This is because he sees  the same basic problem everywhere no matter how different the countries  themselves are. Behind all of these troubles George says there must lie a  common cause.Pulling no punches, the man lays the blame at the feet of progress itself:that  poverty and all its concomitants show themselves in communities just as  they develop into the conditions toward which material progress tends -  proves that the social difficulties existing wherever a certain stage  of progress has been reached, do not arise from local circumstances, but  are, in some way or another, engendered by progress itselfThis  is a pretty bold claim: namely, that the resilience of poverty,  oppression, and inequality in the face of advancing economic development  is not some embarrassing accident we'll eventually get around to  fixing, it's an inescapable consequence of our socioeconomic system.It's  been over 140 years since he wrote the book, so let's hop in my time  machine and see how much of George's complaint is still relevant.Back then, the United States was still in the throes of the Long Depression, which according to the shortest estimate lasted from 1873 to 1879.Below is a graph (source)  of the boom-bust business cycle going back to the 1870's - clearly,  recessions were much more frequent and severe in George's time than they  are today. The late 1800's were wracked with so many panics and crises  in quick succession that some historians count the Long Depression as  lasting for a full 23 years from 1873 to 1896!After  the Great Depression in the 1930's, we see a sharp decrease in the  duration and frequency of recessions. They're still with us now (and the  one we're currently in is the worst since the Great Depression), but  you'd still rather be living in 2021 than 1879.So, have we solved the problem? Is George's complaint obsolete?I mean, this graph of GDP per capita from Stephen Pinker's Enlightenment Now makes it look like in many ways things are getting better:And heck, extreme poverty has been going down everywhere:But this can't be the entire picture, or nobody would be complaining about poverty and inequality.Here - this graph (source),  shows that as consumer goods have gotten cheaper in the United States,  health care, higher education, child care, etc., have skyrocketed in  price, which Scott examined in great detail in Considerations on Cost Disease.And  what about Inequality? In the USA it seems to have reverted to levels  not seen since the Great Depression, and even when it was at its lowest  in 1978, the top 0.1% (not even the top 1%!) still enjoyed a massively  disproportionate share of Wealth (source):And of course, The Rent Is Too Damn High: (source):(source):Although  2021 seems better than 1879 in absolute material terms, George's  complaint still rings true: healthcare and higher education are  increasingly unaffordable, inequality is as bad as it ever was, and The  Rent Is Too Damn High.And even if all of these measures had  improved as well, we still have to contend with a fundamental complaint:  how can human civilization have piled up an amount of wealth best  described as absolutely banana pants insane, and yetstill  have poverty, oppression and cyclical recessions? Yes, greed, evil, and  human nature will always be with us, but isn't it weird that we haven't  eliminated these economic problems the same way we've eliminated  Smallpox, Scurvy, and having to write your scathing polemics about  Thomas Jefferson by candlelight with a goose feather?Giving the mic back to George, he closes the chapter with this haunting quote, first written 142 years ago:If  there is less deep poverty in San Fran Francisco than in New York, is  it not because San Francisco is yet behind new York in all that both  cities are striving for? When San Francisco reaches the point where New  York now is, who can doubt that there will also be ragged and barefooted  children on her streets?I'll just leave this here:Number of Homeless Children in U.S. At All-Time High; California Among Worst States.George  insists sloppy terminology leads to sloppy thinking. Naturally, he  spends an entire chapter beating words to death to correct this.Let's start with Wealth.The common usage, both then and now, is \"anything with an exchange value.\" George doesn't like how this mixes dissimilar things.By George, what is wealth?Wealth is produced when Nature's bounty is touched by human labor resulting in a tangible product that is the object of human desire.Labor  is required, but the amount and type doesn't matter - George offers the  example of simply picking a berry off a bush as an act that transforms  nature's gifts into human wealth. Note particularly that human desire is  an important requirement of wealth; it doesn't matter how much work  someone put into something, if it doesn't gratify human needs or desires  in some way, it's not wealth.Speaking of human desire, let's talk about Value.Where does a thing's value come from? The prevailing theory of the day was the Labor Theory of Value  which originated with Adam Smith and David Ricardo, which says that  Labor is the source of value. The early formulations were a bit  ambiguous, here's Smith in Wealth of Nations for instance:The  value of any commodity ... is equal to the quantity of labor which it  enables him to purchase or command. Labor, therefore, is the real  measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.So...  is a thing's value how much labor it takes to make the thing, or how  much labor someone's willing to exchange for the thing?Nowadays  Labor Theory of Value is most commonly associated with Marx. Marx picks a  lane and says the value of something is tied to the amount of \"socially  necessary labor\" required to produce it. George goes the other way:It  is never the amount of labor that has been exerted in bringing a thing  into being that determines its value, but always the amount of labor  that will be rendered in exchange for it.- Henry George, The Science of Political Economy, p. 253In other words, \"a thing's value is whatever someone is willing to pay for it.\" This is in line with the so-called marginal revolution (the movement, not the blog) and modern theories of value.LaborLabor  is the exertion of human beings. It's possible to labor to no avail  (try punching a concrete wall), but typically humans labor towards an  end, such as gaining wealth. But whether or not we accomplish anything  with our efforts, George calls them labor. Labor isn't just making  things, by the way xe2x80x93 it's also moving or exchanging them.ProductionProduction is labor applied \"to the production of wealth.\" You know, productively.  This is all human exertion that isn't punching a concrete wall and  rewards you for your efforts with something that fits the definition of  wealth. Said wealth is the \"product of labor.\"Wageswhatever is received as the result or reward of exertion is \"wages.\"No  distinction here is made between blue-collar work and white-collar work  xe2x80x93 whether one is called \"hourly pay\" and the other is called \"annual  salary,\" George calls them both \"wages.\" It doesn't matter whether you  receive them from your boss, from customers, or from nature. If you do  work and get something from it, you have received \"wages.\"With those basics under our belt, let's circle back to Wealth:What are some examples of wealth?By  George, Gold is wealth. Teddy bears are wealth. Tesla roadsters and  candy canes and young adult vampire romance novels are wealth. The same  goes for fish you've caught, deer you've hunted, and cool looking rocks  you've picked up on your morning walk. The value of these  things may differ, but as long as they're tangible, originate in nature,  someone ever did a lick of work to make or acquire them, and a human  being somewhere desires them for any reason, they're wealth. It gets a little clearer when we ask what isn't wealth.And by George, Money isn't wealth.Articles  of gold are wealth because they're tangible things that have been dug  up, crafted, and fulfill certain human desires. But paper currency,  digital currencies, and other things that aren't inherently valuable but  merely represent value are not wealth (outside of  putting their physical articles in coin collections or making paper  airplanes, and so forth). Now don't get the man wrong, these things are  certainly valuable. They're just not wealth. They are certificates that represent claims on wealth. For any computer programmers in the audience, money is a pointer to wealth.Likewise Stocks and Bonds and other financial instruments are not wealth. These are also just claims on wealth. A creditor's title to Debt  isn't wealth, either, it's just a claim on the debtor's (typically  future) wealth. And, writing as he was not long after the Civil War,  George points out that Slaves are not wealth either but, represent \"merely the power of one class to appropriate the earnings of another class.\"Wealth,  thus defined, is the terminal \"ground truth\" bits of the economy, and  all the financial layers on top are fancy IOUs that just encode various  claims on it.George offers a thought experiment to test if  something is wealth: if you produce a pile of gold, fish, or Lego  bricks, you've clearly increased the amount of wealth in the world. But  if you produce a giant pile of IOUs that just records who owns what and  who owes what to whom, it doesn't matter how many of them you pile up or  how long the chains of ownership get, you still haven't increased the  amount of real wealth in the world.Again, this isn't saying the  IOUs aren't valuable, they are. But they're only valuable because they  ultimately point to real wealth. If you magically transported everyone  over to a hypothetical Earth 2, carrying over all of Earth 1's money and  financial instruments but none of Earth 1's tangible wealth, the value  of all those IOUs would instantly evaporate.Now what about digital goods? Leaving things like Bitcoin aside for the moment, let's consider the case of a digital image file:By George, this is wealth.Digital  though it may be, it's physically encoded on a storage device  somewhere, and is thus tangible (it's not a pure abstract concept  flitting about in Platonic heaven) and has its origins in nature. Human  exertion built the computer that encodes it, and clicking the button  that saves it to disk or displays it on your screen is labor. Finally,  it directly satisfies human desires (mine, at the very least). It's  value may be negligible, but it's wealth.By contrast, the digital  bit sitting in some database that says I own a particular eBook or mp3  is just a digital IOU xe2x80x93 a claim on the wealth that are the physical bits  on my local storage device or remote server that digitally encodes the  files. The fact that digital files don't seem particularly  physical, and that they can be trivially and endlessly copied, doesn't  mean that Henry George, magically transported to today, wouldn't regard  them as wealth.Okay, so is there anything else that's not wealth?By  George, Bitcoin isn't wealth, in case you were wondering. It's just a  (very fancy) financial instrument, a digital claim on wealth. And that  goes for most crypto assets xe2x80x93 a token on some blockchain that says I own  a painting by Banksy is just another IOU, regardless of the technical  sophistication of its distributed trustless ledger.What about intellectual property? Copyrights, patents, and trademarks are all different forms of Monopoly xe2x80x93  the exclusive, government-granted legal right to do a particular thing  (publish a certain book, manufacture a certain product, use a certain  name in business, etc). The exclusive right to do or produce a thing,  valuable as it may be, is not the thing itself. By George, Monopoly is  not wealth.But there is something big that is wealth xe2x80x93 the C-word.Capital.By  George, Capital is \"wealth devoted to procuring more wealth\", and it's  the next thing he insists everyone is hopelessly confused about.He quotes Adam Smith, agreeing with him thus far:That part of a man's stock which he expects to afford him revenue is called his capital....and also gives us a short etymology lesson on the origin of the term:The  word capital, as philologists trace it, comes down to us from a time  when wealth was estimated in cattle, and a man's income depended upon  the number of head he could keep for their increase.(\"Per capita\" being the Latin for \"by head\")By George, all capital is wealth, but not all wealth is capital. George  notes capital is often described as being \"stored up labor\", and  endorses this view xe2x80x93 but what it really means, is capital is stored up production. It's not literally the labor that's stored up but the wealth generated by it, set aside and then dedicated to the purpose of getting more wealth.George insists that it is the owner's intention that  transforms wealth into capital. If you buy an old factory to throw  parties in for your hipster friends, it's just wealth. But the minute  you decide to put it to work to make something useful (or start charging  your hipster friends a cover charge at the door), it becomes capital.George therefore further insists that a laborer's daily bread and the clothes on their back do not count  as capital, because a person has to eat and wear clothes whether they  work or not. The laborer's tools (and arguably their steel-toed work  boots) can however be counted as capital, because their purpose is to  assist the laborer in getting more wealth by working for wages, and the  laborer wouldn't acquire, use, and maintain those things otherwise.George has more exclusions:We must exclude from the category of capital everything that may be included either as land or labor.Human exertion (labor) by itself can never be capital. The products of human labor become  capital when they are stored up and set to the purpose of getting more  wealth. To muddle this distinction defeats the point of having separate  terms for those things at all, and prevents us from reasoning  meaningfully about how they relate to one another. Labor is not capital,  and neither is labor by itself wealth, it produces wealth xe2x80x93 and if it ain't wealth, it ain't capital.And that brings us to land.Land, land, land.By George, land is not wealth.And it's definitely not capital.The unique specialness of land is George's entire schtick and the very core of his philosophy. The term land embraces, in short, all natural materials, forces, and opportunitiesThat  means that a field or a meadow is \"land\", as is a mountain. But so are  the fish in the sea, the clouds in the sky, veins of gold in the earth's  crust, and the oil deep under ground. These things aren't yet wealth xe2x80x93  not until human beings both a) desire them and b) touch them with labor.So... land is not wealth.But...  how come? I mean, look: land is tangible, it \"comes from nature\",  humans are always productively applying their labor to it, and it  certainly seems capable of gratifying human desires. George sees  this reasoning as understandable, but insists it's the root mistake that  leads other political economists astray xe2x80x93 because for George, land just  is nature itself. Come again?Land is the ultimate source of all wealth, but it's most useful to think of it as a generator, acompletely separate entity from the wealth that human labor and desire draws from it. Players of Magic: the Gathering and Settlers of Catan should already have a solid grasp of this distinction:In  modern times, George would grant electromagnetic spectrum and orbital  real estate for satellites the same status of \"land\" that already  applies to farmland and terrestrial real estate. We don't even need to  speculate about whether he'd attach this status to sunlight because he  straight-up predicted solar power:Even the lack of rain  which makes some parts of the globe useless to man, may, if invention  ever succeeds in directly utilizing the power of the sun's rays, be  found to be especially advantageous for certain parts of production.(That's from Protection or Free Trade, footnote 19)The  important thing to grasp about land is that it comes before everything  humans do or make, and is itself a thing no human can make.Okay, smarty-pants, what about the Netherlands? They've been making land  for centuries! Well, land in the Georgist sense doesn't refer simply to  \"dry land\", but also the sea bed, the oceans, and the skies above. The  \"new land\" in the Netherlands counts as an improvement to land  that already existed. The seabed was always there, but by filling it in  so you can walk around on it, now it's more useful to us (George has a  lot to say about improvements to land, which we'll get to later).Okay, what is land not? nothing that is freely supplied by nature can be properly classed as capitalBy George, land is not wealth.And since it's not wealth, it's not capital.Okay,  we get it. Land is very special to Mr. George and we must never put it  in the same category as wealth, labor, capital, wages, production,  money, or anything else. Why exactly is this so damn important?Well,  by George, if you treat land the same way you would a bar of pig iron,  an hour of work, or a dollar bill, before you know it you'll get poverty  paradoxically advancing alongside progress, inexplicable bouts of  industrial depression, literal genocides and holocausts (he's dead  serious about this), and The Rent Being Too Damn High.With terminology now firmly established, George moves on to the relationship between wages and capital.I'm condensing three chapters here because they all deal with the same basic thing.The question George wants to answer is:Why, in spite of increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living?The  conventional wisdom of George's time is that wages are governed by a  fixed ratio between the number of laborers and the amount of capital  devoted to their employment, because \"the increase in the number of  laborers tends naturally to follow and overtake any increase in  capital.\"So it doesn't matter how much capital you throw at  employing workers, it'll just attract even more workers splitting it up,  so although wages might temporarily wiggle a bit in the long term  they'll always settle back to a \"natural\" minimum. (As we'll see in the  next section, this argument stems from Malthusianism).George  spends some time methodically poking holes in the theory (it's  predictions don't line up with the facts he observes), and then sets out  to prove his replacement theory (emphases mine):wages, instead of being drawn from capital, are in reality drawn from the product of the labor for which they are paid.He pulls a G.K. Chesterton to make his point:During  the time [the laborer] is earning the wages he is advancing capital to  his employer, but at no time, unless wages are paid before work is done,  is the employer advancing capital to him.He starts by identifying the source of confusion:Because  wages are generally paid in money, and in many of the operations of  production are paid before the product is fully completed, or can be  utilized, it is inferred that wages are drawn from pre-existing capitalI  mean, the old theory seems sensible: the employer has capital and uses  it to pay wages. But however you slice it, capital's investment gets  paid back by production when it takes its cut, so does it even make a  difference to talk about where wages are \"drawn\" from? Value goes out,  value comes in, isn't it all a wash?By George, it isn't: in the  old theory, because capital \"must come first\", it follows that \"industry  is limited by capital - that capital must be accumulated before labor  is employed\", which leads to a reductio ad absurdum xe2x80x93 We  are told that capital is stored-up or accumulated labor xe2x80x93 \"that part of  wealth which is saved to assist future production.\" If we substitute  for the word \"capital\" this definition of the word, the proposition  carries its own refutation, for that labor cannot be employed until the  results of labor are saved becomes too absurd for discussion.George  anticipates the following rejoinder xe2x80x93 Well, when we say 'labor is paid  out of capital' we don't mean it as an absolute statement for all stages  of human development (or else we have a chicken-and-the-egg problem and  civilization could never have begun), we just mean it applies to, say,  every civilization that's left the stone age.George will have  none of it and spends three entire chapters relentlessly beating to  death the idea that wages are drawn from capital instead of from  production.He starts with the simple case where wages are paid in  the form of direct, concrete wealth, then moves on to the more complex  case where people are paid in money and other instruments.Laboring for wages:Imagine  a fishing village where nobody cooperates xe2x80x93 each person digs their own  bait and catches their own fish. Then they discover labor specialization  and realize they can catch more fish together if one specializes in  digging and the other in catching. So the digger digs, the catcher  catches, and they share the fish. The digger really contributes as much  to the catch as the one who physically pulls the fish off the hook even  though the digger never directly \"caught\" a fish, and the fish he gets  for his work is directly paid out of his contribution to the total  production. Later, our fisherfolk invent canoes, and one stays home  making and repairing canoes. This increases the haul of the digger and  catcher, and the canoe-er gets paid out of her contribution to the  increased production. And so it goes as society continues to advance.  The work the specialist puts in causes more fish to be caught, and that  person's wages is drawn from the growing pile of fish. As George puts  it: \"Earning is making.\"George gives another example:If  I take a piece of leather and work it up into a pair of shoes, the  shoes are my wages xe2x80x93 the reward of my exertion. Surely they are not  drawn from capital xe2x80x93 either my capital or any one else's capital xe2x80x93 but  are brought into existence by the labor of which they become the wages;  and in obtaining this pair of shoes as the wages of my labor, capital is  not even momentarily lessened one iota... As my labor goes on, value is  steadily added, until, when my labor results in the finished shoes, I  have my capital plus the difference in value between the material and  the shoes. And another:If I hire a man  to gather eggs, to pick berries, or to make shoes, paying him from the  eggs, the berries, or the shoes that his labor secures, there can be no  question that the source of the wages is the labor for which they are  paid.George goes on to say it doesn't matter if you're  paid in money or directly in wealth, because the money is a direct claim  on the underlying wealth. It also doesn't matter if you get paid on  commission. Imagine a whaling ship where each crewman gets paid a share  out of whatever the ship catches. When the ship sails back into port  with a hold full of whale oil and bone, the crew gets paid in money, the  owner simultaneously adds to his capital oil and bone. The crew's money  directly represents their share of the concrete wealth that is the oil  and bone. The owner's capital hasn't decreased, and the workers drew  their wages directly from the production.So let's get to the point, Mr. George xe2x80x93 wages aren't drawn from capital but instead from production. Great, let's grant that xe2x80x93 so what?George  hammers away at this because thinking wages are drawn from capital  leads to a false conclusion, namely that \"labor cannot exert its  productive power unless supplied by capital with maintenance.\"\"Maintenance?\"  Well, workers need food and clothing and they get paid by their  employers, so you could imagine capital as a limiting factor on labor.  But by George, food and clothing isn't capital, it's just wealth, as we  said before.And with regard to wages, the point is that the  employer always gets \"paid\" first, because the second the laborer  produces value, the employer's capital increases:As in  the exchange of labor for wages the employer always gets the capital  created by the labor before he pays out capital in the wages, at what  point is his capital lessened even temporarily?Okay, but  what if I'm just a terrible businessman and I pay somebody $500 an hour  to smash Ming vases, then sell the fragments as aggregate to a  construction crew for a few pennies a pound, all at a tremendous loss?  Surely then the laborer's wages must be drawn from my capital,  because there's not enough productive value generated by the labor to  draw them from!George says okay, sure, but only because I'm an idiot and will soon be out of business:Yet,  unless the new value created by the labor is less than the wages paid,  which can be only an exceptional case, the capital which he had before  in money he now has in goods xe2x80x93 it has been changed in form, but not  lessened.Fair enough, Mr. George, but what if I'm  building some enormously expensive multi-decade project, like a dam or a  nuclear power plant or a cathedral? The kind of thing we call a  \"capital-intensive\" project? What do you have to say to that?George  points out that as laborers labor, they progressively add value to  whatever they're producing. Take the case of a shipwright building ships  for an employer xe2x80x93 even if the boss can't sell a half-finished ship, it  still holds value (for one, it costs less to finish a half-finished ship  then no ship at all). And with every stroke of the laborer's work, the  employer who owns the shipyard gets an incremental increase in his stock  of capital.It is not the last blow, any more than the  first blow, that creates the value of the finished product xe2x80x93 the  creation of value is continuous, it immediately results from the  exertion of labor.A pedant would point out that the  \"last hit\" that finishes the product which makes it ready for market  adds disproportionate value, but George's point is just to establish  that value is continuously created, and doesn't magically come into  being allat once right at the end.George further points out that if you look at things like agriculture you'll see the market directly acknowledging his theory:As  a plowed field will bring more than an unplowed field, or a field that  has been sown more than one merely plowed... It is tangible in the case  of orchards and vineyards which, though not yet in bearing, bring prices  proportionate to their age.George freely admits that capital can be required for certain kinds of work, but he disagrees with what its purpose is. It's not a pool that wages get paid out of.He  goes on for another chapter on \"The Maintenance of Laborers Not Drawn  From Capital\" but I think we can safely skip it and move on. TL:DR xe2x80x93  George hammers to absolute death the idea that Laborers derive their own  maintenance (food/shelter/clothing/etc) from their wages, with George  insisting it is drawn from production and... you guessed it, not from capital.At  least some of George's ideas will not seem so radical to modern readers  (especially those already critical of capitalism or neoclassical  economics), but it's important to understand that at the time almost  everything he was saying was considered deeply radical and shocking.  Capital was the fundamental driving force of the economy and labor was  utterly dependent on it, and the Malthusian theory of overpopulation was  the accepted explanation for why wages were low and workers were  starving. Okay, Mr. George. You've spent three whole chapters beating me over the head with what the functions of capital aren't. So what are the functions of capital?Capital \"increases the power of labor to produce wealth.\"How?By enabling labor to apply itself more effectively (power tools go brrrr)By availing labor of the reproductive forces of nature (cows make baby cows)By making possible the division & specialization of labor (you dig bait, I'll catch fish)Capital is a force multiplier that  supercharges the productive power of labor. It doesn't supply labor  with raw materials (nature does), nor does it provide for the  maintenance of workers (who eat bread by the sweat of their own brow).George says this is why capital isn't a limit on industry....okay, George grants that capital may limit the form of industry. You can't plow without a plow or milk without a cow. George also grants that the lack of specialized tools can greatly limit productivity because you don't get the benefit of the force-multiplying effect of capital.Um...  aren't you contradicting yourself here, Mr. George? You spent all this  time hammering home your doctrine of wages to prove that capital doesn't  limit industry, but you just said its absence can limit both the form and the productivity of labor!Time to unpack what we mean by \"limit\" and be super clear about it from now on:But  to say that capital may limit the form of industry or the  productiveness of industry is a very different thing from saying that  capital limits industry.Okay, what do you mean?For  the dictum of the current political economy that \"capital limits  industry,\" means not that capital limits the form of labor or the  productiveness of labor, but that it limits the exertion of labor.Okay, I think I see what he's saying. The existing school of thought says that because capital provides labor with both materials and maintenance, therefore if  capital dries up, labor productivity must go down because workers will  have nothing to work on, and nothing to eat or wear. Labor is thus  \"limited\" by capital, for without it is literally and metaphorically starved for capital.But  George says no xe2x80x93 the only way capital actually \"limits\" productivity in  real life is in the degrees by which it force-multiplies labor's  productivity and unlocks certain forms of labor in the tech tree. The  kind of \"limit\" George objects to is the idea that you need capital just  to get any work done at all, or that without capital to sustain it,  labor will shrivel up. Instead, capital is rocket fuel that labor  supplies to itself by investing a portion of its wages.And yet,  with all the awesome slots we've unlocked on the tech tree, and barrels  and barrels of rocket fuel to fire up eager laborers, we still find our  economy sinking into mysterious depressions. Something is gumming up the works, but it's not a simple scarcity of capital:the real limitation is not the want of capital, but the want of its proper distributionOr  as G.K. Chesterton said, \"Too much capitalism does not mean too many  capitalists, but too few capitalists.\" This might seem like a pedantic  distinction xe2x80x93 misallocated capital could be said to be \"scarce\" capital xe2x80x93  but they're not the same thing at all. As Francis Bacon said in 1625:Riches  were like [Manure]: When it lay, upon an heape, it gave but a stench,  and ill odour; but when it was spread upon the ground, then it was cause  of much fruit.Because the prevailing theories of  George's time are based on incorrect ideas about the relation between  wages and capital, \"all remedies, whether proposed by professors of  political economy or workingmen, which look to the alleviation of  poverty either by the increase of capital or the restriction of the  number of laborers or the efficiency of their work, must be condemned.\"In  short, more investment, more protectionism, and more efficiency  programs can't, won't, and haven't fixed poverty and industrial  depressions because they all proceed from false premises.Having  finally beaten the nexus of wages, capital, and labor into a bloody  pulp, George turns his eyes towards another leading theory for why  everything is terrible: the specter of overpopulation.The entire second book might as well be titled \"Why Malthus is Dumb and Wrong and Bad.\" It's dedicated to dunking on Malthusianism,  a philosophy that ascribes economic crises to the exponential growth of  the human population, which must necessarily end in catastrophe.according to Malthusian theory, poverty appears as increase in population necessitates the more minute division of subsistence.George  attacks Malthusian ideas not just because they're wrong, but because  they make it easier to accept the prevailing theory of wages (as more capital is allocated, laborers will keep popping up like weeds to gobble  it up, so wages must eternally stagnate). George draws a straight line  between these faulty ideas and holocausts and genocides xe2x80x93 specifically  citing how colonial oppression in China, India, and Ireland were  explicitly justified on Malthusian grounds. One million people died in the English-engineered Irish potato famine alone, and when you add in those who fled the entire population declined by 25% percent.  And this isn't a tenuous link either xe2x80x93 George directly connects the  completely avoidable famine to his favorite bugbear, private landownership and extortionate rent.Given that Malthusianism is  now widely discredited I'm just going to skip this chapter, but if you  want to hear George in all his righteous fury, check out Appendix A  (there's a link that returns here at the end):Appendix A: George Dunks on MalthusianismWhen society produces wealth, who gets different shares of it, and why? Let's start by beating some words to death.By George, we're told that there are three factors in production: Land, Labor, and Capital.  For each of these terms there must be a \"law of distribution\" that  explains how each gets compensated for its part in production.The reward you get from production by owning Land is called Rent.The reward you get from production by supplying Labor is called Wages.The reward you get from production by supplying Capital is called ... um, what?We're looking for a term that clearly expresses the return to capital alone and nothing else.The closest thing we have is Interest, and that's probably good enough.George  gives the common definition of interest as \"the return for the use of  capital, exclusive of any labor in its use or management, and exclusive  of any risk, except such as may be involved in the security.\" This is  pretty close to what we want xe2x80x93 something that expresses the sole return to capital without mixing in anything else.But ... what about Profits? Profits is \"almost synonymous\" with revenue, assuming  you have some left after you deduct expenses. It means a gain in money  or wealth, but the trouble is this gain is a mix of rent, wages,  and \"compensations for the risk peculiar to the various uses of  capital.\" What we want is a term that means the return to capital alone, totally separate from the return to laborers and landowners.To  talk about the distribution of wealth into rent, wages, and profits is  like talking of the division of mankind into men, women, and human  beings.George spends a few pages talking about how  everyone from Adam Smith on down got confused about this (spoiler: it's  tied up with thinking wages are drawn from capital), before presenting  his model for how it all works. If you want to see him knock that stuff  down, see Appendix B (there's a link that returns here at the end):Appendix B: George dunks on the Conventional Laws of DistributionHere's George's model for how it all works:Land is\"all natural opportunities or forces\" and its return is rentLabor is \"all human exertion\" and its return is wagesCapital is\"all wealth used to produce more wealth\" and its return is interestGeorge  says the false assumption at the root of the old theories is in  thinking of \"capital as the prime factor in production, land as its  instrument, and labor as its agent or tool.\"George makes the following assertions:\"Labor can be exerted only upon land\"\"It is from land that the matter which it transmutes into wealth must be drawn\"\"Capital is not a necessary factor in production\"Therefore, we should always put land first in all our inquiries rather than capital, which ought to come last.George then sets out his three laws of distribution.Let's  be careful about the word \"Rent.\" In modern usage, there is the concept  of \"Economic Rent\" as well as \"Rent\" in the everyday sense of regular  payments you make in exchange for the use of something that you are  \"renting.\" The modern definition of \"Economic Rent\", per Wikipedia is:economic  rent is any payment ... to an owner or factor of production in excess  of the costs needed to bring that factor into productionTo be clear, Economic Rent is a bad thing xe2x80x93 all taking, no giving.When George uses the word \"Rent\", he specifically means the return to land, and this is what he says it is: Rent,  in short, is the share in the wealth produced which the exclusive right  to the use of natural capabilities gives to the owner.Land  has zero cost of production because it's already there and you can't  make it. This means that any payment or benefit you can realize by  excluding others from using land (or its fruits) is necessarily \"in  excess of the costs needed to bring that factor into production.\"By George, all land rent is Economic Rent.Furthermore, any piece of land has only one seller, and no producers. This further meets the definition of Monopolyxe2x80x93 Greek for \"one seller.\" This is why you hear Georgists talking about \"Land Monopoly.\"Land has value because people are willing to pay you for the privilege of using it.The price of rent derives from the most marginal land available.I'll  explain with an example. Let's grade some imaginary lots according to  their productivity by using abstract utility points, or \"utils\".Lot A is good fertile land worth 100 utils.Lot B is just as good, also worth 100 utils.Lot C is crappy land worth 10 utils.Let's  say I own Lot A. I won't be able to charge you any rent to work on Lot  A, if Lot B is freely available for anyone to use. Why would you pay  even 1 util worth of rent if you could just work on Lot B, earn 100  utils, and keep it all?But  once I buy Lot B, now if you want access to 100-util Land you have to  pay me. How much can I charge? Well, you could always work on Lot C for  free, and it'll yield 10 utils. So the most I can charge is 90 utils  (100 - 90 = 10).So here's the Law of Rent xe2x80x93 rent is determined by the \"margin of production\"  (AKA the \"margin of cultivation\") xe2x80x93  the difference between how much  you can produce from a particular piece of land (Lot A or B) compared to  the least productive alternative (Lot C).Notice that I as the  landlord am not really doing anything here other than owning the land,  and yet I can extract a huge amount of value, because unlike capital,  land is a hard limit on labor xe2x80x93 you can't work without a place to work  or without material that comes from nature. And so I take my share first  without really contributing anything to production other than  gatekeeping access to land.Rent, in short, is the price  of monopoly, arising from the reduction to individual ownership of  natural elements which human exertion can neither produce nor increase.C'mon, is land really such a big deal?In  the popular imagination we pit \"capitalists\" against \"laborers\" but a  lot of those \"capitalists\" are landowners in disguise, because in  non-Georgist frameworks land is typically considered a kind of capital.  George says landowners oppress both labor and capital, cheating both hard work and investment out of their fair share.Okay,  but is this still relevant in the modern age, with the internet and  work-from-home? Obsessing about land just feels so 19th century. Well,  in Silicon Valley rents are famously off the charts, and those and all  other rents seep into the economy at every level. Workers priced out of  living close by have to spend more time and money commuting longer  distances to work, and businesses must devote an increasingly larger  share of their production to landowners who aren't actively contributing  anything to productivity. What else could explain how a family of four  making $100,000 in San Francisco is considered to be living below the poverty line?Here, take a look at this chart (source):I found this in a tweet by Thomas Piketty,  and it shows the breakdown of personal assets in Spain over the last  100+ years. The bulk of the value of personal assets is from  landownership. This is still the case even though the chart includes  \"financial assets\" xe2x80x93 which are just IOUs that ultimately have something  real (e.g. land or wealth) underpinning their value. If we exclude  those, the true portion of overall value represented by land is even  higher than this graph first implies.And this isn't just Spain.  Here's a graph Nate Blair made for the UK, excluding all financial  instruments and only looking at real assets:No matter how  hard you try, \"there is no occupation in which labor and capital can  engage which does not require the use of land.\" Whenever anyone does  labor, the owner of some piece of land xe2x80x93 whether it's the farm in the  middle of Kansas that grows your food, the lot upon which the server  farm sending you these bytes sits, or the ground that right now sits  beneath your feet xe2x80x93 is sticking their finger in the pie.George reminds us that labor and capital will have to share whatever landowners take off the top of production in rent:As Produce = Rent + Wages + Interest,Therefore, Produce - Rent = Wages + InterestSo... what happens when the productivity of land goes up? Let's  go back to Lot A and Lot B, both 100-util fields. Let's say they belong  to different landlords, and I'm a tenant on Lot B. I improve the soil  of the field I'm working on so now it's worth 110 utils. What happens?My landlord raises the rent, of course!The  only way wages (the return to labor) and interest (the return to  capital) can go up as productivity increases, is if land values fail to  rise at the same rate.George wants to find the fundamental reason capital is able to produce wealth and justly claim a fair share of production.Remember  that capital is wealth devoted to getting more wealth. So if capital is  wealth that begets wealth, it makes sense that if I lend it out to you,  I miss out on the potential for it to grow while it's out of my hands.  George says I am justly entitled to ask for more back than I originally  gave you.Let's say I loan you some corn seeds for a season. Had I not leant them to you, in a season's time I could have grown my own  crop of corn and been left with more seed than I started with. So in a  perfectly square deal, you need to give me back what I started with and what I could have expected to gain from natural increase (less the value of the labor required to get things started).Likewise  with any other article of capital xe2x80x93 say bricks or lumber. In the time  I've spent without it while it was in your possession, I could have  found someone else who had a better use for it than I did and exchanged  it for something of theirs that I had a better use for, leaving me with  capital of greater value. George says the act of progressively  exchanging things in a way that increases subjective value for all  involved is analogous to the natural forces of nature that make living  capital (like corn and cows) grow over time. Remember, \"subjective value\" is real value. In a game of Settlers of Catan,  if I have two bricks and you have two lumber, neither of us can build  anything. The simple act of trading one brick for one lumber means both  of us are better off because each of us can now build a road. The  amount of bricks and lumber in the world didn't increase, but the amount  of roads (or potential roads) did, and that represents a real increase in wealth.Interest  thus springs from the \"reproductive\" powers of capital, whether that's  biological reproduction, or the more abstract reproductive force of  exchanging things so that you have a more valuable distribution of  capital than you started with.As for how it relates to the other  two returns to production xe2x80x93 the more powerful the \"power of increase\"  the capital has, the greater return interest can claim compared to  wages. If you're ploughing a field and I lend you a tractor which makes  you ten times as productive, I can justly claim more compensation for  that than if I lend you a mule that only makes you twice as productive.  However, rent still holds the whip hand, so the margin of cultivation  determines how much return is left over to divvy up between interest and  wages.This is because the net \"reproductive\" value of capital  goes down given rent is a general tax on overall productivity. The  amount I would have gained by using the thing productively over the  period of time it was out on loan (the amount I can justly charge in  interest) is reduced by how much I have to pay in rent.Wages,  like interest, are limited by the margin of production. Within that  limit there's not much to understand about how wages work except that  people seek to satisfy their desires \"with the least exertion,\" which is  a fancy way of saying people don't like to get ripped off. If two  bosses offer the same exact job, but one offers higher pay, I'm taking  that gig. If two bosses pay the same, but one is asking for twice as  much work, I'll tell that boss where he can stick it.Wages  depend upon the margin of production, or upon the produce which labor  can obtain at the highest point of natural productiveness open to it  without the payment of rent.So with all three laws established George sums it up like so:Where land is free and labor is unassisted by capital, the whole produce will go to labor as wages.Where  land is free and labor is assisted by capital, wages will consist of  the whole produce, less that part necessary to induce the storing up of  labor as capital.Where land is subject to ownership and rent  arises, wages will be fixed by what labor could secure from the highest  natural opportunities open to it without the payment of rent.Where  natural opportunities are all monopolized, wages may be forced by the  competition among laborers to the minimum at which laborers will consent  to reproduce.This is the reason George says that wages  are so high in \"new countries\" where there's more land available than in  countries where it's been locked up for centuries.Here's how it all fits together:Though  neither wages nor interest anywhere increase as material progress goes  on, yet the invariable accompaniment and mark of material progress is  the increase of rent xe2x80x93 the rise of land values.And:where the value of land is highest, civilization exhibits the greatest luxury side by side with the most piteous destitutionAs a society undergoes material progress, the rent goes up. Why?Let's break it down. Three things contribute to material progress: Increasing populationTechnological advanceImprovements in the social fabric\"Social  fabric\" is my term, George calls it \"greater knowledge, education,  government, police, manners, and morals, so far as they increase the  power of producing wealth.\"How does Populationgrowth affect the distribution of wealth?Generally speaking, as you get more people your productivity grows exponentially rather than linearly:The labor of 100 men ... will produce much more than one hundred times as much as the labor of one manThat's  thanks to specialization and division of labor. This happens without  needing any technological advance. And as labor's productivity goes up,  it makes it worth developing on more marginal (ie, less productive)  lands, pushing the margin of production down (and outward  geographically), which gives landlords more room to jack up rents.A  bustling town is a more valuable and productive place to live than a  tiny hut in the middle of a remote forest. In the town there's a  butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, and others to supply you with  whatever your heart desires. In the middle of the forest you have to do  everything yourself, regardless of how abundant the natural resources  might be. Every neighbor that moves in to town makes you \"richer\" in  this sense because they contribute to the total productive potential of  your community. Population increase also drives productivity by  making things valuable that were useless before. Let's say there's some  resource on some land, say iron ore. Even if you have all the technology  to mine and smelt it, you probably aren't capable of doing this whole  operation yourself, and if nobody else lives there you don't have  anybody to sell the iron to. It's the presence of a civilization that  will give that ore its value, and for that you need to increase the  population. Until population shows up to give it value, the ore is  \"latent potential\" in the land.By George, increasing population increases the share of rent (and decreases the share of interest and wages) in two ways: It lowers the margin of productionIt brings out the latent potential of landHow does Technological advance affect the distribution of wealth?Tech  saves labor. It lets you accomplish the same thing with less work, or  more things with the same amount of work. This leads to more wealth  being produced. Now, what do you need to produce more things? Capital is nice to have, but the two things you must  have are labor, and land. So wanting to make more things means more  demand for land, because you can't labor without it. And when you reach  the productive limit of the land available to you, you seek out more  marginal lands, extending the margin of production. Demand for land goes  up, land values go up, and soon enough The Rent Is Too Damn High.This  means that as you introduce advanced machinery, the extra productivity  they bring gets soaked up in rising land values, which gets extorted as  rent.every labor-saving invention, whether it be a steam  plow, a telegraph, an improved process of smelting ores, a perfecting  printing press, or a sewing machine, has a tendency to increase rent.As a historical aside, I'll point out an extreme example of this: the cotton gin. This device massively decreased the amount of labor required to process cotton, which ironically increased the  spread of slavery (slaves being laborers compelled to pay all their  wages in rent). As the amount of slave labor required to process a unit  of cotton went down, the margin of production was extended to more  marginal lands. This caused the rents on the best lands to go up,  further enriching slave-owning plantation landowners and increasing  their influence. With the margin extended, demand shot up for land  previously deemed unsuitable for cotton production, increasing the  pressure to admit new states to the union as slave states.The  gin's effect on entrenching slavery was so profound that it's commonly  blamed for prolonging the institution and laying the foundations for the  Civil War.How does improved \"social fabric\" affect the distribution of wealth?Improvements  to the social fabric that just make society generically better do the  same thing. If the people in a neighborhood are nicer and more helpful,  provide a robust network of mutual aid, start a bowling league and book  club, etc, land values rise. That's because it's more desirable and  productive to live in a place where you can e.g. trust your neighbor to  watch your kid for an hour while also teaching them to whittle. Land  value goes up, and so does the rent.Now, let's talk about the expectations raised by material progress.What happens when people know something will increase in value?That's  right, they buy it up in a speculative frenzy and hold on to it  forever, further driving the price up. With conventional speculative  instruments like beanie babies or tulips,  the bubble eventually pops. But Land has unique properties that allow  this vicious cycle to continue more or less indefinitely.What  happens when a city is growing, technology is advancing, improvements  are being made to land, and so forth? Land values go up. Sure,  speculators can still lose their shirts if a city falls into decline,  but this isn't nearly as hard to predict as volatility in penny stocks  or what next year's hot Christmas toy will be.So  as soon as there's a whiff of progress in a given area everyone starts  HODLing land, but not to use it themselves. In fact speculators often  keep it out of use, because this forces people to use less valuable land instead, pushing the margin of production down even further, forcing land values up, and now The Rent Is Too Damn High.Georgist pundit geoliberal explains the mindset of a speculator:The  only thing investors actually maximize is risk adjusted rate of return.  When you know rents will increase, your best return comes from buying  extra land, not improving the land you haveThis  is how it's possible to have urban blight and slums in areas with  extremely high land values. Even if there's a temporary dip in prices,  speculators know that if they just keep HODLing the general trend xe2x80x93  absent a local collapse xe2x80x93  is that land value always goes up.Here's George:Take  now... some hard-headed business man, who has no theories, but knows  how to make money. Say to him: \"Here is a little village; in ten years  it will be a great cityxe2x80x94in ten years the railroad will have taken the  place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle; it will  abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously  multiply the effective power of labor. Will in ten years, interest be  any higher?\" He will tell you, \"No!\" \"Will the wages of the common labor  be any higher...?\" He will tell you, \"No the wages of common labor will  not be any higher...\" \"What, then, will be higher?\" \"Rent, the value of  land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession.\" ...without  doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota of wealth to the  community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you may have a  luxurious mansion, but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.I  don't think it's a coincidence that real estate is one of the oldest  investments on Earth and the principal concern of basically every war  ever.We  had two questions at the beginning of this book: why are there  industrial depressions, and why poverty seems to advance alongside  progress.You guess it, it's all because of land and rent.By George, industrial depressions are caused by land speculationSpeculation  has a tendency to press the margin of production down until it's just  past its limit, forcing labor and capital to accept returns so small  that it actually hinders production or ceases altogether.The  saving grace is that as long as the population is growing and/or  technology is improving, productivity will go up, and production will  start again. But soon enough the land values go up. This drives  speculators bidding up the price of land, anticipating future even  higher land values, which stresses the productive margin again. So  you get a cycle xe2x80x93 productivity rises, economy booms, land values rise,  production stagnates or stops. No matter how complicated or  sophisticated the economy gets with layer upon layer of financialization  and abstraction, when you unravel it all George says this is the  ultimate cause.Periods of industrial activity always  culminate in a speculative advance of land values, followed by symptoms  of checked productionThis is how you get the baffling  situation where able hands are eager and willing to work, capital is  ready to employ them, natural materials are abundant, and yet the  laborers are idle and the factories stand empty.So that's it for industrial depressions. What about the other paradox of poverty advancing alongside progress?By George, poverty advances alongside progress because of rentThe  reason why, in spite of increase of productive power, wages constantly  tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is that, with  increase in productive power, rent tends to even greater increase, thus  producing a constant tendency to the forcing down of wages.George  backs this up with several pages of specific regional figures  demonstrating how land values have continued to explode all over the  world.By George, on average and in the long run, no amount of  hard work from labor, no force multiplication from capital, no increased  gain from co-operation and specialization, no labor-saving invention or  increase in personal efficiency, work ethic, or morals, can escape the  long reach of rent.In short, increased power of production has everywhere added to the value of land; nowhere has it added to the value of labor;George  notes that the mass die-off of the Black Death in England in the 1300's  significantly reduced the productivity of the individual laborer, and  yet wages went up. That's because the decreased population also  caused a massive drop in competition for land, in turn causing rents to  plummet. (For more detail on this read about the Peasants' revolt, also known as Wat Tyler's rebellion).George  says the opposite happened during the reign of Henry VIII, who seized  the lands of the church and those held in common by the peasants, and  handed them out to newly minted aristocrats, which was followed by  suppressed wages.In the reign of Henry VII., half a  bushel of wheat would purchase but little more than a day's common  labor, but in the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth, half a bushel  of wheat would purchase three day's common labor.He sums it all up like this:Material  progress cannot rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to  the power of producing wealth from land; and hence, when land is  monopolized, it might go on to infinity without increasing wages or  improving the conditions of those who have but their labor.So  there's our answer: the monkey wrench that causes the boom-bust cycle  of industrial depressions is rent, and even though we have more than  enough material wealth to provide for everybody's needs, rent prevents  us from distributing it fairly and equitably.Okay, The Rent Is Too Damn High, and now we finally know why. What are we going to do about it?George  goes down the list of everything we've already tried and why it hasn't  worked (or has worked, but less well than we hoped), which you can read  about in Appendix C (there's a link that returns here at the end):Appendix C: The Insufficiency of Remedies Currently AdvocatedGeorge says the solution is to make land common property.He  doesn't want to confiscate land, or force everyone to live on some  giant hippie commune. He proposes instead to let everyone continue to  \"own\" land exactly as they do now, but we should impose a special tax to  neutralize the perverse incentives of land rent. He anticipates a lot of pushback on this, and promises that his remedy:Is justCan actually be practically appliedWill solve all our problems once and for allGeorge asks, \"what constitutes the rightful basis of property?\" What gives you the right to say \"this is mine?\" George  asserts as self-evident the principle that a person is entitled to the  fruits of their labor. What you make on your own time with your own  resources, is yours to do with as you please xe2x80x93 use it, give it away,  trade it, destroy it. You don't harm anyone else doing so.It follows that neither I nor anyone else am entitled to the product of your  labor. If we're both independent hunter-gatherers, and you pick some  berries from a bush, I don't have any fundamental right to demand them  from you.If you improve land in some way, you're entitled to own  and use that, of course. That's the product of your labor. But to claim  exclusive and permanent ownership of the land itself xe2x80x93 from which all  wealth springs and without which labor is impossible xe2x80x93 is to demand the  product of other's labor. So to invoke the sanctity of private property  to defend private land ownership is self-refuting.But what about  the right of \"I was here first?\" Well, George points out that in most  cases someone was there before you were, too (and often they were  removed by force). Just because you arrived one second, one minute, one  year, or one decade before someone else doesn't give you some  fundamental right to exclude others from access to nature's free gifts.  (Note: this doesn't give people the right to just come in your house and  rifle through your underwear drawer at any time of day, we'll get to  that).And what about native populations? Isn't this just an  excuse for colonialists to come in and steal their land by denying their  claim of being on the land first? By George, no xe2x80x93 this is a good time  to point out that many Native Americans already had a roughly Georgist  understanding of land xe2x80x93 treating it as common property,  and it was precisely the colonialists' conception of land as private  property that was the mechanism by which the indigenous population was  expelled and their lands seized.The English first practiced this  on their own people xe2x80x93 once upon a time wide swaths of land in England  were held in common until the government privatized those lands and gave  them out to well-connected gentry in a process called Enclosure. If you've ever heard of the Luddites,  you should know they weren't merely rebelling against the march of  technology, they were also fighting against the forcible seizure of  their lands by industrialists, who far from being salt-of-the-earth  free-enterprise entrepreneurs, were in actual fact crony capitalists  stealing the people's land with the aid of anti-free-market subsidies  and armed thugs, all supported by Big Governmentxe2x84xa2.As a practical  matter though, if you want to impose a Georgist policy, that only  applies to territory your state has authority over. Indian reservations  in the United States are supposed to be sovereign enclaves with their  own jurisdiction. Native Americans should decide for themselves whether  they want to adopt any particular policy.The other reason the remedy is just, is that private ownership of land leads to serfdom.The  essence of slavery is that it takes from the laborer all he produces  save enough to support an animal existence, and to this minimum the  wages of free labor, under existing conditions, unmistakably tend.George  points out that even though Slavery was abolished, the Southern  landowners just changed the brand name to \"sharecropping\" and were able  to continue to extract tremendous wealth from \"free\" Black Americans in  the form of rent.Okay, but excluding evil Southern plantation  owners, don't landlords deserve compensation for their work? What about  Ms. Nguyen, the nice lady who manages your apartment block and went the  extra mile for you when your A/C went out last summer?I like Ms.  Nguyen too, but let's contrast her with Mr. Slumlord, who owns the  apartment block next door that's superficially identical, but who won't help you when your A/C goes out in the middle of summer.  Ms. Nguyen charges higher \"rent\" for her much better maintained units  because part of that \"rent\" is actually her justly compensated wages for her labor in managing them, as well as interest from returns on the capital she's  invested in their ongoing improvement and maintenance. She also  collects a good bit of true Georgian rent because she is, after all, a  landlord.Mr. Slumlord puts in as little work as he can get away  with and invests as little capital into maintenance as will keep the  state off his back. His return is almost entirely rent. And the only reason he can charge rent in the first place is because of the valuable location xe2x80x93 value the community produced, not him.And that's the real injustice of land rent xe2x80x93 the community produces the value, but the landlord charges rent to access it.Okay, land as common property, rent must die, I'm sold. How do we actually do it?George proposes a land value tax, or LVT. Note I didn't say property tax. Property tax is a tax on the value of a piece of land and it's improvements. So if you're a homeowner, when you pay property tax, you pay tax for both the value of your house and the lot it's sitting on. With land value tax you only pay tax on the \"ground rent\", which is the value of your land, but not the improvements.What's an improvement?By  George, a little green house is an improvement. A fancy red hotel is an  improvement. A garage, a sidewalk, a public park, a Starbucks, a hotdog  stand, are all improvements. Installing a bunch of dikes in the  Netherlands and dumping landfill into the seabed to turn wet land into  dry is an improvement. All improvements come from labor, and optionally  capital, and so its fair for those factors to take their return. If I  \"rent\" you my hotdog stand (but not the lot it sits on) my  return would be classified as interest in George's framework because the  hotdog stand isn't land, it's capital xe2x80x93 the stored-up fruits of my  labor that I'm using to get more wealth.The  problem with our current system is that when anyone in the community  builds improvements, it makes adjoining land more valuable, and then  those adjoining landlords jack up the rent. This makes things worse for  everybody but the landlords. George's insight is that extra value from  my improvement \"spills over\" from my land and is soaked up by the ground  rent of your land.So under a land value tax, we can correct for  the perverse economic incentives, distortions, and oppressions that come  from land rent, without having to actually take your land from you.We may safely leave them the shell, if we take the kernel. It is not necessary to confiscate land xe2x80x94 only to confiscate rent.You also are 100% the owner of the improvements on your land, which won't  be taxed. This is why Georgism doesn't mean people have the right to  barge into your house in the middle of the night even though land is  \"held in common.\" Your house is still private property, but the value of the land it sits on is common property.What  if I plant some nice trees, and invest in some landscaping to stop  erosion? Where's the line between \"improvements\" and \"ground rent?\" In  most cases it's pretty straightforward to separately assess the value of  a plot from the value of what sits on it (modern property tax assessors do this already),  but George grants that in some edge cases with the passage of time at  least some improvements will be subsumed into the land value and that's  okay:But it will be said: There are improvements which  in time become indistinguishable from the land itself! Very well; then  the title to the improvements become blended with the title to the land;  the individual right is lost in the common right. It is the greater  that swallows up the less, not the less that swallows up the greater.Okay, ground rent bad. How much should we tax it?By George, One Hundred Percent.Take  the rent the tenant has to pay each month, calculate the portion  attributable to the value of the unimproved land itself, and send it to  the taxing agency.Wow!  100% tax rate on ground rent! Can we really do that? In practice  Georgists often talk about rates closer to 85+% given real-world  limitations in assessment, but the point is to hit it as hard as you  possibly can. Get close enough and you still have good effects.Won't  land taxes jack up land prices? No, actually - in fact it will do the  opposite, because such a tax is laser-calibrated to eliminate  speculation, which makes up the bulk of inflated land values, and thus rent. Tax land for the full ground rent and you make real estate more affordable, not less.Won't it enable an all-powerful centralized nanny state? Quite the opposite xe2x80x93  land value assessment is a fundamentally bottom-up, localized task, so  it naturally empowers local municipalities at the expense of distant central authorities. Also, income taxes, wealth taxes, investment taxes,  etc, require an ever-vigilant centralized bureaucracy peeking into  every aspect of an individual's life to catch tax evaders, who have  every incentive to hide their assets or even just flee. Perversely, the IRS currently audits the poor at the same rate as the top 1%, even though higher earners are responsible for withholding the vast majority of tax money in fraud.Land can't move or hide, and nowadays we have tools like GIS  to make it even easier to assess. Under land value tax, nobody needs to  pry into your personal life or impose burdensome accounting rules on  your small business that actually entrench the power of giant  corporations (who have entire departments devoted to serving up the Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich). Today land value tax is widely considered to be the only tax that doesn't suffer from Deadweight Loss.Deadweight  Loss is the lost economic activity or value caused by some policy. It's  often summarized by the phrase \"If you want less of something, tax it.\"Look at this chart, for example:The  place where the demand curve (red) and supply curve (blue) meet is the  equilibrium point that the market naturally tends towards. But if we  impose a price control lower than what the market will bear, the yellow  area of the curve shows economic activity that can't happen. If you put  price controls on gasoline, for instance, you'll get shortages because  there's more demand than supply, and supply can't profitably rise to  meet the extra bit of demand that's willing to pay a little more.But here's how things look with a land value tax, notice that the supply curve is vertical xe2x80x93 that's weird, what does that mean?A  vertical supply curve means no matter what the price of land is, the  same amount will always be supplied. This is because you can't make land  xe2x80x93 the supply is effectively fixed. Remember, the Netherlands doesn't  count because the sea bed is land, and filling it in is just an  improvement to land that already existed. And even if we granted \"The  Netherlands occasionally makes land\" for the sake of argument, the  amount of land \"created\" in this way is pretty darn negligible in the  grand scheme of the economy, and almost exclusively the domain of  governments or state-owned actors.The supply of land being fixed  has some really interesting properties. By contrast, consider oil, the  supply of which is not fixed. If we tax oil, some of the more marginal  wells will be too expensive to operate and make a profit, so producers  shut those down and the supply of oil decreases. Deadweight loss comes  from a producer's ability to change the amount of product they supply in  response to price signals. You'll notice the above graph of land tax  has no deadweight loss at all!Since nobody produces land, it's  the one thing you can tax without getting less of it. This drives out  speculators entirely. Speculators can no longer distort rents by bidding  up the price of land and holding it out of use, and can no longer  compete with those who actually intend to use the land. This restores the proper balance of land, labor, and capital. Now  if you work harder, or invest more capital, you can actually expect to  see an increasing return without it all being gobbled up by  ever-increasing rent.If you think about it this way, land value tax has negative deadweight loss, because it eliminates the speculative distortion that is the unearned privilege of landownership.Okay, but won't the landlords just pass the land tax on to their tenants?By  George, no. Rent is a price, and price is governed by supply and  demand. Supply of land is fixed, so land value tax has no effect on  supply. What about demand? Except in cases where it causes the economy to boom (a good thing), land value tax won't increase land value xe2x80x93 what  it always does, however, is reduce the demand for land by  speculators. If it costs nothing to hold on to land, of course I'm going  to want to grab some and HODL. If the rent I could hope to gain is taxed away, I won't bother.Consider the case of oil again, where a  tax reduces the supply. Reduced supply, given unchanged demand, causes a  rise in price. And you'll find the increase in price tracks very  closely with the amount of tax.Land value tax is just about the only kind of tax that can't be passed off to someone else. For more on deadweight loss and the land value tax, see Welfare Economics of the Land Value Tax by BlueRepublik.So  does this mean there can never be profitable landlords ever again? Of  course not xe2x80x93 they just have to earn their living honestly like everyone  else. Remember, we don't tax the improvements, just the \"ground  rent.\" So Ms. Nguyen still gets paid for all her honest work and  judicious investments, but Mr. Slumlord doesn't make a dime until he  gets off his lazy butt and does something productive.This is really important, because aside from speculation, the principal cause of land value increase is the productivity of your neighbors. An  empty lot in the middle of nowhere is worthless, but an otherwise  identical empty lot in the middle of New York city is priceless. As they  say in real estate - \"location, location, location.\" The reason  location is valuable is because of the activity and contributions of the  community, and yet the landlord claims the right to seize it all as  rent.Modern economists have some interesting things to say about  George's ideas, too. In 1977 Joseph Stiglitz demonstrated that land  rents have a tendency to almost perfectly equal the value of investment in public goods. He called this the Henry George Theorem. Milton Friedman famously called land value tax the \"Least Worst\" tax. But  one of my all-time favorite endorsements will always be that one time  the economist Ramin Shokrizade unwittingly re-derived land value tax  from first principles to (successfully!) fix recessions in EVE Online.Okay,  so we tax all the ground rent. It will remove the speculative component  of the rent (because there will no longer be any incentive to jack the  prices up artificially), but it won't drive the price down to zero.  That's because 100% LVT is only achievable on a frictionless plane  populated by spherical cows; here in the real world you'll be left with a  small sliver of land value. And of course regardless of the LVT rate,  houses and buildings will still have a price. And that's fine.Land in Times Square will still be a lot more valuable than land in Podunk, Saskatchewan, but both will approach the same price as  the LVT rate gets closer to 100%. This encourages people to actually  make use of valuable land rather than holding it out of use, blighting  the urban core and forcing development to sprawl out for miles in every  direction, leading to worse transportation and more pollution. But...  doesn't this mean that if people aren't putting land to productive use,  they'll eventually be pressured to sell it off to someone who will?George sees this as a good thing. Without  land value tax you get situations where somebody can anticipate that an  empty lot will become valuable in the future, buy it, HODL forever,  lobby against future development that would depress their property  values, and now you have the Bay Area's housing crisis.Or buy an  apartment block, do the absolute minimum the tenants will tolerate  without killing you, constantly jack up the rent as the city grows, and  you get slums.As BlueRepublik observes in No, Georgism is Still Sane:If you look at the commercial blight in New York City (http://www.vacantnewyork.com/)  90%+ is from landlords refusing to lease out to small businesses,  waiting for a larger bank or big business to pay a higher rent bill.  This causes property values of nearby businesses to drop, equity value  to drop, and businesses to move out from the city center, increasing  urban sprawl and urban blight. Itxe2x80x99s a massive drain on personal wealth,  and is very highly linked with poverty and higher crime rates. Itxe2x80x99s also  not a great model for having a stable social fabric.In a  fit of performance art, a Georgist by the name of Fay Lewis once  famously bought an empty lot and stuck a big sign on it to demonstrate  the principle in action:Okay, but isn't building too much stuff bad for the environment? Won't this encourage over-development? By George, no. What's bad for the environment is sprawl,  which the current system encourages and which the land tax would  directly attack. If you want dense, walkable cities that don't depend on  cars to get around, you should eliminate land speculation.A  stronger objection to land value tax is when it's not some shifty  speculator or a genocidal English landlord who suffers the brunt of it,  but, say, this guy:The premise of Pixar's movie Up is  that Carl Fredricksen, a lovably grumpy pensioner, is the last holdout  standing in the way of developers bulldozing the rest of his  neighborhood in the name of Progressxe2x84xa2. He refuses to sell because he  can't bear to part with the house which for him is tied up with all the  cherished memories of his departed wife.This isn't just sentimental fiction, this is something that really does happen.Isn't  Georgism just going to price the poor Carl Fredricksens out of their  homes so that someone with a more \"\"\"productive\"\"\" use can have it  instead?There's several good response to this.For  starters, if you're worried about kindly old people losing their homes,  that's a thing that's happening already, and most of the time it's  because The Rent Is Too Damn High, and our existing system is net worse  on this score. We are currently facing an unprecedented crisis of evictions  in tandem with the COVID pandemic, and it's not like things were peachy  before. And even though homelessness seems to be declining in the US  overall, it's getting worse in the most prosperous cities, exactly as George predicted.Okay, maybe it's better for renters, but what about people who own their homes, like Carl? Isn't it unfair to stick them with land taxes that might kick them out? What if they're retired?Remember, let's not confuse land tax with land confiscation, Here's George (emphases mine):I  do not propose either to purchase or to confiscate private property in  land. The first would be unjust; the second, needless. Let the  individuals who now hold it still retain, if they want to, possession of  what they are pleased to call their land. Let them continue to call it  their land. let them buy and sell, and bequeath and devise it. We  may safely leave them the shell, if we take the kernel. It is not  necessary to confiscate land; it is only necessary to confiscate rent.Okay,  but you have to admit that even if the state isn't confiscating  everybody's land, if you can't pay your land taxes you have no choice  but to sell your land, right? Isn't this morally unjust to the Carl Fredricksens of the world?First,  it's not a given that Mr. Fredricksen will be worse off on net: he  already pays income and sales taxes, capital gains on any investments,  as well as property tax which taxes both land value and the  value of his house. As speculators leave the real estate market the land  tax that replaces his property tax drop will drop, and his house is an  improvement that goes entirely untaxed. Also, if the speculators  holding onto all the most valuable real estate in the downtown districts  are forced to give it up, there won't be as much competition for land  and so there's a good chance developers won't be interested in trying to  buy up land in a bedroom community in the first place.BlueRepublik  further points out that LVT can be used to fund a Universal Basic  Income, which should soften the blow considerably:Keep  in mind also that the Georgist Land Value Tax is pair with a \"Citizen's  Dividend\" or what we see as UBI, so that it's not the government  claiming land rent, rather the land rent is taxed and split up equally  for all men.But as a matter of political practicality,  in the rare event that after all that Mr. Fredricksen still somehow  finds himself in the hole after LVT is applied, Nate Blair suggests a  deferment option to grandfather the Carls of the world through the  transition:The LVT gets assessed annually for everyone,  but owner occupiers (businesses and homeowners) can apply to defer the sum of those payments until they sell or transfer the land. Government can charge a nominal interest.A final point of modern  application of land value taxes is to level the playing field between  different areas by eliminating \"cost of living\" discrepancies that arise  entirely from speculative rent. This is pretty relevant given the \"location pay\" debate going on in Silicon Valley right now in response to increased remote work as a direct consequence of the COVID pandemic.Back to George.Great, we've taxed ground rent at 100% and eliminated speculation and all other manner of social ills. Now what do we do with the money?Lots of things!For  one, you can get rid of some other taxes. Back in George's day it was  even argued that a 100% land value tax on ground rents should be the only  tax xe2x80x93 the \"Single Tax,\" replacing all other tariffs, duties, and other  taxes (keep in mind this was in the late 1800's and Federal income tax  wasn't introduced until the 16th amendment in 1913). Remember,  all these other taxes have deadweight loss. Income tax is a tax on  labor, and so taxing it means we really do get less productive labor.  The portion of property tax that targets improvements punishes you for  investing in improvements, and sales tax is just straight up regressive,  hitting the poor harder than the rich.There's some argument  today about whether the \"Single Tax\" would be enough to fund the modern  US budget, with some Georgists saying it would be sufficient and others  saying we would still need some other taxes but could at least  significantly offset what we already have.But by George, another  thing we could do is just give all the money back to the people, as  BlueRepublik mentioned above. This could be used as a straightforward  Universal Basic Income xe2x80x93 what George calls a Citizen's Dividend, or what Andrew Yang calls the Freedom Dividend.  It could also be used for the funding of public goods. George doesn't  see this as an act of charity on the state's behalf xe2x80x93 the value of the  land has its origin in the productive labors of the entire community, so  it's a simple act of justice to give the returns to those who actually  produced the value, which is society at large.Another effect  George asserts is that once land is no longer monopolized, labor is no  longer forced into one-sided competition, so wages start to go up. Even  better, laborers now have far more opportunity to go into business for  themselves, which spurs innovation and investment.So to sum up, if we tax the ever loving hell out of ground rent, George says we'll see the following benefits:Make housing much more affordableEliminate perverse incentives and speculationEncourage the most efficient use of landEnd wage slavery and rack-rentsEncourage investment and innovationFund a Universal Basic Income and public goodsLower or eliminate some other unpopular taxesNot hand everything over to a centralized planned economy that probably won't workThe Rent is Too Damn High, but, by George,it doesn't have to be.Complete list of works by Henry GeorgeWikipedia article on Georgism and Land Value TaxGeorgism / LVT FAQ by @BlueRepublikNo, Georgism is Still Sane by @BlueRepublikWelfare Economics of the Land Value Tax by @BlueRepublikIf the Land Tax Is Such A Good Idea, Why Isnxe2x80x99t It Being Implemented? by Strong TownsThe Consequences of Land Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms,and Slums and Luxury in the Cities by Upton SinclairWikipedia article on DistributismFront Porch Republic on DistributismGeorgism and Distributism by John MedailleTowards a Truly Free Market by John MedailleThese are optional elaborations on sections I glossed over because the Book Review Is Too Damn Long. Malthusianism in George's time was wildly popular, and often invoked by the ascendant proponents of Social Darwinism who took Charles Darwin's theory of \"survival of the fittest\" and recast it as a moral justification for the Just World Hypothesis.  Essentially, those that are doing well do so because they are more  \"fit\", and those that are less \"fit\" tend to perish, and furthermore,  this brutal process will actively \"improve\" the human race. This  philosophy was the energizing intellectual force behind both the Eugenics movement and Nazi Germany.George clearly hates everything about this philosophy but attempts to steel-man it anyways:The Malthusian doctrine, as at present held, may be thus stated in its strongest and least objectionable form:That  population, constantly tending to increase, must, when unrestrained,  ultimately press against the limits of subsistence, not as against a  fixed, but as against an elastic barrier, which makes the procurement of  subsistence progressively more and more difficult. And thus, wherever  reproduction has had time to assert its power, and is unchecked by  prudence, there must exist that degree of want which will keep  population within the bounds of subsistence.The weak  form of Malthusianism is \"people are as dumb as deer and will breed  endlessly until there's not enough food and everyone starves to death.\"The  strong form of Malthusianism is, \"of course people aren't mindless deer  charging into a brick wall, but there is a firm upper limit that can  only give so much before nature will cull the herd without mercy.\"And by George, we can't just dismiss the strong form out of hand: \"what seems clearer than that there are too many people?\"However,  George is suspicious of how easily the Malthusian theory justifies  contemporary economic assumptions and assuages the moral sensibilities  of the establishment:The great cause of the triumph of  this theory is that, instead of menacing any vested right or  antagonizing any powerful interest, it is eminently soothing and  reassuring to the classes who, wielding the power of wealth, largely  dominate thought... It furnishes a philosophy by which Dives as he  feasts can shut out the image of Lazarus who faints with hunger at his  door;He points out how it lets self-styled \"Good Christian Men\" reframe their own greed and indifference as just plain good sense:In  this view, he who in the midst of want has accumulated wealth, has but  fenced in a little oasis from the driving sand which else would have  overwhelmed it. He has gained for himself, but has hurt nobody. And even  if the rich were literally to obey the injunctions of Christ and divide  their wealth among the poor, nothing would be gained.(Aside: I've heard this exact defense offered by many of my fellow Christians)Okay, George makes a strong moral case.  But a moral case isn't enough, and I think this is where many activists  of all political stripes go wrong. If you attack the premises of an  idea as \"dangerous\" because it could lead to bad consequences, you're  still stuck with a real problem if the premises that animate that  \"dangerous\" idea turn out to be actually true. If they're true  we're stuck with them, and unless your competing policy admits to the  same grim facts, your opponent will just dismiss your entire argument  and more importantly, so will their audience.But if the premises aren't true, then the dangerous and scary policy prescription xe2x80x93 say, \"let the Irish starve to death\" xe2x80x93 is both evil and unnecessary. History has shown that many officials will shrug their shoulders at \"evil\" policies so long as they believe them to be \"necessary.\"Cool, we've established that Malthusianism is bad. Now let's establish that it's wrong.From where we're sitting in 2021, we don't even need George to refute Malthusianism, history has done that for us.Instead of increasing at an exponential rate, fertility rates are crashing all over the world. Not in one country, but in virtually every country,  and in many the birth rate is already below replacement. Fertility  rates have been crashing so hard that some are calling it a \"Global Fertility Crisis.\" The absolute size of the human population is still growing, but this is just due to inertia; the human population will peak somewhere between 9 and 10 billion in the 2060's, and then decline from there.The two main things Malthus got wrong were failing to anticipate 1) advances in food production technology like the Green Revolution, and 2) that humans can control their own fertility rates.George's strongest arguments against Malthusianism strike directly at the provably false claims of its 19th century proponents and provide some extremely salient applications of George's philosophy.George  takes up the cause of India, China, and Ireland, which were often cited  as examples of \"overpopulated\" countries where many have starved and  been forced to emigrate. Per the Malthusians, this is the fault of too  many of these poor, ignorant, and deficient people crammed together in  too small a space.By George, it can't be the fault of population density xe2x80x93 in his time, Germany, Belgium, England, Netherlands and Italy all have higher population  densities than India, China, and Ireland, and could therefore support  higher populations with the right conditions. And there's certainly  nothing wrong with the people themselves:This arises  from no innate deficiency in the people, for the Hindoo, as comparative  philology has shown, is of our own blood, and China possessed a high  degree of civilization and the rudiments of the most important modern  inventions when our ancestors were wandering savages.Instead:It  arises from the form which the social organization has in both  countries taken, which has shackled productive power and robbed industry  of its reward.India is poor not because it has too many Indians, but because it is oppressed by too many Englishmen:The  millions of India have bowed their necks beneath the yokes of many  conquerors, but worse of all is the steady grinding weight of English  domination... India now is like a great estate owned by an absentee and  alien landlordGeorge gives us lots of details about the  plight of India, China, and Ireland, but for the sake of brevity I'm  just going to present the heartbreaking case of the Great Irish Potato Famine and let it stand in for all three.To sum up, from 1845 to 1852 there was a period of mass starvation and disease in Ireland. About one million people died, and another million fled the country. The entire population dropped by about 25%:The  extreme poverty of the peasantry and the low rate of wages there  prevailing, the Irish famine, and Irish emigration, are constantly  referred to as a demonstration of the Malthusian theory worked out under  the eyes of the civilized world.Many prominent  intellectuals of the day looked at the crisis, shook their heads, and  said xe2x80x93 what do you expect when those ignorant Irish Catholics breed like  rabbits and strain Ireland's carrying capacity to its limit? It's just  natural selection at work!George will have none of it:The  laborer was just as effectually stripped by as merciless a horde of  landlords, among whom the soil had been divided as their absolute  possession, regardless of any rights of those who lived upon it.Okay,  they had to pay some rent, so what? Didn't they bring their suffering  on themselves? Why, the intellectuals ask, didn't the Irish work harder,  why did they not improve their local economy and agricultural base? And  most importantly, why did they depend on a single monoculture crop (the  potato) if a single blight could knock out their entire food supply?By George, because The Rent Was Too Damn High!tenants... even if the rack-rents which they were forced to pay had permitted them, did not dare to make improvements which would have been but the signal for an increase of rent. Labor was thus applied in the most inefficient and wasteful manner.(emphases mine)The Irish were really trapped. Working harder to improve the farmland to increase its yield could actually leave them worse off.  Any increase in their land's productivity goes to the landlord in the  form of increased rents. But even this structural impoverishment of the  land wasn't sufficient to cause the famine. Ireland still produced  enough food to feed its people:For when her population  was at its highest, Ireland was a food-exporting country. Even during  the famine, grain and meat and butter and cheese were carted for  exportation along roads lined with the starving and past trenches in  which the dead were piled.People were literally starving  and dying, but because of the structure of land ownership they couldn't  even pay their rent, let alone purchase the food grown from their own  lands and raised with their own hands. Since the local population  couldn't afford it, the (English) landlords sold it abroad to the  highest bidder. It went not as an exchange, but as a  tribute xe2x80x93 to pay the rent of absentee landlords; a levy wrung from  producers by those who in no wise contributed to production... they  lived on the potato, because rack-rents stripped everything else from  them.The Rent Is Too Damn High, and it's not because the  designated underclass of the day have too many babies or are too  uneducated, too ignorant, too religious, too lazy, or too foreign.George gets really  mad about this, and calls out John Stuart Mill and Henry Thomas Buckle  by name for lending credence to the Malthusian explanation of Ireland's  suffering.I know of nothing better calculated to make  the blood boil than the cold accounts of the grasping, grinding tyranny  to which the Irish people have been subjected, and to which, and not to  any inability of the land to support its population, Irish pauperism and  Irish famine are to be attributed; and were it not for the enervating  effect which the history of the world proves to be everywhere the result  of abject poverty, it would be difficult to resist something like a  feeling of contempt for a race who, stung by such wrongs, have only  occasionally murdered a landlord!Conventional Law 1: Wages aredetermined by the ratio between capital devoted to the payment & subsistence of labor, divided up by the number of laborers.Conventional Law 2: Rent is determined by something called the \"margin of production,\" AKA the \"margin of cultivation.\" What's that?Let L be some land.Let W be the worst land available.Let A = the produce L makes. Let B = the produce you get applying the same amount of labor and capital to W. The Rent of L is given by A - B.The  margin of production/cultivation is the difference between how much you  can produce from a particular piece of land compared to the least  productive alternative.This is the only conventional law of distribution that George accepts as correct.Conventional Law 3: Interest  is the ratio between capital demanded by borrowers and supplied by  lenders, falling as wages rise and vice versa. To quote Mill, interest  is determined \"by the cost of labor to the capitalist.\"The  problem with these three laws is if Land, Labor, and Capital are the  only three factors of production, and each gets its own return, than the  three returns should balance. In other words:Return to Production = Rent + Wages + InterestIf  your three returns sum to more or less than 100% of the return to  production, something's off, and George says the old laws don't add up xe2x80x93  the only one of these he accepts is the law of rent. What's wrong with  the other two?First we've got to stop using \"profits\" to mean a  return to capital. If we look into a profit stream, we see more than one  kind of thing. Conventional economists list the following:Wages of \"superintendence\"Compensation for riskReturn for the use of capital\"Superintendence\" is a fancy word for management. White-collar though it may be, it's still labor, and it's compensation is wages. That's not a return to capital.As  for compensation for risk, George says that risk averages out and  disappears when you take the God's eye view and sum all of society's  transactions together. If I take the winning side of a bet and you take  the losing side, I enjoy gain, you suffer loss, but the amount of wealth  in the world hasn't actually increased as a result of our bet.That leaves return for the use of capital, which George calls interest.\"I  shall therefore, consistently with the definitions of political  economists, use the term interest as signifying that part of the produce  which goes to capital.\"Things we've already tried that George says aren't sufficient:Austerity measures & smaller governmentImproved education & worker trainingLabor unionsCo-opsGovernment redistribution of wealthLand redistributionWhy they're insufficient:Austerity  & smaller government may help balance the budget, but it is not  government spending but rather rent that limits workers' wages.Education  can help an individual, but when land is monopolized workers still  compete with each other for labor, so if you send everyone to college  all that's changed is now the minimum requirement for every job is a  bachelor's degree, and rent still limits wages. What about vocational  schools and direct worker training? Even if these are more relevant to  teaching relevant skills that raise productivity, the same thing  happens; land is monopolized, laborers compete with one another, rent  soaks up the gains.Unions can actually increase wages, because  it's one of the few forces strong enough to stand against the power of  rent. The problem is that unions face a never-ending uphill battle. We  often think of \"labor versus capital\" but what we often call \"capital\"  is just landowners in disguise (because conventional theories include  land as a kind of capital). And landowners have a huge structural  advantage in negotiations. Labor is the most vulnerable and will quickly  starve if idle, but idle capital likewise earns nothing and is actively  eaten away by maintenance costs and depreciation. Landowners however  can just sit back and collect rent. Given that land is fixed, it's way  easier for landowners to collude than it is for either labor or capital  (sans land) to unionize.Co-ops come in two forms: supplier co-ops  and producer/worker-owner co-ops. The former can only lower the cost of  exchanges by cutting out middlemen, and the latter just changes the  structure of wages (profit-sharing instead of fixed pay). These are good  things that help, but don't attack land monopoly and thus can't resist  the power of rent.Government redistribution of wealth through  high taxes (presumably income or wealth) have two well known problems.  First, you massively increase the size and scope of government, inviting  corruption, an invasive surveillance state, and power-hungry  politicians. Second, by taxing income or wealth you're also taxing  production, creating \"Deadweight loss.\" Also, given labor and capital  can move, if you try to tax them more than they like they will just go  somewhere else (note that land alone cannot do this). George  grants that this kind of brute-force redistributive policy may well be  better than the status quo, but we can do a lot better. George further  predicts that trying to implement Socialism will lead to demagoguery and  dictatorship in actual practice. He admires the ideal, but says that  such a society must \"grow\" rather than be \"manufactured.\"As for  land distribution, George finds fault with it. No matter how you tinker  with the rules of who can own land and how or whether it can be sold, in  the long run every system tends towards the consolidation of land  ownership. Even if you go to the extreme, chop it all up and parcel it  out, ownership will inevitably concentrate again.Ultimately  George says all of these remedies are insufficient because they don't  address land monopoly and do little or nothing to attack the power of  rent.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Your Book Review: Progress And Poverty - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty"}

Centuries of utopian communes, micronations, and seasteads have dreamed of rebuilding society from first principles, free from entrenched interests and the debris of the past. If you got all the laws and values just right, maybe you could prevent poverty and corruption from finding their first footholds. Do the \"liberty and justice for all\" thing, but for real.And who among us, having had the dream, hasn't entered into multi-year negotiations with the government of Honduras? Taken advantage of a clause in the Honduras-Kuwait Treaty Of Reciprocal Investment guaranteeing them their right to pursue their vision unmolested? Raised millions in venture capital and bought land on a Caribbean island to turn it into a reality?Not Erick Brimen, and not Honduras Prxc3xb3spera Inc. You might have read about them last month in Bloomberg: A Private Tech City Opens For Business In Honduras. Or in NACLA: A Private Government In Honduras Moves Forward. Or FT: An Investor's Prosperity Vision For Honduras. I read all of this and still didn't feel like I quite understood what was going on. Then a fortuitious mistake led me to an email exchange with Trey Goff, Prxc3xb3spera's extremely open and thorough Chief of Staff, who kindly let me grill him on all the stuff I didn't understand.The result is this post. It's all the information I could collect on Prxc3xb3spera from basically every public source, plus some non-public ones. It's about a private tech city and a prosperity vision and all that. But it's also about - - - well, people talk a lot these days about xe2x80x9csystemic changexe2x80x9d. But usually that means something like fiddling with tax rates or ending the filibuster. What if you could actually change the system? Say \"this system we have, the one that's letting all these people starve and suffer violence and die of preventable diseases - I don't care for it. Let's try something else\"? Yes, this is about startup governments and investment opportunities and blah blah blah, but it's also about trying to fight global poverty by radically changing the rules of the game that makes it possible.Also, it will look like this:So, starting from the beginning:1. What is this? Whatxe2x80x99s a ZEDE? Whatxe2x80x99s going on? Where am I?In 2009, Nobel-winning economist Paul Romer proposed a new type of governance structure. Underdeveloped countries looking for an economic boost could donate territory to some entity considered non-corrupt and skilled at governance  - for example, a successful country like Switzerland. The recipient entity would govern the territory as effectively as it could, bringing improved human rights and economic growth.  If this went well, it could be win-win-win. The region's citizens would get good governance, safety and wealth. The underdeveloped donor country would get to skim a little off the top as taxes, plus the downstream benefits of having a well-developed economic hub in their country. And the successful recipient country would get bragging rights, investment opportunities, and comparatively cheap labor.Honduras - with 70% of its population in poverty, the 5th highest murder rate in the world, and a political system widely recognized as corrupt and dysfunctional - was running low on options. They approached Romer and expressed interest in his idea. Together, Romer and Honduran officials developed the ZEDE (Spanish acronym for \"Zone for Employment and Economic Development\"), a generic model for creating special economic zones (\"charter cities\") within Honduras.1.1. Sounds nice and straightforward, I guess?Nope, the original implementation of the ZEDE law was a disaster.In 2009, Honduras' leftist-ish President Manuel Zelaya proposed a referendum to change the Constitution, which his opponents interpreted as a plot to remove term limits and rule indefinitely. The Supreme Court ruled against him, Zelaya ordered the military to assist in holding the referendum anyway, the military held a coup instead. They appointed the next person in the line of succession the interim president, then held tense elections which were partially boycotted by Zelaya supporters and of debated legitimacy. Conservative candidate Porfirio Lobo Sosa won and became president. Lobo's chief of staff Octavio Sanchez stumbled upon the TED talk where Romer discussed charter cities and invited him to Honduras for negotiations.Lobo's party controlled Congress and got a charter city law passed. After this the story gets kind of murky. Paul Romer's version was that they appointed him head of a Transparency Committee to make sure that whatever happened was in the best interests of Honduras, then started negotiating with a company called MKG Group without telling him. Upset at the opacity, and also at the negotiations themselves (he preferred having a foreign country administer the zones, not a private corporation), he resigned in protest. Honduras' version is that Romer was never appointed head of anything and there was no Transparency Committee.Attention turned to a definitely-existing group called the Committee For Best Practices (CAMP in Spanish) which was handling the day-to-day negotiations. But its members seemed to have been hand-picked to raise eyebrows. They included Ronald Reaganxe2x80x99s adopted son, the foreign minister of Oman, US low tax campaigner Grover Norquist, and - in case there was a single conspiracy theorist anywhere in the world not already on high alert - a member of the Habsburg family. I would say this raises a lot of questions, but really the only question anyone had at the time was xe2x80x9cwhat?xe2x80x9dIn the midst of all this, the Honduran Supreme Court struck down the charter city law 4-1 because they thought it threatened Honduras' sovereignty. This became part of a broader conflict in Honduran politics, which came to a head after the Supreme Court struck down a major police reform bill. Congress fired the four anti-government Supreme Court justices and replaced them with pro-government ones; opinions on the constitutionality of the move range from unclear to extremely skeptical. There was a big crisis for a while, various factions accused various other factions of plotting coups, but the government made it through. Three years later, they tried again with a ZEDE law, this one slightly amended to make it clear that the areas were still ultimately under Honduran sovereignty. The new packed-with-government-supporters Supreme Court pronounced it okay, and the law passed with the support of 78% (!) of Congress. They dismissed the old CAMP members and replaced them with people apparently inoffensive enough that nobodyxe2x80x99s reported on who they are (I think one of them might be this guy).  After various other failed projects and false starts, we come to Prxc3xb3spera and the present.1.2. Could this work?Maybe.Proponents point out that the idea of a ZEDE or charter city is similar to (in fact, stronger than) the idea of a special economic zone, which transformed the cities of Shenzhen in China and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.You could tell similar stories about the success of Hong Kong and Singapore, two other polities with little to recommend themselves other than a different and more competent regime than the surrounding regions.The idea behind charter cities is: Shenzhen, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the rest of the rich world arenxe2x80x99t rich because their citizens are morally superior to those of their poorer neighbors. Theyxe2x80x99re rich because they have better legal systems, less corruption, stronger rule of law, and more competent administrators.  And poor countries donxe2x80x99t have corruption, crime, and incompetence because they choose to. They have those things because vested interests, zero-sum games, and poor education make it hard to improve things. If you could get part of a poor country to be under a rich-country-style government, it too could get rich the same way all those other places did.Honduras allowed ZEDEs in order test this hypothesis and see if it offered a radical solution to poverty.2. So what is Prxc3xb3spera?Prxc3xb3spera is Hondurasxe2x80x99 first ZEDE.In one sense, Prxc3xb3spera is a 58 acre tract of unoccupied land on the island of Roatan, between a fishing village and a golf course. 58 acres is small; the nearby golf course is bigger.So far there are three buildings on the land. Theyxe2x80x99re called the Beta Buildings, because theyxe2x80x99re a beta test of whether people could actually build things under Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s building code.Right now this is just a sort of testbed. Eventually, Prxc3xb3spera plans to buy up most of the land between Palmetto Bay and the golf course (though not the area marked Crawfish Rock, which is already a separate town). That would make it about a square mile in size - a little smaller than New Yorkxe2x80x99s Central Park.But thatxe2x80x99s only the beginning. Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s not a place, itxe2x80x99s a platform. Itxe2x80x99s a government with a charter, laws, legislators, officials, contracts, partnerships, etc. Anywhere can become part of Prxc3xb3spera - if someone has land in a totally different part of Honduras and wants to be part of Prxc3xb3spera they can. So far this one tract on Roatan is the only place thatxe2x80x99s signed on, but that could change.The Prxc3xb3sperans use the metaphor of a string of pearls. They expect to eventually control several noncontiguous enclaves within Honduras, the same way the US controls the contiguous 48 states, Hawaii, and Alaska, separated by ocean and foreign territory but still part of the same structure.Whatxe2x80x99s to stop this from getting really weird? Can I have my house be in Prxc3xb3spera while my neighborxe2x80x99s house is in regular Honduras? My kitchen in Prxc3xb3spera but my dining room in regular Honduras? I asked Trey, who said HPI has to guarantee provision of services to everywhere within Prxc3xb3spera; they wouldnxe2x80x99t expect providing services to somebodyxe2x80x99s dining room to be worth it, and so they would turn down those kinds of frivolous applicants. Their plan is for a network of hubs, each city-sized and relatively convenient to provide for. Theyxe2x80x99ve already selected an area near the city of La Ceiba as their first satellite, and eventually want to expand across Hondurasxe2x80x99 north coast.Aren't these a bit far away from each other? Wouldnxe2x80x99t it be hard to run a single polity on so many unconnected islands and enclaves? From the white paper:  Prxc3xb3spera is well versed on the myriad environmental, climate, and humanitarian concerns with automobile traffic. As such, Prxc3xb3spera hopes to enable the creation of the world's first truly affordable and safe air taxi system between its various Prosperity Hubs through the use of VTOL drones.But before we get ahead of ourselves, remember that right now, in the real world, itxe2x80x99s a tract of land somewhat smaller than a golf course, with approximately three buildings on it. The main building looks like this:3. Whoxe2x80x99s doing this?In the original plan, charter cities would be governed by some respected and competent foreign power like Switzerland. That fell apart for various reasons (worries about national sovereignty and colonialism, no sign Switzerland actually wanted to help) and the new version is that they'll be governed by a corporation full of visionaries and experts and other hopefully non-corrupt people. The corporation will only make money if the ZEDE becomes economically productive, corporations seem to like making money, so in theory this gives them an incentive to govern wisely.The particular corporation involved in Prxc3xb3spera is Honduras Prxc3xb3spera Inc (after this: HPI), and its founder and CEO is Erick Brimen.Brimen comes from Venezuela, where he briefly flirted with socialism and Chavismo as a teenager before xe2x80x9crealityxe2x80xa6opened my eyes to just how wrong I wasxe2x80x9d. He emigrated to the United States, entered finance, rose through the ranks, founded an insurance company in Colombia, and eventually started a xe2x80x9csocial impact investingxe2x80x9d corporation called NEWay Capital to promote growth in Latin America. Prxc3xb3spera started out as one of NEWayxe2x80x99s projects and quickly grew into a separate and more ambitious company.NEWay is barely five years old, has single-digit to low double-digit employees, and seems to deal with sums of money in the single-digit millions. They hardly seem like the sort of people that you would expect to see founding their own city. Is there anybody else involved?HPI is getting some funding from Pronomos Capital, who are exactly the sort of people you would expect to see founding their own city. Pronomos is a group of Silicon Valley libertarians interested in competitive governance; their site predicts \"crowd choice in governance providers, new startup societies approved by existing states, and completely new developments in unclaimed areas such as the high seas or celestial bodies\". Some of them are veterans of the Seasteading Institute, who wanted to create charter cities on floating platforms in international waters. Pronomos is run by former SI head Patri Friedman (grandson of Milton Friedman, son of David Friedman), and their advisors include cryptocurrency mogul / VC / outspoken libertarian Balaji Srinivasan, legendary venture capitalist Naval Ravikant, and lots of other apparently rich and famous people who I know less about. I think we would all be disappointed in Peter Thiel if he were not involved in this somehow, and it looks like in fact hexe2x80x99s a major Pronomos funder.But as far as I can tell, the big-name billionaires are only providing the money. Weird as it sounds, Prxc3xb3spera is mostly the project of a small company, started by a Venezuelan guy whoxe2x80x99s really passionate about helping Latin America.  3.1. Do they, uh, have a track record of building successful cities?Actually, some of them do! Theyxe2x80x99ve collected advisors from some of the most influential private city projects of the past few decades.Jeff Singer is the former CEO of Dubai International Financial Center Authority, the charter-city-like legal zone at the heart of Dubai; Chirag Shah is another member of Dubaixe2x80x99s executive team. During their administration, Dubai got the world's tallest building, the worldxe2x80x99s largest shopping mall, the worldxe2x80x99s largest theme park, the worldxe2x80x99s busiest international travel hub, the worldxe2x80x99s largest painting, and the worldxe2x80x99s largest chocolate sculpture of the worldxe2x80x99s tallest building in the worldxe2x80x99s busiest international travel hub.Oliver Porter is the architect of the Sandy Springs model, named after the city of Sandy Springs, Georgia. This is an interesting rabbit hole in itself - Sandy Springs incorporated in a hurry, didnxe2x80x99t have time to create its own city services, hired private corporations to do everything, then liked it so much that they advertised themselves as a libertarian paradise and a model for everyone else to follow (though see here for another perspective).Tom Murcott was an investment officer for Songdo, a South Korean charter city which now has 50,000 people, a thousand-foot-tall skyscraper, the headquarters of the UNxe2x80x99s Green Climate Fund, and a pneumatic waste disposal system  - instead of leaving cans out for the garbage truck, you throw your trash directly into pressurized tubes that suck it to the recycling center or incinerator.  The HPI team also has a bunch of lawyers, consultants, diplomats, architects, and enterpreneurs. So, so many entrepreneurs.  5. Who will live in Prxc3xb3spera?Prxc3xb3spera expects 10,000 residents by 2025.Theyxe2x80x99re especially focusing on Honduran professionals and remote workers - the more remote, the easier a time theyxe2x80x99ll have moving to a new city on an island. But theyxe2x80x99re also interested in poorer Hondurans looking for construction and service jobs, and expats after a slice of paradise on a tropical beach.  Interested? All you need to do is sign the social contract, pay the membership fee, get Honduran residency (they promise itxe2x80x99s pretty easy, and they have lawyers who can help) and youxe2x80x99re good to go.Wait, sign the social contract? Yes. Contra your Political Science professor, therexe2x80x99s a literal social contract which you literally sign (officially: \"Agreement Of Coexistence...which stipulates that the resident is explicitly, freely, and voluntarily consenting to the governance structures, rulemaking systems, and authority of Prxc3xb3spera\").And wait, membership fee? Yes. Itxe2x80x99s $260/year for Hondurans, $1300 for foreigners, maybe more for corporations. This is separate from normal taxes, and goes to HPI as part of their compensation for running the ZEDE.Are people actually up for this? HPI says a thousand Hondurans have already applied. Since therexe2x80x99s currently only one building complex in Prxc3xb3spera, it's safe to say that the supply of interested residents will be exceeding demand for a long time.In case demand ever exceeds supply, HPI is already reaching out to NGOs that work with Honduran refugees trying to illegally immigrate to America. They plan to see if they can convince these people to legally immigrate to Prxc3xb3spera instead (xe2x80x9cHey, we heard you liked jobs and capitalism...xe2x80x9d)August 3rd 2020Interested parties who donxe2x80x99t want to move to Roatan can seek xe2x80x9cvirtual residencyxe2x80x9d / xe2x80x9ce-residencyxe2x80x9d, a concept pioneered by Estonia in 2014. This mostly allows virtual residents to set up companies in Prxc3xb3spera, governed by Prxc3xb3speran law. In keeping with their usual modus operandi, HPI has already hired Ott Vatter, the leader of the Estonian project, to design their system.6. Will Prxc3xb3spera be a libertarian / anarcho-capitalist utopia?Sort of but not really.The people behind Prxc3xb3spera are mostly libertarians, but theyxe2x80x99re trying to avoid using the word xe2x80x9clibertarianxe2x80x9d too much when talking about their project. Partly because the libertarian brand scares people. But partly because their vision is more complicated than just small government.Charter cities fall into an awkward crack in libertarian ideology. Almost every libertarian agrees that you can make rules (even arbitrary rules) about what people can do on your own property, and anyone who wants to stay on your property has to follow your rules. But whatxe2x80x99s the difference between that, versus a government xe2x80x9cowningxe2x80x9d its territory and making rules for its citizens? In practice the difference is that going in someonexe2x80x99s house - or even their golf course - is a choice you made, and they have clear title of ownership. But being in a country happens involuntarily, and the President doesnxe2x80x99t xe2x80x9cownxe2x80x9d America in the same way an ordinary person might own a house.But if someone did own an entire city, and you chose to be in that city, theoretically they should be able to make whatever laws they wanted, and not even the most zealous libertarian could protest. The issue hadnxe2x80x99t really come up before. But here we are.Prxc3xb3spera is erring on the side of small government, because thatxe2x80x99s what they expect will work best. But their overriding motive is making their city a nice place to live and work, and when small government conflicts with that, the city usually wins.  So for example, when you buy land in Prxc3xb3spera, youxe2x80x99ll have to sign a Covenant Restricting Vice Industry Uses - ie you canxe2x80x99t turn your house into a joint brothel+casino and do unethical medical experiments in the basement. Even the strictest libertarian has to admit this is fair; if you sign a contract, youxe2x80x99ve got to follow it. But you can tell HPI plans to have the town be ship-shape, well-organized, and family-friendly, instead of the sort of Wild West vibe some people associate libertarianism with.Also, Prxc3xb3spera remains bound by several Honduran laws that Honduras refuses to exempt them from, including laws against abortion, euthanasia, and most gun ownership.6.1. But theyxe2x80x99ll at least have really low taxes, right?The lowest in the world.The Prxc3xb3spera Charter declares that income taxes cannot exceed 10%; anyone who wants to raise taxes above that will have to pass a full constitutional amendment in a system deliberately designed to be hard to change. There are also some other minor taxes, but the Charter says that (after certain conditions are met) total taxes may never exceed 7.5% of GDP, and total debt may not exceed 20% of GDP (with various specifications and caveats). From HPI documentation:  This is a key improvement upon the American system, as unlimited debt can potentially lead to untenable fiscal situations which threaten the economic health, stability, and shared prosperity of the jurisdictionWhere do the taxes go?- 12% go to Honduras, as their incentive for allowing ZEDEs at all - 44% go to the General Service Provider, a private company that handles things like sanitation and power. This will probably be an HPI subsidiary which subcontracts out to Jacobs Engineering, the same company that did a lot of the work in Sandy Springs. - 44% go to the Prxc3xb3spera municipal government, to handle whatever services they canxe2x80x99t subcontract out.How does HPI make money? They get a cut of the membership fees and the General Service Provider money, but their real cash cow is probably land development. They buy empty land, develop it into a thriving city, then sell it to people who want to live in thriving cities at a huge markup. The more thriving the city, the higher the land value, and the more money HPI makes - which they think puts the incentives in the right place.7.Okay, but what will Prxc3xb3spera be like?So some businesspeople have gotten a once-in-a-lifetime chance to design a utopian city of the future from the ground up. The Honduras government will let them do great innovative things. Theyxe2x80x99re incentivized to do great innovative things. They have enough money and talent to be able to do great innovative things. What particular kinds of great innovative things are they planning to do?Going through the list:7.1. What will the houses in Prxc3xb3spera be like?Modular, customizable, community-oriented, and beautiful.Patrick Schumacher is the Principal Architect of Zaha Hadid, a world-famous architectural firm that designed eg Beijing International Airport and the London Olympicsxe2x80x99 Aquatics Center. Hexe2x80x99s won some of architecturexe2x80x99s most prestigious prizes, but also faced controversy over views his Wikipedia page describes as xe2x80x9caligned with anarcho-capitalism in favour of complete decentralisation and radical privatisation of all aspects of architecture, planning and developmentxe2x80x9d. He recently lost a court case over ownership of his architecture company, andxe2x80xa6wait, havenxe2x80x99t I read this Ayn Rand book before?Anyway, hexe2x80x99s embraced Prxc3xb3spera as a laboratory for some of his wilder ideas, and the results are pretty stunning: Prxc3xb3spera also promises an unprecedented level of customization. The houses are modular enough that you can design yours however you want. I havenxe2x80x99t been able to get access to the real program (called xe2x80x9cthe Configuratorxe2x80x9d) yet, but here are some apparent screenshots:How much will these cost? Trey estimates a starting price of $70K to buy or $450 - $600/month to rent for cheaper units. In a podcast, Erick Brimen gave some slightly different estimates for more expensive homes: $3750/m^2, with sizes ranging from 40 m^2 (small apartment) to 250 m^2 (large four bedroom house) - which would suggest prices from $150,000 to $950,000.  I get the impression that the pictures above are the Prxc3xb3speran equivalent of apartment buildings; Ixe2x80x99m not sure what their single-family houses are like. But Prxc3xb3spera is also interested in serving non-traditional living arrangements - group houses, co-living spaces, whole communities uprooting themselves and relocating to somewhere in Prxc3xb3spera theyxe2x80x99ve customized for their needs.  Making big promises and glossy images is easy, but for the record, Trey says that xe2x80x9c[these] renders should reflect the reality of the 58 acres by end of 2022xe2x80x9d.What about the poorest Honduran laborers who canxe2x80x99t afford $450/month? Trey writes:For blue collar laborers under even tighter economic circumstances, LAVA Architects in partnership with a Honduran architect have created something we call the Beta Residencies (for now), which can be built for less than $40k and in less than 60 days. These are specifically designed for very low-income Hondurans to be able to move in to Prxc3xb3spera alongside the wealthy expats, as urban planning literature shows having a diverse cross section of class and culture is important for community cohesion, especially early on when the community is just forming. Some of them are already built.Here they are:7.2. What will the education system be like?From their white paper:If some students are capable of learning two years of standard school mathematics in one year whereas other students can only learn half a year of standard mathematics in one year, personalized learning systems will allow schools to customize education for the needs of individual students. xe2x80x9cCompetency-basedxe2x80x9d refers to the fact that schools should focus on whether or not students have mastered the academic content rather than how many credit hours they have taken of a subject. The fact is some students are very fast in some subjects and slow in others, some students are fast in all subjects, and some students are slow in all subjects. Learning systems should reflect the diversity of student interests and abilities.As examples of what they like, they list every successful private school ever, including ones whose philosophies contradict each other, like Montessori and No Excuses (though I was also recently accused of doing this, so whatever).  Trey says theyxe2x80x99re negotiating with someone involved in Montessori schools to bring one to Prxc3xb3spera as their first educational institution.In terms of secondary education, they had a deal with Technical University of Munich, a very well regarded German university, but it looks like German leftists pressured them into withdrawing. Currently they are investigating a partnership with Universidad Francisco Marroquin, a libertarian university in Guatemala City which (for example) has a \"Ludwig von Mises library [which] has 100,000 visitors annually and is the most extensive collection of works on liberty in Latin America\", and whose alumni include eg one of Julian Assange's defense lawyers.7.3. What will the health care system be like?Prxc3xb3spera currently advertises a partnership with CEMESA Hospital, a nice and completely normal local hospital in Roatan that would be well-placed to expand into Prxc3xb3spera. But they also want to become a center of medical tourism, ie people going to foreign countries to get better or more affordable medical care than is available at home. Their Master Plan hopes to have a medical center like this available within the first few years.But letxe2x80x99s get to what I know youxe2x80x99re all here for - medical licensing policy. Prxc3xb3spera plans to be the first polity to allow complete medical reciprocity with all developed nations (plus Honduras). That means if youxe2x80x99re an American/French/Japanese/etc doctor with a valid American/French/Japanese/etc medical license, you are licensed to practice medicine in Prxc3xb3spera.This policy is close to my heart, because like many people Ixe2x80x99ve had Uber drivers who were doctors back in their home countries. Theyxe2x80x99re stuck driving Ubers because the US insists that nobody - not British doctors, not Canadian doctors, nobody - can work in the US unless they repeat their last four years of training in an American hospital. American hospitals donxe2x80x99t have many training positions, and reserve the ones they do have for American med students, so most of them canxe2x80x99t do it. Meanwhile, my patients complain of having to wait months to get a desperately-needed appointment, and the hospitals just say xe2x80x9cwell, there arenxe2x80x99t enough doctorsxe2x80x9d. There are, theyxe2x80x99re just all driving Ubers because of regulatory failure! Ixe2x80x99m not sure Prxc3xb3spera goes far enough - a lot of the real gains would come from allowing Indian or Iranian doctors - but go further than anywhere else.Likewise, Prxc3xb3spera has 100% drug approval reciprocity. If a drug has been approved in an OECD country (eg by the FDA), itxe2x80x99s approved in Prxc3xb3spera. Again, close to my heart. Amisulpride is a great antipsychotic, probably better then most of the ones we use here. Itxe2x80x99s approved in Europe, the UK, Australia, Israel, etc, where many studies have shown itxe2x80x99s safe and effective. Because none of those studies were done in the US, the FDA refuses to approve it here, and has demanded several hundred million dollars worth of more studies, which the company involved has chosen not to do (an injectable version was recently approved for nausea, but canxe2x80x99t be easily used for psychosis). Meanwhile, bupropion (xe2x80x9cWellbutrinxe2x80x9d), the fourth-most prescribed antidepressant in the US, isnxe2x80x99t approved for depression in Britain; the subset of patients who respond to this medication and nothing else are out of luck. Prxc3xb3spera will be one of the only places in the world where patients will have access to amisulpride, bupropion, and all the other medications that one country or another is restricting because xe2x80x9cit wasnxe2x80x99t invented herexe2x80x9d.7.3.1. How will hospitals and medical practices be regulated?The same way as everything else in Prxc3xb3spera - pick a country or get insurance.You can read the details in the Industrial Regulation Statute starting on page 317 of their law code , but I think the basics of xe2x80x9cpick a countryxe2x80x9d are - you can choose what countryxe2x80x99s regulations you want to operate under, with your options being Honduras or a list of Best Practice Peer Countries including:Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Dubai, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Singapore, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States of America  So if I open a medical practice in Prxc3xb3spera, I can look through everybodyxe2x80x99s medical regulation laws, decide Norwayxe2x80x99s laws suit my purposes best, and choose to be bound by the Norwegian regulatory code. Then I have to follow all the laws carefully like a good Norwegian. If I get in trouble, any disputes between me and my patients will be settled by Norwegian law.It actually goes further than this - you can choose to be in a particular location within a Best Practice Peer Country. Trey uses the example of a developer choosing to build a skyscraper using the laws of Houston, Texas. Since Houston is in America, a Best Practice Peer Country, the developer will be legally protected as long as they conform to Houstonxe2x80x99s building regulations.  And if you donxe2x80x99t like any countryxe2x80x99s regulations, but youxe2x80x99re confident in your ability to operate safely, you can take your chances. Anyone who doesnxe2x80x99t like what youxe2x80x99re doing can sue you under common law for any damage you cause, and you wonxe2x80x99t have xe2x80x9cI was following the regulationsxe2x80x9d as a defense.(speaking of suing people, the law code seems to cap damages from medical malpractice lawsuits at $250,000, which is a defensible choice, but sure not the direction that the US has gone here.)Everyone operating in Prxc3xb3spera will need insurance for any damages caused by their activities. This should be easy and cheap to get if youxe2x80x99re following strict regulations, harder and more expensive if youxe2x80x99re following lax regulations, and potentially prohibitive if youxe2x80x99re not following any regulations at all. The city will ensure most normal activities, but anyone who wants to do an abnormal activity - or shop around for a cheaper price - can contract with a private insurer instead.  The idea is to put the burden on insurance companies to figure out whether an industry is safe or dangerous. But it also gives companies a xe2x80x9cdefault yesxe2x80x9d regulatory option. If you invent the worldxe2x80x99s safest ultralight plane in the US, you still have to comply with various burdensome regulations about how you can use it. If you invent the worldxe2x80x99s safest ultralight plane in Prxc3xb3spera, you can prove to some insurance company that it really is as safe as you say, theyxe2x80x99ll insure it for relatively cheap, and then you can fly it to your heartxe2x80x99s content. If it crashes into someonexe2x80x99s house, the insurance company will pay damages. If it kills someone, the insurance company will pay a lot of damages. I hope Prxc3xb3spera has a good way of calculating how much.What if a regulatory issue canxe2x80x99t be expressed financially? I asked Trey about human genetic engineering. He said that extreme or irresponsible forms of medical experimentation will probably be banned by Honduran law or international law or something. If theyxe2x80x99re not, he expects that insurance companies will keep their distance. If they donxe2x80x99t, he expects theyxe2x80x99ll find a way to ban it anyway, for PR reasons if nothing else.7.4. What are property rights like?3D, possibly on the blockchain.Prxc3xb3speran property is sold in three dimension voxels, eg 1m x 1m x 1m cubes, which is supposed to solve xe2x80x9cair rightsxe2x80x9d debates once and for all. The idea is: imagine I have a house with a nice view of the beach, but my neighbor right in front of me wants to build a tower that blocks my view. Can he do it? In the US, the answer is xe2x80x9cdepends what happens after ten years of lawsuits and city council meetingsxe2x80x9d. In Prxc3xb3spera, the answer is xe2x80x9cdepends who owns the voxels the tower is going through.xe2x80x9dSo if I want to prevent my neighbor from building a tower and blocking my view, I can buy the air above his house that the tower would have to pass through; then if my neighbor builds there, hexe2x80x99s trespassing on my property. But if my neighbor wants to buy a house and make sure he has the option to expand it into a tower five years later, he can buy the air above his house along with the ground, and then nobody can tell him what to do on his own property.In practice, this is going to look more like Prxc3xb3spera selling everybody ground-level voxels, then agreeing to sell or not sell higher-up voxels depending on whether they want to xe2x80x9czonexe2x80x9d land for higher-density construction.  What happens if the person who owns the base of a skyscraper wants to raze it, but the person who owns the fifth floor doesnxe2x80x99t want it razed? Ixe2x80x99m not sure, but other jurisdictions already do something like this (New York City has a hackish partially 3D property rights system) so probably someonexe2x80x99s already thought about it.Though itxe2x80x99s just a throwaway sentence in one of their more speculative documents, they also mention:Land backed tokens: One way to capitalize and fund the purchase and development of land is through the use of a land backed crypto token. In effect, anyone in the world could buy one of the tokens issued for a specific plot of land. This capital would then be used to purchase and develop the land, with a secondary market enabling early movers to profit as the development grows and with [HPI] or some other financial partner potentially buying all the tokens back at the successful development of the lot. This would powerfully democratize land development away from the wealthy and open the space up to everyone else.7.5: Whatxe2x80x99s the government?Garrett Jones famously recommended 10% less democracy . Prxc3xb3spera goes further: 44% less democracy. The city will be governed by a Council of nine people, of whom five are elected and four appointed by HPI.(right now everyone is appointed by HPI because no one lives there, but there are various provisions for gradually giving residents more of a voice as more of them move in, and eventually five Council members will be elected)But thatxe2x80x99s still kind of democratic, right? Majority democratic? Yes, but the Council requires 66% majority to do anything. The five democratically-elected members canxe2x80x99t do anything without at least one HPI member in support.But HPI also canxe2x80x99t do anything without some democratic members in support, right? Yes, but HPI has already written all the laws the way they want them. They canxe2x80x99t change anything without at least some democratic support, but they expect to be pretty happy even if they have to keep everything the same.(also, one assumes that the four HPI members will vote as a bloc on issues important to the company, but the democratically elected members will be split among various parties and philosophies in the tradition of democratic elections everywhere. As long as 2/5 democratically elected members vote with HPI, HPI gets what it wants).Other parts of the government follow the same principle: impressively democratic on the surface, unlikely to rock the boat in practice. For example, if the general population disagree with a law passed by the Council, they can overturn it in a referendum with a simple 50% majority. But the offer only applies within seven days of the law being passed (Trey insists that Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s e-governance platform will be so good that it will be easy to know whatxe2x80x99s going on, start a referendum, and finish voting within a seven day period). Even after the seven days, the public can repeal any law. But now it requires a 66% majority, and also this process can only repeal laws, not add them.The most drastic check on the government: once Prxc3xb3spera has 100,000 residents (so realistically a long time from now, if the experiment is very successful), they can hold a referendum where 51% majority can change anything about the charter, including kicking HPI out entirely and becoming a direct democracy, or rejoining the rest of Honduras, or anything. Trey says he hopes it never gets this far, that he canxe2x80x99t imagine failing so badly that the residents would want to kick them out, and that this was added in case somehow Prxc3xb3spera gets gobbled up by some other company that does a much worse job than HPI intends to. But also, the referendum requires support from 51% of eligible voters, not 51% of the people who turn out to vote. For comparison, in the most lopsided presidential election in modern US history, FDR winning his second term with 523 electoral votes to his opponentxe2x80x99s 8, only 35% of eligible voters voted for FDR.  Other interesting Prxc3xb3spera government facts: candidates for the 5 democratically-elected seats must have \"successful business experience or comparable strong management or leadership experience\", and be of \"high ethical standards\". If you think a candidate is inexperienced or has a history of shady behavior, you can challenge their candidacy in court.  7.5.1: What about the judiciary?Honduras requires Prxc3xb3spera to use the regular Honduran criminal justice system, but they can have their own civil law. Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s civil law is based around arbitration. When signing a contract, you can choose who will arbitrate your contract in case of disagreements. If you donxe2x80x99t choose, you default to the Prxc3xb3spera Arbitration Center.I donxe2x80x99t envy the PAC if they have adjudicate disputes involving, say, a doctor who has chosen to be regulated by the medical code of Norway suing her office building regulated by the laws of Houston, Texas. But theyxe2x80x99re trying to rise to the occasion: their arbiters include a former Arizona Supreme Court judge, the head of the Cato Institutexe2x80x99s Center for Constitutional Studies, and xe2x80x9cthe first Chilean lawyer to obtain permission from the Berlin Bar Association to act as a legal advisor in Chilean law in Germanyxe2x80x9d, which I guess sounds like the level of convolutedness you would need to be experienced in to make this work.7.6. What if I move to this weird charter city thatxe2x80x99s schismed from the rest of Honduras, and I decide I donxe2x80x99t like it? Am I allowed to meta-schism from it and form my own even weirder, charter-er city?Allowed, encouraged, and your right to do so is enshrined into law!Trey writes:We wanted to allow for the creation of internal competitive pressures on ourselves. As such, by the Charter, any community can create a community interest declaration and displace the GSP entirely within the limits of their community. Itxe2x80x99s a miniature competitive jurisdiction within the [larger] Prxc3xb3spera jurisdiction. It still has to comply with Prxc3xb3spera statutes, but is free to make its own rules just like an HOA does, and is free to hire itxe2x80x99s own security like many private developments around the world do.Unlike anywhere else in the world, it also displaces the rest of the jurisdictionsxe2x80x99 provision of services in that area. So if an intrepid individual wants to create a better community with better rules and administration than we have, we invite them to come do it! Test drive your Marxist commune in Prxc3xb3spera! Maybe it will work this time. If it does, then people can move out of the rest of Prxc3xb3spera and into your little community, and the ZEDE will have to adapt its meta institutions accordingly.This mostly applies to provision of services (eg electricity, sanitation, policing). But partly thatxe2x80x99s because Prxc3xb3spera already provides optionality in other areas. For example, by default contracts disputes are resolved under Prxc3xb3speran law by the Prxc3xb3spera Arbitration Center, but you and your fellow commune-members can agree that all of your contracts will be resolved under your own private law that you made up, by some other arbiter you selected. Most of the schools will be private anyway, but if your commune wants to have its own separate private school, nobody can stop you there either.8. What stops Honduras from pulling the rug out from under them after theyxe2x80x99re successful?A timely question, given recent news about Hong Kong. Its unique position outside the Chinese system helped it grow rich and important, China promised to preserve that position, and - once it became inconvenient to China, they reneged on their promise and reapplied Chinese law. Why couldnxe2x80x99t the same happen here?The law enabling ZEDEs was passed as an amendment to the Honduran Constitution, which would require a 66% majority to overrule (it was passed with a 78% majority, so that would require an overwhelming turn against it). The law also says that even if repealed, it will take ten years for the repeal to take effect (I donxe2x80x99t know if this is legal or enforceable). Ten years is longer than a Honduran election cycle, so you would need two consecutive governments to agree to repeal it.Prxc3xb3spera says they are xe2x80x9cguaranteed by international treatyxe2x80x9d. The particular treaty involved is the Honduras-Kuwait Treaty For Reciprocal Investment (link in Spanish), in which I think Honduras tells Kuwait that they should feel comfortable investing in ZEDEs because Honduras promises not to get rid of them for 50 years. I donxe2x80x99t have anywhere near the understanding of international law I would need to know if this is actually binding. Could a future ZEDE-hostile Honduran Congress repeal this treaty? Would that damage their international reputation? Precipitate the Great Honduras-Kuwait War Of 2036?  Finally, what would Hondurasxe2x80x99 incentive be? They went into this hoping that ZEDEs would be economically productive, and this would benefit the rest of Honduras and let them skim a little off the top. If ZEDEs actually become economically productive, letting that benefit the rest of Honduras and skimming a little off the top still seems like their best bet. Sure, if push came to shove, they could take over the ZEDE by military force. But that would be killing the goose that lays golden eggs. China didnxe2x80x99t take over Hong Kong because they wanted its money. They already had as much of its money as they cared to take. They took over Hong Kong because they wanted to maintain autocratic rule, and having a successful democracy inside their borders was too awkward. The Charter Cities Institutexe2x80x99s blog talks about this further.9. Is anyone else doing anything like this?There's another ZEDE project called Ciudad Morazxc3xa1n, on the Honduran mainland. They are almost exactly the same size - 59 acres. They're less flashy and ideological and publicity-seeking than Prxc3xb3spera. They just seems to want to build a nice neighborhood in the suburbs of Choloma, Honduras. Looking at their website, they talk a lot about crime and \"freedom from fear\". I think at least part of their business case is to be able to give poorer Hondurans a place to live that has private security and good policing, which would be a big attraction in such a violence-ridden country. They promise that:xe2x80x9cCiudad Morazxc3xa1n offers freedom of fear because it is a private venture, created to make money. The developer has to provide its clients the best possible environment in order to rent the spaces of the community. The developer will not keep in its payroll corrupt or ill-mannered security guards. It will not rent accommodations to criminals. The houses are built to last and are resistant to nature events...Residents that engage in criminal activities will be swiftly turned over to police authorities. People that do not follow the rules of coexistence or are a nuisance to their fellow residents will be denied the renewal of the rent. We will be strict in the application of the rules, because it is the only way to guarantee everybody the best possible place to develop as responsible, happy and fulfilled individuals.xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99d originally thought these people were more grounded and less ideological than Prxc3xb3spera - where Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s documentation has wild dreams of 3D property rights and land-backed crypto tokens, Ciudad Morazanxe2x80x99s has page after page diagramming how the sewer system is going to work. Just normal, hard-headed businesspeople doing business, right?  But I recently spotted their CEO/Council Secretary in the Marginal Revolution comments section, a sure sign of a deranged mind.Still, they have a lot of advantages over Prxc3xb3spera. For one thing, their ambitions are lower. For another, they're run by a huge company, Centro American Consulting & Capital, with \"revenues...around $800M per year\". For another, nobody seems to have noticed them enough to get angry yet.Speaking of whichxe2x80xa610. Will Prxc3xb3spera expropriate land?Therexe2x80x99s a whole small industry of anti-Prxc3xb3spera activism, almost all of which centers around the same concerns: Prxc3xb3spera is going to steal peoplexe2x80x99s land, Prxc3xb3spera will nonconsensually annex the surrounding towns, thousands of people will be forced into Prxc3xb3spera against their will, Prxc3xb3spera will evict indigenous people from their own territory, then sell it back to them at sky-high prices.  To be completely fair to these people, this is usually a good starting assumption whenever something is happening in Honduras. Hondurasxe2x80x99 North Bay - the area where Prxc3xb3spera will be starting off - has a long and ugly history of evicting natives for big development projects.  The concerns around Prxc3xb3spera mirror the case of Randy Jorgensen, a Canadian porn mogul, who founded a chain of Honduran tourist resorts. He expropriated land from native communities, especially a group called the Garifuna who are descended from escaped African slaves. Jorgensen and his supporters in the Honduran government did use violence (and other tactics, like cutting off basic services) to force the Garifuna off the land. It was terrible, and everyone in this part of Honduras is understandably on edge. Although there's no connection between Jorgensen and the ZEDE, some people see them as the product of the same pro-business, pro-development tendency in Honduran government.Prxc3xb3spera has tried its best to repudiate these kinds of tactics. Theyxe2x80x99ve passed an internal resolution saying itxe2x80x99s illegal for Prxc3xb3spera to ever expropriate Honduran land without the ownersxe2x80x99 consent. With their support, the CAMP (the Honduran governing body regulating ZEDEs) has passed a Honduran resolution saying itxe2x80x99s illegal for ZEDEs to expropriate Honduran land. Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s current territory is a completely empty site where xe2x80x9cin order to avoid claims of expropriation (which we somehow inexplicably got tarred with anyways), we [did] title research to ensure at no point in the property title's entire history has it ever been expropriated by the government.xe2x80x9d Their stated policy is to only buy other empty land, from the landowner, with their consent.The flashpoint of this conflict has been a fishing village a few hundred feet from the Prxc3xb3spera site called Crawfish Rock (its name is in English because Roatan was formerly a British colony and still has many English speakers). Different versions of the story are going around - according to Prxc3xb3spera, Crawfish Rock held a referendum on whether they wanted Prxc3xb3spera next door, and 90%+ voted yes. According to opponents, those people didn't realize Prxc3xb3spera was a ZEDE and probably hate ZEDEs and would all be against Prxc3xb3spera if they understood it. This site has some more incomprehensible and contradictory information, including that On August 10, the federation of village councils and several civic  associations in Roatan released a joint statement about the unrest  caused by the project, given that it went into motion without adequate community awareness or consultation [xe2x80xa6] The model city developersxe2x80xa6sent a letter on August 20 to the  residents of Crawfish Rock indicating that the village council had [since] disassociated itself from the public statement and supported the Prxc3xb3spera project. But no village council members signed this document.   There was a weird event which I don't have a great perspective on, where Erick Brimen, CEO of HPI, scheduled a meeting in Crawfish Rock to explain what Prxc3xb3spera was and why people didn't need to be afraid of it. The municipal government banned him from having the meeting, supposedly because of COVID. Brimen felt he was being silenced, and said that he would have the meeting outdoors and observe all social distancing guidelines but otherwise wasn't going to back off. He held the meeting, the municipal government sent police to shut it down, and after some resistance it got shut down (see video below).  Do the Prxc3xb3sperans seem a little defensive about this? I think itxe2x80x99s warranted. The government of actual Honduras has been expropriating things right and left throughout this area for decades. This is part of the failure of Honduran governance that theyxe2x80x99re trying to provide an alternative to. Instead of having to live in a country that expropriates your land whenever Canadian porn moguls ask them to, you could live in a libertarian paradise obsessed with property rights and rule of law. Trey says: \"Land expropriation is the exact kind of governance failure Prxc3xb3spera exists to fix\".  But everyone keeps ignoring Hondurasxe2x80x99 repeated and flagrant land expropriation in favor of freaking out over completely fictional land expropriation by Prxc3xb3spera.10.1. Could Prxc3xb3spera commit human rights abuses?Well, they say they wonxe2x80x99t.  But they at least make a strong case. Their first argument is that the border with Honduras is about five hundred feet away. Most Prxc3xb3sperans will be Honduran citizens (and the few expats can probably take care of themselves). So if anyone is unhappy or feels like their rights are being violated, one of their options will be to walk five hundred feet and be back home in regular Honduras. It would be really hard for Prxc3xb3spera to give immigrants from elsewhere in Hondurans a life worse than normal Honduras is offering them, and still keep them in the ZEDE.Their second argument builds on the first; HPI only makes money if lots of people live in Prxc3xb3spera and patronize it with their business. If they start murdering people or stealing things, you wouldnxe2x80x99t want to live there and you wouldnxe2x80x99t want to set up a business there. When Hondurasxe2x80x99 neighbor Nicaragua brutally crushed anti-government protests, their GDP per capita decreased 10% - an unprecedented amount during peacetime - as citizens fled, businesses closed, and foreign investment rushed out. If nothing else, HPI will be trying to avoid this to protect its own bottom line.Their third argument is that Honduras is a party to all the normal international human rights treaties, and those treaties still apply in ZEDEs like Prxc3xb3spera. So human rights violations remain illegal. ZEDE law says that any alleged human rights violations in Prxc3xb3spera go straight to international courts (though nobody has figured out exactly which international court yet). For lesser issues, Honduras is also working on a system of ZEDE courts, where people who feel ill-treated in a ZEDE can appeal to Honduras-government-run ZEDE court and have their case heard.And also: I'm writing this post off of some internal documents I was allowed to see, but I'm summarizing them. The real documents are this same information, but constantly interrupted by a bunch of brightly-colored graphics about how sustainable and just everything will be all the time. Words like \"equitable\" get used like they are going out of style. They plan to have \"no poverty\", \"zero hunger\", \"gender equality\", \"reduced inequalities\", \"climate action\", etc. Therexe2x80x99s a whole formal Bill Of Rights which they say \"provides stronger human rights protections than those of the UNxe2x80x99s Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" and \"is more restrictive of state power and coercion than the American Bill of Rights, with clearer and more objective language\". Just assume that whatever concerns you have, they have a brightly colored graphic that uses meticulously-crafted language to express their commitment not to do it. These documents were aimed at investors.  So if you've read enough Matt Levine, you know where I'm going with this: if anything bad ever happens in Prxc3xb3spera, you can probably sue them for securities fraud.10.2. Whatxe2x80x99s the case against Prxc3xb3spera?You can read what actual anti-Prxc3xb3spera people have to say here, here, and of course on Vice. But I canxe2x80x99t stress enough how misleading and awful most of it is.xe2x80x9cImaginexe2x80xa6xe2x80x9d starts the first:  xe2x80xa6you live in the most dangerous country in the world that is not in a war zone. You fear your government, and the ZEDE syndicate taking over your homeland as much as you fear the narcotics gangsxe2x80xa6these libertarian neocolonial conquistadorsxe2x80x99 sole aim is to eventually force all of you out of their stolen paradise, and eventually expand, swallow and exploit the most precious parts of your country and its resourcesxe2x80xa6.In this new ZEDE experiment the indigenous people on Roatan how have to re-apply and pay to live on the their own land.  Nobody is as afraid of ZEDEs as they are of narco-gangs. Nobody is being forced out of anywhere - theyxe2x80x99re being offered the choice to move to a previously unoccupied area. Nobody has to pay to live on their own land - they have to pay to live on someone elsexe2x80x99s land if they voluntarily move to it.xe2x80x9cNightmare libertarian project turns Honduras into the murder capital of the world!xe2x80x9d says Salon (Hondurasxe2x80x99 murder rate has been consistently terrible, started its most recent increase in 2006, started going down in 2011, and is now around the same as it was in 1990; the libertarians control an area of land smaller than a golf course in a country of ten million people). New Republic quoting a Honduran journalist: xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99ve seen all sorts of horrific things in my time, but none as detrimental to the country as this.xe2x80x9d (Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras in 1998, killing 7,000 people and leaving 1.5 million homeless; Prxc3xb3spera plans to build a nice city on unoccupied land and let people live in it if they want). Meanwhile, every week the regular government of Honduras does worse things than anyone in a ZEDE has ever done to anybody, and nobody cares because theyxe2x80x99re not libertarians so it doesnxe2x80x99t count.Other people are playing up the ultra-nationalist side of things. The territorial integrity of Honduras is the most important thing possible! It would be better for everyone to die than to see even one inch of Honduras get governed by institutions that foreigners had a hand in designing! I have never understood why Japanese people will give their lives to keep some uninhabited ocean rocks from the clutches of China, or vice versa, but there seem to be a lot of Hondurans equally concerned about a 58-acre parcel of uninhabited land on Roatan. The new ZEDE law, which emphasizes that the territories remain within some of Honduras' institutions, seem to have partly (but not completely) cooled some of these sentiments.  10.2.1. Can you steel-man the case against Prxc3xb3spera?There are a few other arguments that I find more concerning.First, although Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s unlikely to expropriate land, nothing prevents them from buying land from its rightful owners. If those rightful owners are landlords, then their tenants could unexpectedly end up in Prxc3xb3spera. Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s only allowed to do this in low-density areas, but much of Roatan is officially classified as low-density. Although Prxc3xb3spera intends to mostly buy unoccupied land, they wonxe2x80x99t rule out a situation where eg they buy a mostly-unoccupied area with a groundskeeper who lives in a rented groundskeeperxe2x80x99s hut somewhere on the property, and then that groundskeeper might find themselves in Prxc3xb3spera unexpectedly.  This is - maybe not a giant human rights violation? Landlords can already kick tenants out of their land. And getting unexpectedly added to Prxc3xb3spera seems strictly less bad than getting kicked out, since the worst case scenario is you can always choose to leave. Also, if everything goes according to plan this should happen very rarely, maybe one or two groundskeepers per giant city. But accepting for the sake of argument that anything bad is much worse when libertarians do it, this is one of the possible bad things.Second, people on the edges of Prxc3xb3spera will probably experience a lot of gentrification. I trust Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s commitment not to annex Crawfish Rock. But they do plan to build a giant very rich city surrounding Crawfish Rock on all sides, and it would be surprising if that had no effect on Crawfish Rock itself. This is no different than what everyone on the outskirts of every city in the world has had to experience as those cities grow, but itxe2x80x99s another possible bad thing. At least if youxe2x80x99re a renter there. If you own property there, I guess youxe2x80x99re now super-rich.Third, could Prxc3xb3spera become a tax haven? Rather, given that they have a tax rate of 10% in a country with a tax rate of about 25%, why wouldnxe2x80x99t it become a tax haven? I asked Trey, who said that Honduras is awful at collecting taxes, and rich Honduran tax evaders already have plenty of options without having to move to a charter city. Honduras has a 25% tax rate but doesnxe2x80x99t collect; Prxc3xb3spera plans to have a 10% tax rate and collect every cent.Fourth, is Honduras really getting its money worth? Prxc3xb3spera has 10% taxes, and Honduras gets 12% of that. So they get 1% of economic activity in the ZEDE. But Prxc3xb3spera wonxe2x80x99t have its own military, criminal justice system, prison system, etc - it will be parasitic on Honduras for a lot of this. Presumably the central government hopes that 1% of economic activity will pay for all this and then some. If theyxe2x80x99re wrong, a lot of people are going to be really mad.Ixe2x80x99m pretty surprised Honduras didnxe2x80x99t hold out for a better deal. I donxe2x80x99t think this is Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s fault. Prxc3xb3spera didnxe2x80x99t exist when the original ZEDE negotiations were going on. But they have a monopoly - no one else is offering a ZEDE-like product - and youxe2x80x99d think they could have gotten a better price from it.10.3 And whatxe2x80x99s the case for?Thousands of Hondurans make the dangerous journey to the United States in search of freedom, safety, and a living wage. They're tired of poverty and murder and corruption and think that a well-run polity with capitalist institutions can help them build a better life. I canxe2x80x99t blame them one whit. America is a better place to live than Honduras. This isn't because Americans are smarter, or harder-working, or morally superior. It's because Honduras has bad institutions.  But these people will probably or get turned away at the border, or languish in ICE detention camps, or die en route. Right now, wexe2x80x99re failing these people, not to mention the thousands more who wish they could make the same journey but are too scared to try. Prxc3xb3spera wants to give these people a better option by bringing American-style institutions to Honduras. They're not going to displace any existing residents or include anyone who doesn't want to be included. They just want to give people who have been ill-served by statism and nationalism a choice other than traveling three thousand miles and scrambling over barbed wire fences.  If you were a completely ordinary Honduran, making $1,300 a year, having a medium lifetime risk of being murdered, with the government occasionally taking your land and killing you if you complained - would you want the option of moving to Prxc3xb3spera? With its civil rights, property rights, strong security, good education, and higher salaries? I have these things right now in America and they're great. I can't imagine wanting these privileges for myself and also working to deny them to others. The people who like statism, ultra-nationalism, and the status quo have an entire world to play around in, and it's turned out...well, you can see how it's turned out. The Prxc3xb3sperans want 58 acres to try something different.Also, remember status quo bias. If Prxc3xb3spera already existed, and somebody asked to take some of their land and create Honduras, would that be ethical? Absent a great answer to that question, it's hard for me to worry about the reverse.10.3.1. So the case is that itxe2x80x99ll be good for Hondurans?Thatxe2x80x99s the medium-good-case scenario. In the best-case scenario, it could also be good for everyone else.When China created the Shenzhen special economic zone, its success didnxe2x80x99t just enrich Shenzhen. It became the evidence that Chinese liberals used to enact reforms across the whole country, and Chinese GDP per capita dectupled over the next thirty years. And Vietnam saw Chinaxe2x80x99s success and liberalized its own markets, and GDP there sextupled. And then Laos saw Vietnamxe2x80x99s success and liberalized its markets, and GDP there tripled. And before you know it, a billion and a half people were lifted out of poverty.Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s white paper mentions xe2x80x9cexpansion opportunitiesxe2x80x9d in Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Haiti. None of those countries allow ZEDEs now, and none of them seem interested in changing that. But if they watch Honduras get rich, maybe theyxe2x80x99ll think again. There are six hundred million people in Latin America; who knows where they could be thirty years from now?And maybe even the gringos can learn something. To my biased eye, Prxc3xb3speraxe2x80x99s institutions arenxe2x80x99t just better than Honduran institutions. They might well be better than the institutions of America, Europe, and the rest of the developed world. Some of their ideas - 3D property rights, modular construction, common law regulatory options, medical reciprocity laws - are genuinely innovative, the first in the world. Theyxe2x80x99re things that intellectuals have been discussing for decades, and then suddenly some progressive-minded people get a jurisdiction to try them out in and see if they work. I wonxe2x80x99t call this historically unprecedented - for example, it happened in 1776 - but itxe2x80x99s a rare opportunity.Never underestimate embarrassment as a driver of progress. When the US was dragging its feet on COVID vaccines, Israel vaccinated its population quickly and safely, and that embarrassed us enough to get the ball rolling. Or: the US is terrible at building infrastructure. Wexe2x80x99re starting to discuss ways to fix this, but we wouldnxe2x80x99t have realized anything was wrong without stories about China constructing high-speed rail at lightning speed, or memories of our grandparents building Hoover Dam and the interstate highways.  If Prxc3xb3spera gets - I donxe2x80x99t know, letxe2x80x99s say a network of cheap VTOL air taxi drones - maybe wexe2x80x99ll find we can still feel shame. Maybe itxe2x80x99ll be embarrassing to have Honduras beat us to the future. Maybe wexe2x80x99ll start wondering if we can learn something.10.4. Whatxe2x80x99s the case for being neither outraged or inspired but just kind of bored?I can't stress enough that right now, Prxc3xb3spera is 58 acres (the size of an average housing development), with three buildings on it, next to a golf course. It has big potential. But right now, it's that.Also, its potential is - maybe not as big as it could be? If all of Prxc3xb3spera's Roatan land deals go through, it can grow to about a thousand acres. That's 1.5 square miles. That's 10% the size of Dubai, 5% the size of Manhattan, and less than 1% the size of Singapore. Even if it gets the same population density as Manhattan, that only means about 100,000 people. And it probably won't get the same population density as Manhattan. Manhattan has sixteen skyscrapers over a thousand feet tall. The tallest building on any of the renders of Prxc3xb3spera I saw had eight stories. Realistically the Roatan site will be a medium-sized town. This isn't to say they can't build more hubs on the mainland, or even elsewhere on Roatan. But even a cool VTOL drone network isn't going to change the way agglomeration effects work - their original site has limited ability to grow into a major city.Also, Honduras is very poor and has many people who need help. But that poverty and those people mostly aren't on Roatan. Roatan is a tropical vacation paradise, full of beautiful five-star resorts, five-star restaurants, and five-star tourist traps.  This isn't to say there are no poor people on Roatan. There are. But those poor people mostly aren't poor because they lack access to the amenities of modern civilization. They're poor because the giant golf resort next door doesn't pay much for their particular skills, or because they canxe2x80x99t / don't want to work for a golf resort. Adding more development to Roatan has limited ability to fix those problems, and Prxc3xb3spera isn't going to be playing on hard mode until they start expanding to the rest of the country.10.5. Whatxe2x80x99s your opinion?Itxe2x80x99s hard for me to get too freaked out about corporate model cities - I grew up in one. The Irvine family of California ranchers founded the Irvine Company to develop their land, and in the 1970s they partnered with the UC system and local real estate developers to build a new city. The result - Irvine, California - is constantly showing up in various Best City lists - #5 best public schools in America, #1 fiscally strongest city, #10 best place to raise a family, #8 healthiest, #3 greenest, #1 safest, etc, etc, etc. Also, Irvine Company head honcho Donald Bren made $17 billion and is now the 32nd richest man in America. I may not have extracted quite as much value from the experiment as Mr. Bren did, but I got a very good childhood out of it and I feel suitably grateful.So while I understand that other people might find it shocking or crazy for a corporation to buy up some land, sketch a street plan, and try to make billions of dollars by creating as nice a city as possible, well - to me it kind of reminds me of home. I promise itxe2x80x99s not that weird when youxe2x80x99re living in it.Prxc3xb3spera is a lot more ambitious than Irvine - not just planned streets and utility grids, but planned government and law code. It doesnxe2x80x99t just want to be the #X Nicest City, it wants to declare war on global poverty and win. Maybe the extra ambition will ruin the magic formula and it wonxe2x80x99t work out. I have no idea. But you miss a hundred percent of the moonshots you donxe2x80x99t take. I like the way Prxc3xb3spera thinks, and I look forward to seeing what happens.11.

I am posting this mostly as a link to people who know more.]This is a link to / ad for a great recent Less Wrong post by lsusr, Predictive Coding Has Been Unified With Backpropagation, itself about a recent paper Predictive Coding Approximates Backprop Along Arbitrary Computation Graphs.Predictive coding is the most plausible current theory of how the brain works. Ixe2x80x99ve written about it elsewhere, especially here.Backpropagation is an algorithm involved in most modern machine learning / AI. If you create a neural net and xe2x80x9ctrain itxe2x80x9d by feeding it problems and answers, the backpropagation algorithm tells you how to make the answers xe2x80x9cflow backwardxe2x80x9d through the model to produce the set of weights that would have made the model predict them. Hopefully this makes the model generally good at solving that class of problem, and then you can feed it new problems you want it to solve.Wexe2x80x99re pretty sure the brain doesnxe2x80x99t directly use backpropagation. Real backpropagation requires, well, propagation going backwards. But neurons can only send information one way; Neuron A sends to Neuron B, but not vice versa. On the other hand, the brain seems to do a lot of the same things artificial neural networks do, with a suspiciously similar structure. So researchers have long suspected the brain was doing some kind of approximation of backpropagation that ended up in the same place.A series of recent papers helps flesh this out. Predictive coding can approximate backpropagation without needing backwards information transfer. The most recent paper shows that you can do this for arbitrary computational graphs. lsusr writes:There are two big implications of this.This paper permanently fuses artificial intelligence and neuroscience into a single mathematical field.This paper opens up possibilities for neuromorphic computing hardware.Ixe2x80x99m not sure I am as excited as they are; AI and neuroscience have always been a single field in some spiritual sense, and they continue to be very different fields in practice. And Ixe2x80x99m not sure what good more neuromorphic computers would be - lsusr suggests xe2x80x9ca computer that doesnxe2x80x99t break when you cut it in halfxe2x80x9d, but it sounds easier to just avoid letting your computer end up in a situation where that might matter.But therexe2x80x99s been a debate over how much existing neural nets are already pretty similar to the brain, vs. the brain is doing fundamentally more advanced things that we donxe2x80x99t understand at all. This line of research provides some evidence that artificial and natural intelligence are already more similar than we thought.The paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04182.pdfThe article: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JZZENevaLzLLeC3zn/predictive-coding-has-been-unified-with-backpropagationFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"[LINK] Unifying Predictive Coding With Backpropagation - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/link-unifying-predictive-coding-with"}

The paper is especially interesting for using a xe2x80x9cmultiverse analysisxe2x80x9d: We evaluated 848 models, including logistic regression as per the original paper, plus linear regression and twoforms of propensity score analysis. Only 166 models (19.6%) yielded a statistically significant relationship between early TV exposure and later attention problems, with most of these employing problematic analytic choices.If I had the energy to look through 848 models and see which ones got significant findings and which ones didnxe2x80x99t, I bet I would become enlightened by the end of it.2: Seen on architecture Twitter:March 12th 20213: Ixe2x80x99ve complained before about how everyone uses the same example - Brasilia - when they talk about how central planning can go bad. As a public service, I offer these people this article about a similar problem in South Koreaxe2x80x99s planned city of Songdo.4: Fantastic Anachronism on machine-intelligence-based vs. human-intelligence-based paths to the future.

Turns out the Internet is kind of terrible!6: Claim: Baltimore suspended prosecutions of minor crimes to prevent people from being in jail during the pandemic, and major crimes dropped (even though they rose in many other cities over the same period). Now theyxe2x80x99re experimenting with ignoring minor crimes indefinitely. See also the recent Agan, Doleac, and Harvey paper (or, even better, the Marginal Revolution post on it) exploiting random variation in misdemeanour prosecution to show that people prosecuted for misdemeanours are more likely to commit further criminal behavior in the future, as well as showing an effect in Boston similar to the one in Baltimore. Seems kind of like the opposite of (a certain interpretation of) broken window policing, so ought to be interesting to watch this debate develop.7: Very large long-term study: working memory training definitely does not increase IQ. Sorry, people who spent years playing dual-n-back games.8: A Canadian techie writes about why the Canadian tech scene doesnxe2x80x99t work. Read it even if (like me and most people) you donxe2x80x99t care about the Canadian tech scene - it gives unusual clarity about what a business ecosystem is and why one areaxe2x80x99s might be better or worse than another. Weirdly reminiscent of development economics.9: Seen on Tumblr, I cannot confirm or deny:10: Noahpinion presents the case against global poverty decrease denialism. Also good on Noahpinion: China is very 20th century. China is at the techno-economic level that the West was in the mid-20th-century so maybe we should be less surprised that itxe2x80x99s growing at the rate the West did in the mid-20th-century, or has the same struggles with authoritarianism and genocide the West faced in the mid-20th-century. 11: Map of Reddit, one of the better such efforts. You can find r/slatestarcodex on the northern continent, in the land of Beliefs, about midway between r/DSA and r/SamHarris .

Answer: probably not. Although testosterone levels declined in the mid-20th century, they stabilized a few decades ago, and the steepest dropoffs in fertility have been more recent.16: Before Europeans applied the word xe2x80x9cpantherxe2x80x9d to the big cat found in Asia / the Americas, it was a mythical animal akin to the chimera or pegasus (its name comes from pan+therion, xe2x80x9call animalsxe2x80x9d, and it was probably originally one of those xe2x80x9chead of an X, body of a Y, tail of a Zxe2x80x9d deals).

Probably the best of the most recent million or so anti-journalist essays, but most relevant to me was the discussion of the recent trend of journalists xe2x80x9cexposingxe2x80x9d private citizens:CNN confronted  an old woman on the front lawn of her Florida home for the crime of  having used her little Facebook page to promote a pro-Trump event they  claimed was engineered by Russians. The same network threatened to expose the identity of another private citizen who created an anti-CNN meme unless he begged and promised not to do it again. HuffPost doxed the real-life name of an anonymous critic of Islam (whose spouted views I find repellent) and triggered a boycott of her familyxe2x80x99s business.  Just last week, The Daily Beast decided to expose the identity  of a private citizen at Spring Break in Miami and detail his marital  and legal problems because a video of him went viral due to his being  dressed as the Joker and uttering xe2x80x9cCOVID trutherxe2x80x9d phrases. The same outlet congratulated itself  for unearthing and exposing the real name of an African-American Facebook user whose crime was posting videos mocking Nancy Pelosi.

He briefly became a national hero, until Harvey Milk tipped off the media that he was part of SFxe2x80x99s gay community (Milk was hoping to prove that gay people could be heroes too, but Sipple didnxe2x80x99t want to be outed and Milk comes off really badly here). Sipple begged the media not to publish, but the papers decided he was a public figure and so fair game. His family disowned him, his health declined, and he ended up drinking himself to death.19: DeepNostalgia is a technology for xe2x80x9canimating your family photosxe2x80x9d (though critics note it just makes plausible guesses and doesnxe2x80x99t necessarily look like the real person).

It wasnxe2x80x99t and he died. If youxe2x80x99ve ever wanted to know how much LSD it would take to kill an elephant, the answer is: somewhere less than 300 mg.22: Best of recent r/slatestarcodex: Prose Is Bad23: Pew feature on political mutual understanding - just 2% of Biden/Trump voters feel like Trump/Biden voters understand their point of view xe2x80x9cvery wellxe2x80x9d.

I talked to Saar Wilf of Rootclaim, who was very helpful and responsive, and we had a good discussion about the evidence in favor and against. The result: Saar convinced me to shift from a 75% probability that Vitamin D doesnxe2x80x99t work to more like a 66-70% probability; I convinced Saar to back off from his previous betting terms that scientists would soon acknowledge Vitamin D worked better than steroids or remesdevir (not because he thought Vitamin D didnxe2x80x99t work, just because science isnxe2x80x99t self-correcting enough to change its mind that quickly or conclusively, which I agree with). We tried to come up with some other agreeable set of terms, but werenxe2x80x99t able to make something work given my relatively high level of loss aversion. Overall I came out of the discussion with a high level of respect for Saar, and Ixe2x80x99d like to investigate Rootclaim further at some point.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Open Thread 167 - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-167"}

Luckily, as long as she has a  job, she will have health insurance. And health insurance provides her  with a treatment. Every day she takes the treatment, her health will go  up one point on a 0-100 scale; every day she misses the treatment, it  will go down one point. If her health ever gets below 75, she will be  too ill to work.Mathematicians would call this a dynamical system with three variables: does she have a job or not, does she have insurance or not, and her health  level. We know from the rules above that j always equals i, and that j  is 1 as long has h is 75 or higher. And every day i = 1, h goes up one;  every day i = 0, h goes down 1.Alice starts with a job and health of 100. Since j = 1 and i = 1,  health goes up one each day, but itxe2x80x99s maxed out at 100 so it just says  there. This state is perfectly stable; as long as the system follows the  rules above, it will never change.Suppose Alice gets a mild cold which knocks her health down to 90.  She keeps working, her health keeps going up 1 each day, and she  eventually gets back to 100.Suppose Alice gets a medium flu which knocks her health down to 80.  She keeps working, her health keeps going up 1 each day, and she  eventually gets back to 100.But suppose Alice gets a serious pneumonia which knocks her health  down to 70. Now she canxe2x80x99t work, she loses insurance, her health starts  going down 1 each day, and she eventually goes down to 0. This is  another stable state; as long as the system keeps evolving according to  the rules, it will never change.Letxe2x80x99s be more specific: the mathematicians would call this a dynamical system with three variables and two attractor states.  An attractor state is a stable situation that tends to xe2x80x9csuckxe2x80x9d nearby  unstable situations into it. Alice having a job, insurance, and health  70 is an unstable situation; she will immediately get fired, lose her  insurance, and have her health start going down, until she reaches the  stable (j = 0, i = 0, h = 0) attractor. Likewise, Alice having no job,  no insurance, and health 90 is an unstable situation; she will get  hired, get insurance, and have her health start going up until she  reaches (j = 1, i = 1, h = 100). These are the only two stable  attractors; any other situation will eventually turn into one of those  two.We can visualize this as a terrain with hills and basins:If the ball is anywhere other than at the bottom of the basins, it  will roll into the nearest basin, then stay there until acted upon by an  outside force. There are two possible basins of stability xe2x80x93 Alice  having a job, insurance, and being healthy, and Alice having no job, no  insurance, and being sick. If something else is true, she will drift to  whichever of these two equilibria is closer.This is an interesting twist to the recent discussion about  taxometrics; it introduces change over time. Two of the variables in our  system (job and health insurance) are categorical. One (health) is  dimensional xe2x80x93 it can be anywhere from zero to 100. The system itself is  supposedly dimensional  (there are lots of places it could be) xe2x80x93 but in  reality will mostly be categorical (it will tend to one of two very  different attractor states). Even health, a supposedly dimensional  variable, will tend towards either 0 or 100, making it look categorical.Anyone measuring Alicexe2x80x99s health will occasionally find that itxe2x80x99s in  places other than 0 or 100; these are not logically impossible. But a  closer analysis will find that those two values are privileged and need  further investigation.II.Bob gets sad sometimes. When hexe2x80x99s sad, he stays in his room and  refuses to talk to his friends. When he stays in his room and doesnxe2x80x99t  talk to his friends, that makes him feel sadder.You can already tell this is going nowhere good. Think of this system as having two attractor states xe2x80x93 Bob being happy and active, or Bob  being sad and inactive. Each attractor state is stable until acted upon  by an outside force. So happy active Bob will stay happy and active until  (for example) he has a bad breakup with his girlfriend, after which he  gets pushed into the (sad, inactive) state and stays there until  something else changes.According to the DSM, depression has eight core symptoms: low mood,  lack of interest in activities, appetite change, slow movements,  tiredness, feelings of worthlessness, poor concentration, and  suicidality. You could imagine a dynamical system among all these  variables, with each doing complicated things to the others, until they  settled into some kind of attractor or other.And by xe2x80x9cyou could imaginexe2x80x9d I mean xe2x80x9cBorsboom et al have mapped thisxe2x80x9d:(source)Every person has different connections between their depressive  symptoms. Being sad might make Bob stay in his room, but it might make  you go out and look for something to cheer you up. Still, we can notice some trends; people who are prone to depression seem to have much thicker connections than people who arenxe2x80x99t.Therexe2x80x99s another interesting Borsboom et al discovery. Letxe2x80x99s go back to our pictures of hills and balls.Put the ball anywhere on the terrain, and it will slide back into the  nearest attractor basin. But at different places, it will roll at  different rates. On a steep slope, it will roll very quickly; on  near-level ground, it will roll more slowly to start with. This is the  phenomenon of critical slowing-down, observed in dynamical systems as diverse as predatory largemouth bass populations and the global economy. Borsboom et al find it also applies to depression: when someone is right at the threshold for being depressed, their mood is unusually stable for a short period before finally collapsing into depression or normalcy. (also, some dynamical systems oscillate wildly between very low and  very high points, which is pretty suggestive of bipolar disorder)People often ask: is depression the just same thing as normal  sadness? Taxometrics seems to lean towards yes xe2x80x93 it cannot find a categorical  difference between major depressive disorder and normal low mood. But  Ixe2x80x99m not entirely satisfied with that answer, and dynamical systems  theory offers a reason the answer might be no: depression is an  attractor state in a dynamical system including normal sadness and many other variables. Normal sadness goes away after a few days or weeks;  depression doesnxe2x80x99t.So have Borsboom et al solved depression? I donxe2x80x99t think so. We know inflammation plays a major role in depression,  so any dynamical systems perspective that doesnxe2x80x99t include a little circle for inflammation is going to be missing a lot of the picture. But  the same is true of circadian rhythm, thyroid status, folate levels,  and trauma history. Can you ever graph all of this effectively? Wouldnxe2x80x99t  the graph start becoming so big and so complex that we stopped being  able to conceive of it as a system at all?III.Imagine some benevolent aliens surveilling Earth from orbit. They  donxe2x80x99t understand our languages, and their own culture is so exotic that  even basic ideas like xe2x80x9cmoneyxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cwarxe2x80x9d are hard for them to  understand. Still, they have good telescopes, and theyxe2x80x99re able to  measure things like how much light our cities have,  how much traffic is on our roads and sea-lanes, and how much smoke our  industries emit.After a while, they notice all these things are correlated. There are  some years (for example late 1929 and the early 1930s) when city lighting, smoke emissions, and traffic all stagnate. In other years (like the late 1990s), all these things grow even faster than usual.  After analyzing word frequency in human communications, they hypothesize  that the former type of period corresponds to English xe2x80x9crecessionxe2x80x9d and the latter period to xe2x80x9cboomxe2x80x9d. By performing sentiment analysis of human faces in the media during these periods, they hypothesize that we dislike recessions.These are benevolent aliens, and they want us to be happy, so they wonder how to prevent recessions. Sometime during the 1970s, they notice that during a recession, there are fewer oil tankers leaving the Middle East, and longer lines at First World gas stations. They know enough chemistry to realize that oil is a pretty useful fuel at our stage of  technological development, so they deduce that the recession  is caused by an oil shortage. This seems solveable! Using their  Materialization Ray, they cause one billion barrels of crude oil to  appear on the White House lawn.This actually helps a lot! Light, traffic, and industrial emissions  all return to normal. Sentiment analysis of human faces reveal a brief  period of extreme confusion, followed by happiness. The aliens have  successfully solved the recession.In 2020, they notice another profound decrease in lighting, traffic,  and factory smoke; looks like another recession. The aliens, still  wanting to help and now confident they know how, materialize another billion barrels of crude oil on the White House lawn. The Earthlings continue sheltering in place from the coronavirus, but now they also  have to deal with a billion random barrels of oil tumbling around Washington DC. The aliens have solved nothing.These aliens are friends with the aliens simulating the universe, so  they get a bunch of copies of Earth and run a bunch of experiments,  until they feel like they really understand whatxe2x80x99s going on. They present their results at the annual meeting of the Alien Planetwatchers Association (APA), and propose some general principles:1. Recessions are fractally complicated. Not only do they have  different causes, but the causes have different causes, and so on to  infinity. For example, one recession might be caused by an oil shortage  and another by coronavirus. But even oil shortage recessions are heterogenous. Some might be caused by production problems in  oil-exporting countries. Others might be caused by political strife; the Arab countries place sanctions on the First World or vice versa. Still others might be caused by a shortage of supertankers to transport the oil. Still others might be caused by refinery failures that prevent crude oil from being turned into gasoline. Still others might be caused  by trucking capacity shortages that prevent refineries from shipping  gasoline to gas stations. Even thatxe2x80x99s not enough layers; there are  dozens of possible reasons for trucking capacity shortages, from bad  weather, to labor disputes, to civic unrest, to a meteor hitting Detroit.2. All of the possible causes of recessions interact with each other.  If therexe2x80x99s a labor dispute at the trucking companies, that means gasoline sits undistributed at the refineries. But also, it means First World nations stop buying oil from producers, which could crash the  producersxe2x80x99 economies, which could mean there isnxe2x80x99t enough crude even when the trucking starts up again. But also, the refinery workers might  strike in sympathy with the truckers. But also, we donxe2x80x99t need as much  oil, because truckers arenxe2x80x99t consuming it. But also, we canxe2x80x99t run the  supertankers anymore because we donxe2x80x99t have enough oil to power them.3. The way people react to a given problem is hard to distinguish  from the problem itself, and the overall fractally-complicated mess of  causes and effects depends equally on both of them. For example, the aliens might start out believing gas lines cause oil shortages, since  they always see them at the same time. Later, they might do a  time-series analysis and determine that gas lines are a consequence of oil shortages. But even this wouldnxe2x80x99t be quite accurate xe2x80x93 gas lines are a  consequence of governments rationing gas in order to alleviate oil  shortages! If a laissez-faire government decides itxe2x80x99s not their  responsibility to ration gas, you could have an oil shortage with no gas  lines!4. Itxe2x80x99s very hard to determine the input or output of any given part  of the system, because everything tends toward homeostasis in hidden  ways. So for example, if a new and deadly coronavirus appears, it could spread and kill millions. But maybe nobody dies, because governments institute strict lockdowns. If strict lockdowns prevent  people from working, that should make them miss rent and get  evicted. But maybe nobody gets evicted, because the government increases taxes on the rich and gives the money to at-risk tenants. So death rates stay the same, but wealth inequality goes down. An alien scientist studying this system from orbit and noticing only a decrease in wealth inequality would have no way of concluding that a new and deadly disease was spreading. Everything has gone through too many steps to be legible.5. If you zoom out, you can notice very broad patterns, but these  patterns are protean and never share exactly the same features. For  example, usually recessions have low inflation xe2x80x93 but the 1970s recession  had high inflation instead. Usually recessions see capital and labor suffer alike xe2x80x93 but the 2020 recession saw very high unemployment with only brief disruptions to the stock market. So you can have a rule of thumb like xe2x80x9crecessions cause unemployment, inflation, and lower stock pricesxe2x80x9d,  but you should expect it to frequently be violated in ways you canxe2x80x99t  predict. Presumably if you knew enough about the cause of a recession  and the other things going on at the time (including what interventions  humans were using to fight the recession) you could predict this kind of  thing better. But even humans canxe2x80x99t do that, let alone aliens watching from above.6. Interventions that help one recession will fail to help superficially similar recessions. Materializing 1 billion barrels of  crude oil on the White House lawn will help an oil shortage recession but not a coronavirus recession. In fact, it wonxe2x80x99t even help every oil  shortage recession; an oil shortage recession caused by a strike at  refineries will resist treatment with crude oil. Even if you choose the exact right treatment, it might fail because of other variables you  didnxe2x80x99t consider. Materializing crude oil to treat a crude oil shortage  will fail if the government is too corrupt to distribute it effectively.  Or maybe the government tried to respond to the oil shortage by going  green, and now everything is in the middle of a difficult transition to  renewable energy, and so even though an oil shortage caused the recession, the economy can no longer benefit from increased oil.7. Most interventions have unpredictable side effects. For example,  materializing thousands of hyperrefineries run by robots successfully solves recessions caused by shortage of refinery capacity. But it also puts tens of thousands of people out of work, and sometimes those people  vote the socialist party into power, and sometimes that causes a  recession even deeper than the original one they were trying to solve.8. Almost any intervention can help or hurt a little, or sometimes both at once, often in completely unpredictable ways. For example, the  time the aliens created one million lions in the center of Times Square  was more of a test of the Materialization Ray than something they really expected to help, but this destroyed the city of New York, which hurt Americaxe2x80x99s bargaining position, which caused them to cave in to the  demands of Arab countries, which convinced the Arab countries to resume sending oil a little sooner. The APA Meeting mostly appreciates these findings, but some lively discussion ensues on a few more controversial points:Professor Zxyxon argues that their seemingly-successful treatments will have unexpected side effects. The more oil they materialize, the  more likely Earthxe2x80x99s native oil industry collapses xe2x80x93 nobody will be willing to pay for oil produced the usual way when magic oil keeps  materializing from thin air. That means that as soon as the aliens stop materializing oil, Earth will go into withdrawal, finding itself with  much less oil than ever before, and suffering a catastrophic economic collapse. She suggests that either they avoid ever materializing oil at  all, or that they xe2x80x9ctaperxe2x80x9d their oil shipments to give Earthxe2x80x99s economy a  chance to recover.Dr. Grblex thinks that the aliens are wrong to focus so much on the xe2x80x9cchemical imbalancexe2x80x9d theory of recessions. Instead of attributing them to a shortage of oil, they should pay more attention to a history of  trauma. As evidence, he presents his alternative theory that the 1970s  recession was caused by traumatic memories of the various wars between Israel and the Arab countries, which led the Arabs to impose their oil embargo in the first place. Instead of materializing oil, they should  try to help the Arabs and Israelis overcome their past trauma, which would lead humanity to resume producing oil naturally.Dr. Xjvar insists that xe2x80x9crecessionxe2x80x9d is a natural part of the boom-bust  cycle, and that trying to treat it prevents human civilization from  growing. For example, an oil shortage might encourage them to develop  renewable energy, or a coronavirus epidemic might spur their investment  in biotechnology. He thinks that pathologizing recession stigmatizes human civilizations that donxe2x80x99t focus on economic growth xe2x80x93 but there are  many other valuable things humans can focus on.(if youxe2x80x99re seeing this in your mindxe2x80x99s eye, picture it all as being  underneath a giant solid-light hologram advertising Vraylar. Nowhere in the galaxy is safe from the Vraylar ads)IV.The global economy behaves like a huge dynamical system. Everything  affects everything else in so many different ways that itxe2x80x99s hard to keep  track of.If aliens tried to model the economy the same way Borsboom et al are modeling the mind, theyxe2x80x99d fail. They could pick ten important  economic indicators xe2x80x93 maybe employment rate, the S&P 500, inflation,  and a few other things xe2x80x93 and track how they co-evolved over time. This  would probably be illuminating xe2x80x93 for all I know some economist in our  world is doing it already and learning a lot. But it wouldnxe2x80x99t be enough. They would never  be able to predict a recession caused by conflict in the Middle East causing an oil embargo causing an energy shortage. Or a recession caused by deregulation of banks causing them to offer too many subprime loans causing all of them to go belly-up at once. They wouldnxe2x80x99t be  able to predict whether government policy would shorten a recession or make it worse, whether international trade could help prop up a  collapsing country or drag it further down. At best they would sort of understand some of the principles behind  why this sort of thing is so hard. They could understand that recessions (and booms) are attractor states in a massively complex dynamical  system, and come up with vague principles about how that system responds  to certain shocks (eg xe2x80x9clarge stimulus packages can sometimes shift the  system from recession to normal growthxe2x80x9d).I think the mind is at least this complicated. Just to take one  especially well-understood example: some food includes vitamin B9. An  enzyme in your body called MTHFR helps change vitamin B9 into the active form  l-methylfolate. L-methylfolate helps a waste chemical in the body  called homocysteine turn into a helpful chemical called SAM-e, and  prevents another helpful chemical called tetrahydrobiopterin from  decomposing into a waste chemical called dihydrobiopterin. SAM-e and  tetrahydrobiopterin are cofactors for the enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase  and tyrosine hydroxylase, which change the amino acids tryptophan and  tyrosine into serotonin and dopamine, respectively. And serotonin and  dopamine are known to be heavily involved in mood and energy level. Almost every step in this cycle is a potential depression treatment.  Studies support l-tryptophan, SAM-e, and l-methylfolate supplementation  as antidepressants (also, eating healthy in ways that get you more  vitamin B9). But each step regulates all of the other steps in complex  ways. For example, giving someone too much tyrosine might decrease the  levels of tryptophan in their brain, because these two amino acids  compete for a fixed number of transporters. The moral of the story isnxe2x80x99t  xe2x80x9cSAM-e good, homocysteine badxe2x80x9d, itxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9ctherexe2x80x99s a tendency for SAM-e to  be good and homocysteine bad, but either one could help or hurt  depending on how the system stabilizes after supplementation with either  changes the state of all the other variablesxe2x80x9d.(It might sound like Ixe2x80x99m hawking companies like Genetic Genie  that try to measure exactly how much of each of these you have in your  body and tell you what your own personalized levels and deficiencies are. These companies would be great except for one thing: at present, we  donxe2x80x99t know enough to do this effectively, and they donxe2x80x99t work. Yes, that includes whichever really fancy new high-tech company with lots of  testimonials from hotshot doctors and professors is getting all the VC  money this year. If we ever get anything that works better than trial and error, I will let you know.)And this is just one tiny part of your metabolism. What we know about metabolism so far looks like this:(source)And thatxe2x80x99s just what we know so far! Right now the best we can  do is the same as the aliensxe2x80x99 best xe2x80x93 drop a lot of chemicals down in  random places, in a way that has worked pretty often in the past, and hope it helps more than it hurts.In conclusion, taxometrics offers a useful way of understanding  smoothed-out lifetime averages of mental disorders: as traits or taxa  that differ among people. But many mental disorders evolve over time;  depression comes in discrete episodes that start at some point and get better at some other point; bipolar comes in patterned waves of mania, depression, and euthymia. To understand these conditions, we have to add a dynamical systems perspective and think of episodes as attractor states.Some mental disorders are pure traits without much dynamism xe2x80x93 I think  personality disorders, ADHD, and autism fall into this category.Others are purely dynamical systems, where patients can sometimes be  perfectly healthy, but occasionally they shift into a different  attractor state. You could sort of think of this as having the xe2x80x9ctraitxe2x80x9d  of a weirdly-shaped attractor basin if you want, but therexe2x80x99s still a clear distinction between health and disease. I think depression and  bipolar disorder fall into this category.But most are combinations xe2x80x93 patients have some consistent trait, but  also sometimes have xe2x80x9cflare-upsxe2x80x9d where the trait gets worse than usual,  or xe2x80x9cgood timesxe2x80x9d where the trait is better than usual. I think anxiety  disorders, panic disorder, and schizophrenia are like this. Therexe2x80x99s also  a condition called xe2x80x9cdouble depressionxe2x80x9d, which combines a constant  dysthymia with occasional more serious major depressive episodes xe2x80x93 an  elegant demonstration of the complex relationship between trait-like and dynamical  disorders!For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Ontology Of Psychiatric Conditions: Dynamical Systems - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions-34e"}

They're a type of trustless, decentralized expertise that often equals or outperforms official sources. But they're not quite the present. Right now I only know of three prediction markets, and none of them live up to their potential. As usual, itxe2x80x99s the governmentxe2x80x99s fault: betting on prediction markets is technically gambling, which makes it mostly illegal (of course, you can still buy all the Gamestop stock you want). Each of the three big prediction markets tries to solve this in a different way.PredictIt struck a special deal with the government where they can run a limited number of predictions as long as nobody is allowed to bet very much. They probably have the most users, but most of them are dumb money, and the restrictions prevent smart money from coming in and replacing them. Also, the market fritters away its limited number of predictions on dumb political horse race stuff. I think of this as a missed opportunity.Augur is a decentralized Ethereum-based prediction market.  Since it's crypto, it ought to be able to violate laws with impunity, and in theory this should make it the leader of the pack. In practice it's either nonfunctional or so minimally functional as to be useless. The team involved seems pretty dedicated and competent, and I assume they have some good reason for pretending their product currently exists instead of replacing the whole thing with a COMING SOON banner. I hope this will one day be our savior. But like the real Messiah, itxe2x80x99s taking its sweet time.Metaculus solves the regulatory problem by using fake Internet points instead of money. This is a disappointing solution; it limits the user base to Internet obsessives instead of (say) investment bankers. Still, there are a lot of Internet obsessives. And the team running it is really top-notch, interested in pushing the limits of what prediction markets can do, and trying to focus on some of the most important questions. I want to raise awareness of prediction markets, and right now Metaculus seem like the best people to raise awareness of. So welcome to Metaculus Mondays, where I make you listen to reports of how the prediction markets did this week and what they're predicting for later.This week: the coronavirus.Late last year, when coronavirus had already killed 285,000 Americans, Metaculus asked users to predict how many would be dead by the end of 2021. The guesses started at about 500,000. But as cases rose further through December and January, the guesses rose too, until now they're averaging almost 690,000 people. Right now 440,000 people have died, so Metaculus expects another 250,000. Right now 3,500 people die of COVID daily. If that death rate continued, we'd be past their estimate for December by April. But it's reasonable to expect deaths to decrease as winter turns to spring, more people get vaccinated, and the usual control system causing people to lock down tighter as deaths rise kicks in. Still, I notice that every day their estimate rises slightly. Seems suspicious. I'm betting my fake Internet points on something a little higher, maybe 750,000, with a long tail in case of variants that can reinfect the already infected, or if so many people refuse vaccination that we don't have herd immunity for the danger period in winter 2021.Moving on:When will some official like the Director of the CDC announce that a coronavirus vaccine is available to any adult who wants it (as opposed to just front-line workers, only seniors, etc)? The question as asked is a little odd, since it will probably be available in some areas before others, but this is apparently about some kind of nationwide announcement.Apparently Anthony Fauci said \"as early as April\", former HHS secretary Alex Azar said \"March or early April\", and former FDA chief Scott Gottleib says \"heading into fall 2021\". Metaculus users fall in the middle at May 19. This doesn't seem to have changed too drastically since the question opened in December. I don't think I disagree too strongly here.Next up:When will 50% of the US population be vaccinated? Metaculus defines this as getting both doses of a two-dose vaccine; right now 1.5% of Americans are vaccinated by this definition. Metaculus seems to think we'll reach 50% by June. My main reason for pessimism is that only about 50% of Americans really want the COVID vaccine immediately - the rest say they'll \"wait and see\". Some of those people probably will be satisfied once there are no major side effects. Others will see COVID rates go down (as they inevitably will during the spring) and decide they don't need it. I don't think the average Metaculan truly understands the difficulty involved in getting random people to accept public health interventions in any situation other than \"you will die IMMEDIATELY if you don't do this\". And there's a wild card scenario where the virus mutates, the vaccine doesn't work as well, and people decide it's no longer worth it.Next up:The specific question is \"Will a new variant of SARS-COV-2 that, due to a mutation, can infect people who had immunity to a previous variant, cause more than 10M infections globally by the end of 2021?\"But I'm not happy with how it's phrased. My understanding is that probably some new strains will have a 1% or 10% or whatever chance of infecting already-immune people - lower than infecting coronavirus-naive people, but still more than zero. If a strain that can infect immune people at a 1% rate infects 10 million (mostly non-immune) people, does that count? Since this question doesn't say, I don't think it's that meaningful. Which is too bad, because it's probably the most important question of 2021 and the one that should be getting the most attention right now. Anyway, 260 people say an average of 37% chance, which sounds vaguely horrifying, even if we can't quantify exactly how horrified we should feel.Okay, now we're getting into things we can be properly horrified about. The exact question is \"Before 2023, will the United States CDC recommend that those who have already been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) be vaccinated again due to a mutation in the virus?\"The average is 60% yes! This is probably going to happen! I might write more on this later, but we haven't prepared the regulatory framework we need to deal with this, gotten the public ready for this, or anything. Right now regulators' default assumption should be that we need to plan what to do about COVID-21, COVID-22, et cetera, and get to work figuring out how we're going to screw this up less badly than we screwed up the last one.This one is some creepy deep magic. It's Metaculus really pushing the limit of what you can do with prediction markets. On September 1, before the US had really decided whether or not to hold human challenge trials for vaccines, Metaculus asked its users to predict how many Americans would die of COVID in 2021 if they (did/didn't) allow the challenge trials (ie experiments where they test vaccines by deliberately infecting volunteers). The market concluded that if they did, 295,000 people would die; if they didn't, 343,000 people would die.You don't have to believe them if you don't want to. But this is a pretty impressive example of decentralized expertise weighing in on important inputs to a policy question. Should we hold human challenge trials or not? Well, if we don't, an extra 50,000 people or so will die. You can do this with any question. How much will global temperatures increase if we (do/don't) rejoin the Paris Agreement? How much will British GDP be in 2025 if there (is/isn't) Brexit? How many people will get shot by cops next year if we (do/don't) go ahead with some defund-the-police plan? We shouldn't be the sort of straw-man technocrats who unthinkingly choose the lowest number because Our Metrics Perfectly Capture Reality. But in this case Ixe2x80x99m pretty okay with being the sort of technocrat who thinks about it for a second, remembers that the lower number represents 50,000 real breathing human beings who get to be alive instead of dead, and then goes with it.(in the real world, we didn't do human challenge trials, 100K people have already died this year, and it's only February)And finally, since you've been bearing with me so nicely, here's something a little on the lighter side, from PredictIt:All right guys, HERE'S HOW HILLARY COULD STILL WIN...For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Metaculus Monday - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/metaculus-monday"}

The main things I learned: another way of thinking about the difference between racemic, d-, and meth- amphetamine is the ratio of central to peripheral effects. One major reason druggies prefer methamphetamine to unsubstituted is because itxe2x80x99s easier to make. I was wrong about Vyvanse; it gets cleaved by red blood cells, not the liver.

You can read more from Glen Weyl on his website, his Twitter, or by buying his book. I am grateful for your taking the  time to respond. There is a lot there to respond to and in general I  think the exchange speaks for itself. However, I think there are few  points where clarification is important for the exchange to be   productive, which I'll briefly address here. 1. Let  me start with concessions. There are many points where @slatestarcodex  correctly highlights various areas where my grasp of beliefs and facts  are limited or wrong, especially in the depth of my grasp of the views  of the rationalist community. I freely admit that there are serious  limits to how much I've been able to research the views of people in  this community and I certainly hope they are not as I characterized  them, though as I will point out below many elements of Scott's response  confirm my concerns. 2. Given the last point, I  fully acknowledge the danger of throwing stones lest I shatter my own  glass house. However, leaving aside any blame, I think to make sense of  my piece and Scott's response requires a bit of context that clearly he  lacked. First, outside some specific blog post I wrote, I am best known  as a mechanism designer. To cast me as a general opponent of technology  and mechanisms runs against literally everything I am known for and have  worked on my whole career. The piece was as much a self-critique and  caution about taking the sorts of work I do in the wrong, over-zealous  spirit as I had seen many in the rationalist community doing as anything  else. Second, if responding to anything directly, it was this review of  my book by https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191533  I think that piece perfectly exemplifies the spirit I am responding to  and critiquing. I think we need to avoid that spirit of mechanism  design.3. Scott claims that critics of technocracy  always critique precisely the same examples. This is odd, given that my  essay  has several examples outside that cannon. Did Scott not see  these? I was blowing the whistle on one (https://promarket.org/2020/05/28/how-market-design-economists-engineered-economists-helped-design-a-mass-privatization-of-public-resources/) at roughly the same time I wrote the technocracy piece. These are  contemporary, not chestnuts, and conducted by precisely the circle (https://promarket.org/2020/05/28/how-market-design-economists-engineered-economists-helped-design-a-mass-privatization-of-public-resources/)whose condescending critiques of transparency and public engagement I was responding to.4.  Furthermore, the positive examples of technocracy @slatestarcodex  refers to are...surprising. Two examples. To call school desegregation a  technocratic invention papers over decades of community activism for  desegregation. Perhaps even more dramatically looking at the coronavirus  as an example of the success of technocracy runs against pretty much  any reasonable reading of the international data. Danielle Allen and I  have a piece coming out on this (we were both deeply involved in developing a response plan here https://ethics.harvard.edu/Covid-Roadmap   that significantly influenced now-President Biden's response), but  perhaps the sharpest point here is that the country, Taiwan, which  performed best in the virus was led in part by Audrey Tang who moved  back to Taiwan after being immersed in and repulsed by the rationalist  movement in Silicon Valley - see e.g. https://www.wired.com/story/how-taiwans-unlikely-digital-minister-hacked-the-pandemic/) and dedicated herself to doing things differently in Taiwan (see her amazing poetic job description here: August 23rd 20165.  The last part of the piece is explicitly about the role I see mechanism  playing in a democracy. I find it hard to understand how one could see  the piece as opposed to mechanisms. My argument was that the appropriate  way for mechanisms to be adopted is through public  communication across lines of difference and in different value  systems/communicative modes. One thing I find striking in the history of  technology is that the vast majority of technologies that are actually  useful today were pioneered by people who had similar critiques to mine  here of technocracy, while those who zealous defend technocratic  approaches have generally either not themselves actually developed  successful technologies or have great technological dreams that have  generally led to poor social outcomes.  Consider Douglas Engelbart,  Norbert Wiener, Jaron Lanier, etc. Calling people like this, most of  whom were not even willing to express their views in the rationalistic  terms I wrote in, \"anti-technology\" redefines technology to be only  rigid and inhuman systems that fail.  The process of socio-technological  change has a far greater element of the \"socio\" when it succeeds than  those focused on autonomous \"technology\" allow. Communication and  collaboration outside of affordances of the technology itself are always  critical to success.  See, for example, Don Norman's Design of Everyday  Things, or anything else in the field of human-centered design. 6.  I think @slatestarcodex's insistence on breaking apart mechanisms v.  judgement from top-down v. bottom-up misses a key part of the argument  and of what sociologists of science have long said. There is no unitary  thing called \"science\" or \"mechanism\". There are a variety of  disciplines of information processing across academic fields, across  cultures, across communities with in a culture, etc. \"Mechanism\" is just  how one group of people seeks to claim that their mode of reasoning is  uniquely unbiased and unaccountable to other ways of processing  information. It is precisely this move, the unwillingness to think,  speak or justify oneself on terms acceptable to those who think  differently from you, that his response manifests and that concerns me. 7.  A particularly striking example of this was his identification of  \"democracy\" with the one-person-one-vote rule, an identification I have  in the past been guilty of (hence the self-critique). This is not  coterminal with what democracy means to most people, nor how most political  scientists think of it. I will not belabor this here, but I think it is  a nice illustration of how much one's views can be narrowed by only  looking through a \"mechanistic\" lens. 8.

Nobody ever defends technocracy. It's like \"elitism\" or \"statism\". There is no Statist Party. Nobody holds rallies demanding more statism. There is no Citizens for Statism Facebook page with thousands of likes and followers. Yet for some reason libertarians don't win every single national election. Strange, isn't it?Maybe itxe2x80x99s one of those Russell conjugations - \"I am firm, you are obstinate\". I support rule of law, you're a statist. I want checks and balances on mob rule, you're an elitist. I like evidence-based policy, you're a technocrat.I am not defending technocracy. But I do like evidence-based policy. So I read with interest Glen Weyl's Why I Am Not A Technocrat. It starts with a short summary of Seeing Like A State. It ties this into modern \"evidence-based policy\" and \"mechanism design\". It talks about how technocrats will always have their own insular culture and biases and paradigms, which prevent them from seeing the real world in its full complexity. Therefore, we should be careful about supposedly \"objective\" policies, and make sure they are always heavily informed by real people's real knowledge. Then it draws on vague rumors of the \"rationalist community\" and a shadowy figure named \"Eliezer Yudkowsky\" to create a completely fictional reimagination of us as a group of benighted people who don't understand any of these things, and just go around saying \"hurr durr top-down systems are great, no way there could possibly be anything our models don't capture.\"I like Seeing Like A State as much as anyone else (though see the caveats in Part VII of my review for some criticisms). But it worries me that everyone analyzes the exact same three examples of the failures of top-down planning: Soviet collective farms, Brasilia, and Robert Moses. Ixe2x80x99d like to propose some other case studies:1. Mandatory vaccinations: Technocrats used complicated mathematical models to determine that mass vaccination would create a \"herd immunity\" to disease. Certain that their models were \"objectively\" correct and so could not possibly be flawed, these elites decided to force vaccines on a hostile population. Despite popular protest (did you know that in 1800s England, anti-smallpox-vaccine rallies attracted tens of thousands of demonstrators?), these technocrats continued to want to \"arrogantly remake the world in their image,\" and pushed ahead with their plan, ignoring normal citizens' warnings that their policies might have unintended consequences, like causing autism.2. School desegregation: Nine unelected experts with Harvard and Yale degrees, using a bunch of Latin terms like a certiori and de facto that ordinary people could not understand let alone criticize, decided to completely upend the traditional education system of thousands of small communities to make it better conform to some rules written in a two-hundred-year-old document. The communities themselves opposed it strongly enough to offer violent resistance, but the technocrats steamrolled over all objections and sent in the National Guard to enforce their orders.3. The interstate highway system: 1950s army bureaucrats with a Prussia fetish decided America needed its own equivalent of the Reichsautobahn. The federal government came up with a Robert-Moses-like plan to spend $114 billion over several decades to build a rectangular grid of numbered giant roads all up and down the country, literally paving over whatever was there before, all according to pre-agreed federal standards. The public had so little say in the process that they started hundreds of freeway revolts trying to organize to prevent freeways from being built through their cities; the government crushed these when it could, and relocated the freeways to less politically influential areas when it couldn't.4. Climate change: In the second half of the 20th century, scientists determined that carbon dioxide emissions were raising global temperatures, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Climatologists created complicated formal models to determine how quickly global temperatures might rise, and economists designed clever from-first-principle mechanisms that could reduce emissions, like cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes. But these people were members of the elite toying with equations that could not possibly include all the relevant factors, and who were vulnerable to their elite biases. So the United States decided to leave the decision up to democratic mechanisms, which allowed people to contribute \"outside-the-system\" insights like \"Actually global warming is fake and it's all a Chinese plot\".5. Coronavirus lockdowns: The government appointed a set of supposedly infallible scientist-priests to determine when people were or weren't allowed to engage in normal economic activity. The scientist-priests, who knew nothing about the complex set of factors that make one person decide to go to a rock festival and another to a bar, decided that vast swathes of economic activity they didn't understand must stop. The ordinary people affected tried to engage in the usual mechanisms of democracy, like complaining, holding protests, and plotting to kidnap their governors - but the scientist-priests, certain that their analyses were \"objective\" and \"fact-based\", thought ordinary people couldn't possibly be smart enough to challenge them, and so refused to budge.Nobody uses the word \"technocrat\" except when they're criticizing something. So \"technocracy\" accretes this entire language around it - unintended consequences, the perils of supposed \"objectivity\", the biases inherent in elite paradigms. And then when you describe something using this language, it's like \"Oh, of course that's going to fail - everything like that has always failed before!\"But if you accept that \"technocracy\" describes things other than Soviet farming, Brasilia, and Robert Moses, the trick stops working. You notice a lot of things you could describe using the same vocabulary were good decisions that went well. Then you have to ask yourself: is Seeing Like A State the definitive proof that technocratic schemes never work? Or is it a compendium of rare man-bites-dog style cases, interesting precisely because of how unusual they are?I want to make it really clear that I'm not saying that technocracy is good and democracy is bad. I'm saying that this is actually a hard problem. It's not a morality play, where you tell ghost stories about scary High Modernists, point vaguely in the direction of Brasilia, say some platitudes about how no system can ever be truly unbiased, and then your work is done. There are actually a bunch of complicated reasons why formal expertise might be more useful in some situations, and local knowledge might be more useful in others.II.Weyl starts by defining technocracy:By technocracy, I mean the view that most of governance and policy should be left to some type of xe2x80x9cexpertsxe2x80x9d, distinguished by meritocratically-evaluated training in formal methods used to xe2x80x9coptimizexe2x80x9d social outcomes...perhaps the most prominent version, especially in democratic countries, is a belief in a technocracy based on a mixture of analytic philosophy, economic theory, computational power and high-volume statistical analysis, often using experimentation. This form of technocracy is a widely held view among much of the academic and high technology elites, among the most powerful groups in the world today. I focus on this tendency as I assume it will be the form of technocracy most familiar and attractive to my readersDid you notice none of Weyl's examples of technocracy fit this definition at all? Robert Moses had zero formal training in urban planning or anything related to city-building. The Soviet leadership wasn't \"meritocratically chosen\". And Oscar Niemeyer didn't construct a High Modernist planned village and a control village, test which one performed better on various metrics, and scale the winner up into Brasilia. (I'm not saying it would necessarily have gone well if he did - maybe the principles don't scale, or maybe he would have chosen the wrong metrics, or maybe any of a thousand other things could have gone wrong. But it would have been better than what he actually tried, which was to take some weird aesthetic choices by Le Corbusier and follow them off a cliff. Weyl takes exactly the thing Niemeyer didn't do, then uses the failure of his project to argue that doing it is bad!)I think Weyl's idea of \"technocracy\" is incoherent because he's trying to combine several different axes into one word. Some of these might be:1. Top-down intervention vs. bottom-up evolution. Did a system evolve on its own in a emergent way? Or is some planner coming up with the shape beforehand and ordering it to be enacted? To some degree bottom-up evolution makes the other axes irrelevant - \"technocracy\" and \"democracy\" are both forms of government, and if the government's not intervening then there's no question about who decides what form the intervention takes.2. Mechanism vs. judgment. Is the system determined by some sort of algorithmic mechanism, like \"We'll enact whichever plan ends up with the highest price in our prediction market\" / \"Our school will admit whoever scores highest on the admission exam\"? Or does it rely on human judgment, ie \"We'll enact whichever plan our assembly reaches consensus around\" / \"Our school will admit whoever holistically seems to match our values the best\"?3. Autarchy vs. democracy. This is obviously a spectrum, since even the most totalitarian dictator has a few advisors, and even the most democratic country still has presidents and prime ministers. But it seems fair to say Robert Moses was less democratic than some more touchy-feely city planner, so sure.4. Expert opinion vs. popular opinion. Again, obviously a spectrum. There are subquestions here where nobody disagrees - shouldn't there be some doctors and epidemiologists at the FDA and WHO? But I think it's fair to say that there's a distinction between a country where doctors and epidemiologists can unilaterally ban cigarettes vs. one where that decision is made at a more democratic level.5. Victims ignored vs. victims consulted. This is slightly different from the expert vs. popular axis, in that a plan to regulate farmers might be popular among the masses but not incorporate advice from or opinions from farmers themselves. Weyl makes a big deal about whether planners seek democratic feedback, but I am suspicious of how much this really varies. Suppose you're the FDA trying to regulate cigarettes, and your doctors and bureaucrats have come up with a plan. What do you do now to \"seek democratic feedback\"? Put a suggestion box outside the FDA office? Invite randomly selected smokers to FDA headquarters to tell you what they think? Just assume that, since elected officials appointed the FDA director, you're okay?These axes prove their use when we use them to analyze Weyl's vs. Scott's conceptions of \"legibility\". The two use the word in exact opposite ways; Weyl is interested in whether technocrats' plans are legible to the populace; Scott is interested in whether the populace's activities are legible to technocrats. Weyl claims that technocrats' plans are hard for the masses to understand. Scott thinks exactly the opposite: when Oscar Niemeyer says \"let's build giant apartment buildings separated by a rectangular grid of roads\", he can easily list the advantages - short commutes, speedy traffic, impossible to get lost. It's only the disadvantages - \"it wouldn't feel like home\", \"I kind of like being in crowds sometimes\" - that are hard to express. The advantages of collective farming are obvious: specialize in one crop, gains from working together instead of competing with each other, use the most advanced industrial farming techniques. The disadvantages are so arcane that you would have to be a farmer yourself with complicated agricultural craft to understand them.  The technocrats can always point to X% GDP increases, Y extra jobs, and the like; the masses are stuck saying \"It doesn't feel right\". I think what's going on here is that Scott is almost uniquely focusing on the bottom-up vs. top-down axis; he thinks top-down plans are legible and bottom-up plans aren't, and he calls the former \"technocracy\". Weyl doesn't care at all about this axis; he seems to be assuming top-down intervention will happen, and talking about what kind of top-down intervention (in terms of the other four axes) we're going to get. As a result, the two of them talk past each other in a bizarre way.In another case, Weyl critiques neoreaction while accidentally parroting its talking points; this foundational neoreactionary essay is spookily similar to Weyl's own. This is because both Weyl and the neoreactionaries agree profoundly on taking the judgment side of the judgment vs. mechanism axis, but disagree on the autarchy vs. democracy one.I find Axes 1, 3, 4, and 5 kind of boring once we take the time to decompose them. Everybody's already argued the merits of government intervention vs. libertarianism, of populism vs. elitism, etc. Weyl seems to have a special interest in Axis 2 - mechanism vs. human judgment - and I think this is the most interesting potential point of disagreement.III.From Weyl:In short, we are very far from discovering formalisms capable of capturing and quantifying most of the critical inputs to policy and systems design for a decent society. So much of what we still need lives in e.g. the low-income housing developments, the lived experiences of workers facing powerful corporations, the NGOs on the ground in Myanmar, and the community educational justice groups. To the extent that technocracy is a practice of insulating policy makers and system designers from the need to justify themselves in the language of, clearly explain their designs to and maintain open lines of communication from these highly informative channels, it leads to large-scale failures, corruption, crises and justified political backlash and outrage.Why would anyone ever want mechanism? Why would we want to use formalisms? Human decision-making is so versatile and so good at taking account of outside-the-system problems that limiting ourselves to mechanical models would pointlessly cripple us, right?I'm a fan of doing things formally. My answer to the above challenge is: mechanism is constraining on purpose. It's constraining in the same sense that tying yourself to the mast so that Sirens don't lure you to a watery doom is constraining. Mathematical formalism is a trick for securing a system against bias and corruption. Let me give four examples:1. Mechanical district creation: Mathematicians have developed various ways of automatically creating Congressional districts, usually something like \"tile the state with compact polygons\". Maybe this is inferior to having wise people who truly understand the state and its complex needs draw districts that group naturally-related areas together and make sure everyone has an equal say. But somehow whenever we ask our wise-people-who-truly-understand-the-state to do this, they always come up with weird pipe-cleaner shapes that vote exactly 51% Republican. I admit there are many ways to solve this besides tiling the state with compact polygons. But if we can't make any of the other ones work, tiling the state with compact polygons would beat how we do things now.2. Aptitude-test-based admissions to colleges: This is how most countries other than the US do things. But 1920s deans realized this let in too many Jews, so they changed it to a holistic admissions process where wise representatives of our cultural values holistically scanned the good and bad aspects of every applicant. In the past, this system was a fig leaf for excluding Jews; today, it's a fig leaf for excluding Asians, and for letting people whose parents donate lots of money get in through the back door. This isn't just true for colleges - we know that giving everyone IQ tests and letting the top scorers into gifted programs ends up with better representation of gifted minorities than letting teachers use their judgment. One of the most infuriating parts of Weyl's essay is where he talks about how technocracy is bad because it can incorporate subtly racist assumptions into its equations - as if asking random people to make subjective decisions is safer from that failure mode!3. Housing: I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where digging up Robert Moses' corpse and appointing it Perpetual Planning Czar would be way better than what we have now. It turns out when you carefully seek democratic feedback on planning decisions, the feedback is usually \"build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything\", nothing ever gets built, and your city ends up in a terrible housing crisis with lots of people being broke, homeless, and miserable. One of the most exciting plans to solve the NIMBY crisis is SB50, a bill that ennumerates mechanical restrictions on how all zoning decisions have to go, and deliberately blocks affected neighbors from having any say in the process.4. Democracy: For all the supposed opposition of technocracy and democracy, it's worth noting that democratic elections are an example of mechanism in action. Instead of having to come to a consensus on difficult questions, we just compare two numbers - the number of people who vote for the decision, and the number who vote against it - and whichever number is bigger wins. Can you imagine if instead we had to actually figure out what was good? Or if instead of using numbers, we tried to judge the subjective quality of a coalition - this side has more PhDs, but that one has more army veterans? It would end in civil war or dictatorship within a week. It's only the stark quantitative nature of elections that makes them hard to bias or hack.In each case, we don't trust any individual human to make an unbiased decision. So we design some mechanism that's as unbiased as possible, and give it to lots of people so they can check that it's unbiased (in a way that you can never check whether someone's intuition is unbiased). Then we make decisions via the mechanism.In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to do this. In the real world, well - have you heard the story of statistical prediction rules in medicine? Ixccxb6txccxb6'xccxb6sxccxb6 xccxb6nxccxb6oxccxb6txccxb6 xccxb6axccxb6 xccxb6sxccxb6txccxb6oxccxb6rxccxb6yxccxb6 xccxb6txccxb6hxccxb6exccxb6 xccxb6Jxccxb6exccxb6dxccxb6ixccxb6 xccxb6wxccxb6oxccxb6uxccxb6lxccxb6dxccxb6 xccxb6txccxb6exccxb6lxccxb6lxccxb6 xccxb6yxccxb6oxccxb6uxccxb6.xccxb6  Some people analyzed a bunch of data, came up with an algorithm for diagnosing psychosis, and told doctors they should use the algorithm instead of their own judgment. Everyone who hears this story expects the moral to be that no amount of \"smartest guy in the room\" data-crunching can match the holistic experience of trained doctors with years of domain experience - but in fact the algorithms won hands-down. The interesting part (search \"Goldberg Rule\" in that link) is what happens when you give doctors an algorithm and tell them to use it to supplement their judgment. This doctor-algorithm team usually still does worse than the algorithm alone. And if you explain this to the doctor - say \"I know you think you're going to outperform the algorithm, but actually doctor-algorithm teams usually lose to the algorithm alone, so you're probably better off just sticking the algorithm unless you're really sure you have some special knowledge\" - the algorithm still wins. In this case, supplementing the technocratic method with human judgment just plain worsens the technocratic method. I don't know if this carries over to more society-relevant decisions, but it's the sort of thing you have to consider. The people who devise mechanisms can sometimes be biased. But they can't apply their biases very accurately. Perhaps the decision to make Congressional districts compact hexagons instead of compact pentagons might very subtly favor Republicans in some way. But it would favor Republicans less than getting a bunch of Republicans together to draw every district in exactly the way that favors Republicans the most; there's a limit to how biased a short hexagon-drawing algorithm can get. Likewise, if you wanted to bias a college admissions algorithm against Asians, you could perhaps weight math test scores a bit lower than English test scores. But that would bias it less than just having some guy who can look at Asian applicants and say \"Nope, not him\". Also, mechanisms are transparent and can be inspected. The entire country could turn its scrutiny on the decision to weight math tests less in the algorithm - whereas if you're just using \"human judgment\", each particular example of the admissions officer rejecting an Asian will pass unknown to anyone but the candidate involved.This isn't trying to say mechanism is always good and judgment is always bad! We can predict cases where one might be better than the other - and as with the doctor studies and the gifted program studies, we can test when one is better than the other. I'm just trying to say it's an interesting question that you can't resolve just by throwing a copy of Seeing Like A State at someone.IV.I want to briefly respond to Weyl's critique of rationality and effective altruism:The effective altruism movement, which largely grew directly out of the rationalist movement, seeks to maximize the efficacy with which charitable donations are directed using standard rationalist methods. It is a tight-knit community that strongly privileges rationalist approaches over all other forms of knowledge-making (such as from the humanities, continental philosophy, or humanistic social sciences) and tends to dismiss input not formulated in rationalist terms. The community also has a strong and explicitly stated view that its activities uniquely contribute to the achievement of xe2x80x9cthe goodxe2x80x9d: of their top five recommendations of most productive careers by a leading community organization, two suggest being a researcher or support staff within the movement, and two others recommend working on the AI alignment problem (see the next point). Until recently, much of the analysis and funding emerging from the community has pointed towards a focus on extremely unlikely but potentially catastrophic risks, such as alien, asteroid or biological catastrophes.Weyl wrote this essay a few months before COVID, so his pooh-poohing of the idea that there might be a biological catastrophe is an unfortunate anachronism. But I think it's important to note that we got this right (and he got it wrong) precisely because we \"privilege rationalist approaches over all other forms of knowledge-making\". People like Toby Ord tried to calculate the risk of every kind of disaster and how bad it would be - and at the same time Weyl was making fun of us for caring about biological catastrophes, Ord was writing about how the numbers suggested zoonotic diseases from bats could cause catastrophic pandemics. This kind of work ultimately led to EA flagship group Open Philanthropy Project spending almost $50 million on its Biosecurity And Pandemic Preparedness Program between 2014 and 2019; if other people had taken a few minutes to read our arguments instead of chiding us for how naive it is to prioritize things based on rational methods, maybe the world would have been more prepared.Trying to be charitable to Weyl, I think he's thinking of the EA movement as trying to perfectly quantify exactly how many lives can be saved per dollar, then following that number off a cliff. I can see how a ten-minute scan of the movement could get that impression, but I think even a thirty-minute one would correct the misimpression. EA does the quantification as a guide to other forms of reasoning. There is no way to perfectly calculate the devastation of a potential pandemic that hasn't happened yet. But once you make even a weak effort, you notice that all the numbers are really really big. And once you make an effort to quantify the importance of the cause du jour supported by the humanities and continental philosophy, sometimes you notice that under every set of reasonable assumptions it's smaller than the other number. And of course you supplement this with lots of trying to understand the complicated unquantifiable issues involved - under no circumstance do you skip that step - but you're just trying to do an analysis that has some contact with some reality-based number and isn't entirely dependent on the popular mood about something. I think this successfully achieves the difficult balance between model-laden technicalities and messy real life, and whatever form of reasoning Weyl was using to let him dismiss biological risks without doing any modeling failed to achieve that balance.(maybe this is a bravery debate - I believe almost everyone is using fuzzy human judgment and guidance from the humanities to decide how to best improve the world, and injecting a little bit of science is a powerful innovation. If Weyl believes the opposite, then it would make sense for him to recommend the injection of a little more human judgment - although then he would have to explain how so many amazing-by-rational-standards charities were underfunded before EA came along, and how many useless-by-rational-standards ones were rolling in money.)Moving on:Yet, interestingly, the conclusions of the analysis emerging from the community increasingly undermine these foci and the approach of the community more broadly. In particular, recent research in the community suggests that the greatest and most probable risks to be avoided are anthropogenic (climate change, nuclear war, the rise of a totalitarian regime, other environmental catastrophes etc.). Leaders in the community have in turn suggested that the most effective ways to avoid these are likely finding solutions to problems of political organization and legitimacy of social systems to help reduce the likelihood of conflict or inability to cooperate in the provision of critical global public goods.Weyl's link doesn't support his claim. It's an 80,000 Hours page saying that that it's important to protect the long-term future, something EA has believed since the beginning. EA started with a sort of merger and cross-pollination between people trying to save lives by eg curing malaria, and transhumanist/singularitarian groups working on protecting the long-term future; it held together because both groups agree that the other's position can make sense given different sets of complicated assumptions about ethics and tractability. The page Weyl links highlights and explains the philosophy around that, but does not claim anyone had a sudden enlightenment where they realized they'd previously been ignoring the threat of totalitarianism and that was wrong. Everyone has always believed that stopping the rise of a totalitarian regime is one part of the important task of protecting the far-future, but we haven't focused on it because it's less tractable and less neglected than other parts. As far as I know we continue to think that and mostly not focus on it aside from occasionally looking for tractable interventions we've missed.All of this is too bad, because if Weyl was right, that would be a huge point in favor of rational methods. Imagine pointing to a community that did something wrong for years, then learned that thing was wrong, then admitted it and changed - and imagine thinking of it as a strike against that community's methods!Worse, the extremely elitist, segregated, and condescending approach to philanthropy encouraged by the community has created widespread public backlash that has closely tracked a broader populist reaction to technologically-driven globalist elites and that increasingly seems to be one of the largest risk factors for precisely the sorts of catastrophes effective altruists increasingly see as the largest threats to their long-term viewpoint on universal welfare. In short, it increasingly seems like, after almost a decade of existence, a primary conclusion of the movementxe2x80x99s analysis may be that the movement itself is a significant part of the problem it is identifying. Earlier, more open dialog with a broader range of approaches and social classes might have illuminated this more quickly and avoided the associated waste of talent and resources, two things the movement greatly prizes.Actually, most of the complaints I've heard have been from people like Weyl (Princeton PhD, Harvard postdoc, Principal Researcher at Microsoft New England). The xe2x80x9cwidespread public backlashxe2x80x9d link goes to a book by Anand Giridharadas (Harvard PhD student, former McKinsey consultant, New York Times columnist). The actual normal people I talk to are broadly supportive. Some of my blog commenters are populist Trump supporters, and although they sometimes tell me I'm crazy for donating my money the way I do, they accept I have the right to spend it how I want and don't bother me much about it.I worry that Weyl is kind of cargo-culting a response to populism, a sort of \"The masses hate science and reason and improving things, right? So maybe if we never do any of that stuff then they'll let us live\". This hasn't been my experience of the masses. My experience has been they hate elites trying to lecture them on what to do, especially if justified in pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo that they can see through easily.  So, people who want to donate their own money according to their own understanding about what the best causes are is fine. Bill Gates isn't officially affiliated with the EA movement, but he's a broadly-aligned role model who donates to the same causes EAs do using the same data-based methods. Last time anyone checked, Gates had an approval rating of 76%, the second-highest of any figure asked about and literally higher than God. I donxe2x80x99t think Gates should be considered a backlash-inducing failure.And would Weyl's suggestions really help prevent populist backlashes? He wishes we abandoned our overly-rational ways in favor of \"humanities, Continental philosophy, and the humanistic social sciences\" - isn't that usually code for stuff like queer theory, postcolonial theory, and postmodernism? Are working-class Trump supporters really banging on their keyboards when they read about effective altruism, shouting \"YOU NEED TO STOP TRYING TO BE OBJECTIVE AND FACT-BASED, AND BE MORE OPEN TO INSIGHTS FROM QUEER THEORY AND POSTMODERNISM\"?This doesn't necessarily mean those things are bad - populaces can backlash against all sorts of good things; maybe these fields have potentially valuable insights. But I don't think it's fair to demand other people optimize their philosophy to avoid completely hypothetical populist backlashes, while you're saying the most tone-deaf populist-backlash-provoking stuff imaginable. I am a member of the populace and I am so backlashed about Weyl's suggestions that I wrote this whole essay just to argue how wrong they were.The section on AI is much worse than this, and I think it would be kinder to everyone involved to just pass over it entirely.I continue to appreciate Seeing Like A State's critique of...the thing it critiques, which is somewhat but not exactly similar to our word \"technocracy\". I think it's important to internalize that critique. But I think internalizing it is different from making it your One Hedgehog Tool that applies to everything everywhere. There are separate critiques of top-down intervention, mechanistic decision-making, autocracy, expert opinions, and lack of bottom-up feedback. All of those critiques are important - and all of them are matched by equally important reasons why sometimes you would want to use those things to some degree.I think it's important not to collapse everything into just \"technocracy bad, details to be provided later\". You can't just present Brasilia and use that as an argument against randomized controlled trials! You can't just argue that forced collectivization of farms caused famines, therefore people shouldn't voluntarily assess where to donate their charity money to best meet their own goals! Maybe I'm being too technocratic here, but at some point you need to break things down, look at this (social) scientifically, and try to figure out which parts of things are consistently bad and which parts sometimes seem to help.I think the rationalist and EA communities have been working on the project of trying to develop the metis of balancing all of this correctly, and I continue to be optimistic about our progress on that front.EDIT: See Glen Weylxe2x80x99s response here.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Contra Weyl On Technocracy - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/contra-weyl-on-technocracy"}

For example, consider humans and rabbits. If we  take a mixed group containing some humans and some rabbits, and graph  them along some variable like weight, it would probably look like this:Therexe2x80x99s one big obvious group around 3 lbs (weight of the average  rabbit) and another around 140 lbs (weight of the average human). Not a lot of subtletly here. If we used some other graphable variable xe2x80x93  height, lifespan, IQ xe2x80x93 wexe2x80x99d probably get something similar.Maybe the biggest rabbit in the world is bigger than the  smallest human. That doesnxe2x80x99t mean theyxe2x80x99re not two obvious categories.  It just means theyxe2x80x99re two obvious categories with a tiny overlap. It  happens. If we wanted to be clever, we could create a multivariate  distance measure that combines weight, height, lifespan, IQ, and lots of  other ways humans and rabbits could differ, into a 0 xe2x80x93 1 variable where  0 is xe2x80x9cmost rabbityxe2x80x9d and 1 is xe2x80x9cmost humanishxe2x80x9d. Probably these scores  wouldnxe2x80x99t overlap at all xe2x80x93 if they did, it would mean therexe2x80x99s some human  whoxe2x80x99s more like a rabbit than some rabbit is, which would be pretty  surprising. But even if this were true, it wouldnxe2x80x99t change the  fundamental finding that humans and rabbits are pretty different. Or to  put it some other way, therexe2x80x99s a fundamental hidden generator producing  differences between humans and rabbits (in this case, the species  difference).By contrast, something is dimensional if itxe2x80x99s just a spectrum  and therexe2x80x99s no obvious place to separate it into different groups. For  example, consider tall people vs. short people. We take a general  cross-section of the population, and graph them by height, and it would  probably look like this:Therexe2x80x99s no clear point where short people stop and tall people begin.  Some people are a little taller than others, and other people taller  still, and so on until youxe2x80x99re at Yao Ming.This doesnxe2x80x99t mean xe2x80x9cheight doesnxe2x80x99t existxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cheight is just a social  constructxe2x80x9d or anything like that. It doesnxe2x80x99t even mean you canxe2x80x99t talk  sensibly about xe2x80x9ctall peoplexe2x80x9d vs. xe2x80x9cshort peoplexe2x80x9d. It just means that  Nature doesnxe2x80x99t immediately present you with two distinct categories and a  natural cut-off point in between.What about well-understood physical diseases? Something like the flu  is pretty categorical xe2x80x93 either youxe2x80x99re infected with an influenza virus,  or youxe2x80x99re not. But suppose we donxe2x80x99t have any high-tech flu tests  available. Instead, we must ask people if they have various flu  symptoms, score their answers, and sum up the total. We might end up  getting something that looks like this (not to scale):The big peak on the left represents the large majority of people, who  donxe2x80x99t have flus. Itxe2x80x99s sharp but not infinitely sharp, because some  people without flus will still have a few flu symptoms xe2x80x93 maybe they have  allergies or something. Itxe2x80x99s asymmetrical because there are more ways  to have more flu symptoms than average than to have fewer flu symptoms  than average (especially if the average number of flu symptoms is zero  or otherwise very low).The small hill on the right represents people with the flu. Itxe2x80x99s much  smaller than the left peak, because people with the flu at any given  moment are much less common than healthy people. Itxe2x80x99s also much wider,  because flu can strike at many different levels of severity, so some flu  patients will barely have any more flu symptoms than the average  person, and others will be very sick.Something like hypertension is more dimensional. A graph of how many people have what blood pressures might look like this:This doesnxe2x80x99t obviously separate into two groups, xe2x80x9chypertensivexe2x80x9d and  xe2x80x9cnon-hypertensivexe2x80x9d. We just arbitrarily decide on a cutoff (in the case  of hypertension, 130 mm Hg systolic) and call the people above it  xe2x80x9chypertensivexe2x80x9d and the people below it xe2x80x9cnot-hypertensivexe2x80x9d.In the flu case, we can ask the additional question xe2x80x9cThis person has  few flu symptoms, but is it possible thatxe2x80x99s deceptive and they actually  do have the flu?xe2x80x9d In the case of hypertension, you cannot ask  xe2x80x9cThis person has a low blood pressure, but is it possible thatxe2x80x99s  deceptive and they actually have hypertension?xe2x80x9d It just doesnxe2x80x99t make  sense! In the flu case, wexe2x80x99re using the thing we measure as a proxy for  some underlying fundamental difference (whether theyxe2x80x99re infected with an  influenza virus or not). In the hypertension case, wexe2x80x99re just grading the level of what wexe2x80x99re measuring.So taxometrics is the study of whether psychiatric disorders work more like the flu, or more like hypertension.For example, take generalized anxiety disorder. One possibility is  that some people have some weird brain quirk called xe2x80x9cgeneralized anxiety  disorderxe2x80x9d and the rest of us donxe2x80x99t, and we measure anxiety level to try  to identify the people with that particular brain quirk. Another  possibility is that people just have different anxiety levels, and for  some people that anxiety level is so high that it bothers them, and we  call that xe2x80x9cgeneralized anxiety disorderxe2x80x9d.If we wanted to determine which one of those was true, we might try  giving people a bunch of questions about how anxious they are, then  graphing the answers on a plot like the one above. We already have good  tests for how anxious people are xe2x80x93 things like the GAD-7. So we can just graph GAD-7 scores and then wexe2x80xa6xe2x80xa6in fact, this doesnxe2x80x99t work. Letxe2x80x99s look at the flu graph above again.I admitted above that it wasnxe2x80x99t to scale. If we made it more to  scale, it might look like this (seen separately and color-coded on the  left, combined on the right):Because the xe2x80x9chas fluxe2x80x9d category is so small and so spread-out, itxe2x80x99s  actually really hard to notice the tiny secondary bump representing its  existence as a separate ontological category. If we tried to just  eyeball the distribution of answers on a flu-symptom-questionnaire, we  would end up pretty doubtful that the flu was a real thing. Add in the  inevitable measurement error, and this just isnxe2x80x99t going to be helpful.So actual taxometricians use more complicated statistical methods. Theodore Beauchaine describes three of them here, of which Ixe2x80x99ll try to very briefly explain one of the simplest, MAXCOV.Suppose a category is real and involves at least three correlated  traits. For example, human vs. rabbit involves weight, lifespan, and IQ;  healthy vs. flu involves cough, fever, and muscle pain. Pick one trait xe2x80x93  letxe2x80x99s say cough. If the flu is a real category, then as we go from  lowest-cough-level to highest-cough-level, the people wexe2x80x99re looking at  should gradually go from mostly-not-having-the-flu to 50-50 to  mostly-having-the-flu.In a a group of people who are 100% healthy, 0% flu, fever and muscle  pain should correlate at some level. In a group of people who are 0%  healthy, 100% flu, fever and muscle pain should correlate at some other  level. In a group thatxe2x80x99s 50-50, the correlation should be higher than  either of these! Thatxe2x80x99s because level of fever gives you a clue to who  has the flu, which in turn gives you a clue about who has muscle pain.  In both the 100-0 and 0-100 groups, level of fever doesnxe2x80x99t tell you  anything about who has the flu (everyone has the same flu status), so  the existence of flu doesnxe2x80x99t give you any useful information. That means  that if a categorical difference exists, you should expect the  correlation between fever and muscle pain to peak at the level of cough  that most effectively divides flu patients from non-flu patients.This is Figure 3 from the Beauchaine paper linked above. The first  graph depicts an objectively-existing-categorical depression that works  like species or influenza. As you increase the level of one depression  symptom (unintended  weight loss), the correlation between two other  depression symptoms (early morning awakening and psychomotor retardation)  gradually goes up, peaks at 14, and then starts going down. This  suggests that in this case, depression is a real category, like the flu,  and the best cutoff to separate depressed from non-depressed people is  at 14 of whatever this variable is.The second graph depicts a dimensional depression that works like  height or wealth. As you increase the level of one depression symptom  (insomnia), the correlation between other depression symptoms (sadness  and crying) stays about the same. This seems a bit off to me xe2x80x93 sadness  and crying seem like a uniquely bad pair of symptoms to theorize are  correlated mostly because of the construct of depression xe2x80x93 but whatever,  itxe2x80x99s just an example.Clear as mud? Donxe2x80x99t worry, this isnxe2x80x99t really what most taxometricians  use. They use things that are much more complicated. Any  statisticians reading this might enjoy this paper on using the comparison curve fit index in taxometric analyses; no guarantees about anyone else.II.In the Brief Taxometrics Primer  Ixe2x80x99ve been trying to loosely follow in this post, Beauchaine strongly  suggests, though doesnxe2x80x99t say outright, that most psychiatric disorders  are dimensional, like height and wealth. But a few may be objective  distinct categories, especially schizophrenia, narcissistic personality,  and endogenous depression (a subtype of depression that happens for no reason, as opposed to the kind of depression you get when something bad  happens). This is a completely reasonable set of findings which match my intuition and the intuitions of most other psychiatrists.But the past two decades of research have treated it poorly. The most  up-to-date and comprehensive meta-analysis of taxometric research I can  find is Haslam, McGrath, and Kuppens from 2020  . It strongly agrees with (my read of) Beauchaine that most psychiatric  conditions are dimensional like height or wealth. It is able to find  only hints of exceptions, nothing that it can confidently state is a  true category. But its list of exceptions is completely different from  Beauchainexe2x80x99s, and much less sensible. It points to pedophilia,  addictions (including gambling addiction!), autism, and intermittent  explosive disorder as the most likely candidates for taxonicity (their  fancy word for being a true categorical distinction like species or  flu).Ixe2x80x99ll grant them pedophilia xe2x80x93 it really does seem like people either  are or arenxe2x80x99t pedophiles and therexe2x80x99s something weird and specific going  on there.Addictions (they specifically name alcoholism, nicotine addiction,  and pathological gambling) are more surprising xe2x80x93 doesnxe2x80x99t alcoholism  progress pretty gradually from teetotalers to social drinkers to heavy  drinkers to raging alcoholics? Doesnxe2x80x99t smoking go from the occasional  smoker to pack-a-day smokers to extremely heavy smokers? I havenxe2x80x99t  hunted down all their individual studies, but I suspect this is a sort  of artifact of how people respond to their addictions. For example,  people who have lots of problems with tobacco either successfully quit  and become nonsmokers, or donxe2x80x99t quit and become heavy smokers. So there  might be an artificial divide where the only people who smoke are the  people who do it socially and enjoy it and feel no reason to quit, and  the people who are so addicted they canxe2x80x99t possibly quit.Autism is such an annoying thing to have on this list xe2x80x93 just when  everyone finally agreed there was an xe2x80x9cautism spectrumxe2x80x9d and no clear  difference between neurotypical-people-with-some-autistic-traits and  high-functioning-autistics, along comes this meta-analysis to say nope,  itxe2x80x99s a taxon, neurotypicals and autistics are two clear objectively  separate categories. I did hunt down the studies here and they  actually seemed pretty good. But none of these results are strong enough  to be more than suggestive, so I am going to keep believing in an  autism spectrum until more research comes in.And intermittent explosive disorder! This is the fake disorder we  made up so that we had something to diagnose angry people with! I donxe2x80x99t  think anyone thought this one was real, not even the psychiatrists who  invented it and stuck it in the DSM! But here come the taxometricians,  saying that schizophrenia and bipolar and whatever are mere dimensional  variation, but IED (yes, thatxe2x80x99s really the acronym) is an  honest-to-goodness crisply-defined category based on objective reality?  What gives?And look what isnxe2x80x99t on here xe2x80x93 schizophrenia, which is just a really  obvious separate taxon. You know, the condition where sometimes between  ages 18 and 25 for men and ages 25 to 35 or so for women, over the  course of a few weeks, seemingly normal people start getting extreme  hallucinations and eventually devolve into a state where they often  canxe2x80x99t live a normal life or even speak meaningful sentences? The  taxometricians are saying ah, whatever, it happens to all of us, theyxe2x80x99re  just the people who it happens to more than average? Is that really  what theyxe2x80x99re saying? I think they may have bungled this one, maybe by  over-focusing on studies of negative symptoms, or of psychosis more  generally, but I havenxe2x80x99t looked into it enough to be sure.Overall this is just a really enraging meta-analysis, and even though  their methods look good and they did a lot of work to double-check  their results, I have trouble trusting them. To their credit, they are  pretty careful about what claims they make, and only say that the data  is suggestive of most of their categoricity claims. Maybe instead of focusing on these few tenuous exceptions, we should  focus on the headline result: 75% of findings were xe2x80x9cunambiguously  non-taxonicxe2x80x9d, 17% were xe2x80x9cunambiguously taxonicxe2x80x9d, and 8% were xe2x80x9cambiguousxe2x80x9d.  In other words, the field as a whole pretty strongly suggests that most  psychiatric disorders are just the tail end of normal variation, like  xe2x80x9ctall personxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9crich personxe2x80x9d, and not a separate category like  xe2x80x9crabbitxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9chas the fluxe2x80x9d. Among the conditions that were very strongly  found to be dimensional only were depression, anxiety, and ADHD.In more depth:This is a forest plot of CCFI, the more complicated taxometry  statistic I linked before. CCFI below 0.5 suggests dimensional variation  like height or wealth; above 0.5 suggests true categories like species  or having-the-flu. This plot is using much broader categories than the  individual conditions I mentioned before, but we can see that eating  disorders (like anorexia), childhood disorders (like autism), substance  use (like alcoholism), and a bunch of grab bag categories (including  things like dementia) are most likely to look taxonic.A few other things stand out here. Just for fun, the authors included  some normal personality traits and psychological variables, like  xe2x80x9creligious fundamentalismxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cinterest in sciencexe2x80x9d. I think  (though they donxe2x80x99t say so explicitly) that Big Five traits like  extraversion and so on are also in there. They predictably find low CCFI  for these, meaning theyxe2x80x99re just dimensional normal variation. These are  honestly around the same CCFI as anxiety and mood disorders, meaning  that xe2x80x9cdepressionxe2x80x9d behaves in as trait-like a way as xe2x80x9cinterest in  sciencexe2x80x9d, and vice versa. If you werenxe2x80x99t planning on coming up with some  separate category of xe2x80x9cscience-loversxe2x80x9d and demanding everyone classify  themselves as in it or out of it, you probably shouldnxe2x80x99t do the same  with depression.They also have a category called xe2x80x9cgenderxe2x80x9d. They say they included  measures like xe2x80x9cfemininityxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9csex-stereotyped activitiesxe2x80x9d in there xe2x80x93 I  canxe2x80x99t find more specifics. It has a CCFI of 0.42 with confidence  interval including 0.5, so looks slightly more dimensional, but canxe2x80x99t  quite rule out it being slightly more categorical. If anyone ever  demands you have an opinion on the question xe2x80x9cis binary gender real?xe2x80x9d, I  think the most scientifically-supported answer would be xe2x80x9cit has a  Comparative Curve Fit Index of 0.42 plus or minus 0.1, which means it  trends towards dimensionality but taxonicity cannot be ruled outxe2x80x9d.  Therexe2x80x99s also a xe2x80x9csexualityxe2x80x9d category on here, but itxe2x80x99s such a grab bag of  different things (sexual orientation, how promiscuous you are, etc)  that Ixe2x80x99m not sure you can get much out of it; look at the individual  studies if you want to know more.III.Does this mean that, contra all those public awareness campaigns, xe2x80x9cdepression is just normal sadnessxe2x80x9d or whatever?Ixe2x80x99m not sure clinical depression is even kind of the same sort of thing as sadness. Lots of aspects of depression - like its tendency to occur in episodes lasting on average six months to a year - donxe2x80x99t seem like jacked-up aspects of normal sadness. So maybe this a bad example. But we can probably come up with equally awkward questions about other conditions. Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder just normal anxiety? Is ADHD just normal absent-mindedness?Not necessarily normal. As the old saying goes, quantity has a quality all its own. Just because something is on a continuum with something else, doesnxe2x80x99t mean it has to be close to it.Suppose you make the US median income of $36,000/year. You live in an average American town where you see people of various social strata. Your doctor makes $200,000/year and drives a Tesla. Your sister is a single mother making $20,000/year, and needs food stamps to make ends meet. You probably think you have a good sense of class distinctions.What about Jeff Bezos? Is Bezosxe2x80x99 fortune xe2x80x9cjust normal wealthxe2x80x9d? Taxometrically: yes. Jeff Bezos falls on the same continuum as everyone else. You can add one dollar to your own net worth, and keep doing that, and eventually end up at Jeff Bezosxe2x80x99 net worth. At every point in between - a few hundred thousand, a few million, a few tens of millions - there will be some people at that point. Therexe2x80x99s no clear distinction into two disjoint groups, where youxe2x80x99re in one and Jeff Bezos is in the other.Practically: no. Practically, Jeff Bezos might as well be a different species. If your idea of wealth is a doctor who makes $200,000 a year, youxe2x80x99re totally unprepared to think about Jeff Bezos. Your whole economic world between the poor single mother and the rich doctor occupies one order of magnitude; Jeff Bezos is five orders of magnitude beyond it.In Nassim Talebxe2x80x99s language, Jeff Bezos lives in Extremistan. If youxe2x80x99re expecting a normal distribution, Bezos is way outside of it and looks like a different species. But really hexe2x80x99s just at the tail end of a distribution with much longer tails than you expected.If this is true, I think it's fair to think of severe ADHD as having the same relationship to normal absent-mindedness that Jeff Bezos has a to a guy making a little above median income. Theyxe2x80x99re the same sort of thing on the same distribution. But one is so much further out than our normal vocabulary for talking about these kinds of differences that it's okay to have a different word for it and different intuitions around it.IV.If most mental disorders are dimensional variation rather than taxa, that kind of makes the DSM look pretty silly, doesnxe2x80x99t it?Remember, the DSM is fundamentally a diagnostic guide. Itxe2x80x99s a list of  criteria to determine who has eg depression. To oversimplify just a  little, if a patient has five or more of their depression criteria, then  they xe2x80x9creally havexe2x80x9d depression, and a psychiatrist should diagnose them.  If they only meet four or fewer, they donxe2x80x99t have depression, and should  not get the diagnosis. All of this is predicated on the idea that  therexe2x80x99s a specific thing called depression that you either do or donxe2x80x99t  have.Dimensional variation doesnxe2x80x99t work that way. Letxe2x80x99s return to our wealth analogy. Imagine a manual which let you diagnose someone as xe2x80x9crichxe2x80x9d only if they  meet at least three of the following criteria:1. Owns five or more cars 2. Has a house in a gated community 3. Has an income of $1,000,000 a year or above 4. Takes first-class flights at least three times a year 5. Engages in rich-person activities (horseback-riding, golfing, reading the New Yorker) at least twice a monthxe2x80xa6and then every few years economists get into huge fights about whether maybe we should change this and say you have to own six  or more cars, or whether there should be an exemption for people who  own fewer cars but do have a private jet, and they all take it really  really seriously.The problem isnxe2x80x99t that the criteria are wrong. All of these are  perfectly reasonable characteristics to correlate with richness. The  problem is that your project of dividing the world into xe2x80x9crichxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cnot  richxe2x80x9d is fundamentally not a scientific one, and is more likely to  confuse than to enlighten. Someone with an income of $999,999 isnxe2x80x99t  interestingly different from someone with an income of $1,000,001;  owning four cars blends seamlessly into owning five.This isnxe2x80x99t to say you never want to do something like this. Suppose  Bernie Sanders wants to increase taxes on the rich, but not on everyone  else. He needs some regulation about who the increased taxes hit, and  maybe something like this checklist (or more realistically just the  income cutoff at $1,000,000) is the way to go. Itxe2x80x99s fine if he wants to  set something up like that xe2x80x93 as long as economists donxe2x80x99t look at his  division of people into two bins and mistake it for the discovery of an  underlying cosmic secret that there are two types of people, rich and  non-rich, separated by the $1,000,000-a-year mark. Are psychiatrists mistaking moderately useful bins for underlying  cosmic secrets? Itxe2x80x99s hard for me to tell exactly how many people make  this mistake; the people who understand whatxe2x80x99s going on and are just  using the categories as rules-of-thumb tend to sound a lot like the  people who donxe2x80x99t. My guess is most professionals, and an overwhelming  majority of laymen, are actually confused on this point, and this  messes them up in a lot of ways.An economist or sociologist looking for the causes of wealth or  poverty understands that theyxe2x80x99re doing a pretty complicated thing. In  the complex system that is human economic behavior, they will  probably find that all sorts of factors like upbringing, education,  genetics, health, discrimination, and luck interact to determine how  much money you have. On the other hand, a microbiologist looking for the  cause of the flu will be hoping to find a single specific thing xe2x80x93 one  virus that all flu patients have and all healthy people donxe2x80x99t. I think a  lot of people still want psychiatry to deliver the single specific thing. Itxe2x80x99s not going to be able to do that. If you hold out hope,  youxe2x80x99ll either end up overmedicalizing everything, or youxe2x80x99ll get disillusioned and radicalized and start saying all psychiatry is fake. I  think either would be a mistake.In my practice, Ixe2x80x99ve moved away from asking questions like xe2x80x9cdoes this  patient really have ADHDxe2x80x9d? Those kinds of questions make me feel like  Ixe2x80x99m trying to decode their symptoms to uncover some secret variable that  could be either 0 or 1. But there is no such variable. Instead, I ask  xe2x80x9chow much trouble does this person have with paying attention?xe2x80x9d. This is  usually pretty easy to figure out; the patient will just tell me if I  ask!Likewise, Ixe2x80x99ve moved away from thought processes like xe2x80x9cIf this person  has ADHD, they genuinely need a stimulant; if not, theyxe2x80x99re just  fakingxe2x80x9d. Instead, I try to think of how much the patientxe2x80x99s symptoms are  disabling them, whether a stimulant would relieve some of those  symptoms, how likely the symptoms are to go away without an stimulant,  and, based on all this, whether the benefits of a stimulant outweigh the  risks.(this has another implication: stimulants shouldnxe2x80x99t be thought of as  magic bullets that xe2x80x9ccurexe2x80x9d xe2x80x9cADHDxe2x80x9d by fixing the underlying cause, in the  same way that Tamiflu cures the flu by blocking flu viruses. They should  be thought of as things that affect the underlying stew of variables  that cause ADHD in some helpful way. By comparison, giving someone a  college scholarship might help them become richer, but itxe2x80x99s not xe2x80x9ccuringxe2x80x9d  xe2x80x9cthexe2x80x9d xe2x80x9ccausexe2x80x9d of xe2x80x9cpovertyxe2x80x9d in a way that flips them from a xe2x80x9cnot richxe2x80x9d  to a xe2x80x9crichxe2x80x9d status.)Also, this is why I donxe2x80x99t like the pressure to use  person-centered-language (eg instead of xe2x80x9cautistic personxe2x80x9d, you should  say xe2x80x9cperson with autismxe2x80x9d). This sends exactly the wrong signal. If  autism is dimensional, we should think of it the same way we do height  and wealth xe2x80x93 and we say xe2x80x9ctall personxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9crich personxe2x80x9d. Saying xe2x80x9cperson  with Heightxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cPerson with Richnessxe2x80x9d is strongly suggestive of xe2x80x9cperson  with the fluxe2x80x9d xe2x80x93 it implies a binary class that you either fall into, or  donxe2x80x99t. But thatxe2x80x99s the opposite of what most research suggests, and the  opposite of the thought process that will help you think about these  conditions sensibly.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Ontology Of Psychiatric Conditions: Taxometrics - Astral Codex Ten","url":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions"}

If itxe2x80x99s a bit more of a complex company, stretching your circle of competency spectrum, and isnxe2x80x99t widely covered by analysts and financial news, it may take upwards of 20-40+ hours.The danger to this is the sunk cost fallacy. Too often I see investors spend significant time analyzing a company, then feel they have to invest in it just because theyxe2x80x99ve put in so much time learning about it. Or, because theyxe2x80x99ve put so much time into learning about it, they have a bias when creating their investment thesis, causing them to be overly optimistic about certain things they otherwise wouldnxe2x80x99t be if they were able to think clearly without bias.How do I know this happens? I hear about it all the time from listeners of the podcast, and, I did this myself for a while.This is one of the reasons why investing is so hard. Emotions. Behavioral finance. Psychology. Itxe2x80x99s working against you.You also have the sunk cost fallacy at work.Realize that the time spent analyzing the company is a sunk cost. Whether you invest money in the company or not, youxe2x80x99ve already spent/lost that time xe2x80x94 therexe2x80x99s no getting it back. Does it make the situation any better if you invest in the company, even though you donxe2x80x99t fully believe in it, just because you spent time analyzing it? Does that give you back your time?No.It just causes you to lose time AND MONEY.There are two ways Ixe2x80x99ve learned to combat this.The first is that I invest a few hours (1-3) in learning about a company, then I decide if there is potential. If there is, I will keep researching further. If Ixe2x80x99m not sure or I donxe2x80x99t think there is, I stop there and donxe2x80x99t spend any more time on it. If Ixe2x80x99m not sure and think there might be an opportunity, I might research slightly more, but most likely, I add it to a xe2x80x9cresearch more laterxe2x80x9d list.The second is that Ixe2x80x99ll open an insignificant, immaterial starter position, maybe a few shares (0.1-5, depending on price), just to get some xe2x80x9cskin in the gamexe2x80x9d. Itxe2x80x99s amazing how having even just a little skin in the game can impact your willingness to research. I donxe2x80x99t buy so many shares that it causes me to have a bias to only look into positive things about the company because I own a position, rather I buy just a few shares to get skin in the game, which motivates me to research more.I do a bit of research, then either sell the 1-5 shares I bought if I donxe2x80x99t like what I found, or I buy more if I do like what I found and start building up my position.If you can do the first strategy I mentioned, thatxe2x80x99s usually my preferred method. However, if you need a bit more motivation to do the research, Ixe2x80x99ve been successful with the second strategy as well.If you have any questions youxe2x80x99d like answered, please drop them in the comments below, or simply respond to this email!

This part really caught my eye:Biden has less trust in economists, and so does everyone elsexe2x80xa6Multiple economists, both  inside and outside the Biden administration, told me that this is an  administration in which economists and financiers are simply far less  influential than they were in past administrationsxe2x80xa6The  backdrop for this administration is the failures of the past generation  of economic advice. Fifteen years of financial crises, yawning  inequality and repeated debt panics that never showed up in interest  rates have taken the shine off economic expertise. But the core of this  story is climatexe2x80xa6Economists have their ideas for  solving climate change xe2x80x94 a hefty carbon tax chief among them xe2x80x94 but Biden  and his team see this as fundamentally a political problem. They view  the idea that a carbon tax is the essential answer to the problem of  climate change as being so divorced from political reality as to be  actively dangerous. Itxe2x80x99s interesting to see which branches of econ are gaining clout in Democratic administrations and which are losing clout. On one hand, Bidenxe2x80x99s cash-based welfare programs and big R&D spending come firmly out of economics research. On the other hand, he seems to be paying much less attention to austerity-minded macroeconomists.But as Ezra points out, itxe2x80x99s climate where economists are being utterly ignored, in favor of technologists and activists. And rightly so. I hate to say this, but climate economics has almost completely failed to be useful to the national policy discourse. This isnxe2x80x99t a minor slip-up, either; climate change is one of the most important economic policy issues for the future of the country and the world, and the econ profession has just totally dropped the ball. I wrote a Bloomberg article about this back in 2016, but the situation hasnxe2x80x99t noticeably improved. I can see at least four major ways climate economics has failed. These are:Simply not publishing enough researchPutting out models that are frankly just badIgnoring tail risksObsessively focusing on carbon taxesCriticizing academic economists is tough. They tend to instantly circle the wagons and scoff dismissively at any external critics. And why shouldnxe2x80x99t they? With their tenure and high salaries, they donxe2x80x99t exactly have much of a financial or professional reason to care if some blogger chides them, or even if the President refuses to heed their advice. But there are lots of good people within the profession who have strong consciences, and who donxe2x80x99t like the idea of economics falling into disrepute and losing influence. So I hope criticisms like this reach the ears of people who quietly realize the need to change course.ShareOne big problem with climate economics is that there just isnxe2x80x99t enough of it. Climate change is going to affect every facet of our economy. Quantitatively, itxe2x80x99s vastly more important than any optimal tax calculation or detail of occupational licensing; itxe2x80x99s arguably even more important than the business cycle itself. But the number of papers at top journals dedicated to climate economics is miniscule. In a scathing 2019 article entitled xe2x80x9cWhy are economists letting the world down on climate change?xe2x80x9d, economists Andrew Oswald and Nicholas Stern write:We are sorry to say that we think academic economists are letting down the world.  Economics has contributed disturbingly little to discussions about climate change.  As one example, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, which is currently the most-cited journal in the field of economics, has never published an article on climate changexe2x80xa6We suspect that modern economics is stuck in a kind of Nash equilibrium.  Academic economists are obsessed with publishing per se and with pleasing potential referees.  The reason there are few economists who write climate change articles, we think, is because other economists do not write climate change articles.They include the following table, which shows just how few climate papers the top econ journals have ever published as of 2019:The total is 57, out of a total of approximately 77,000 total articles. So about 0.074%. As Oswald and Stern point out, this is really surprising, since climate change A) is caused by economic activity, B) has huge economic effects, and C) will take smart economic policy to get out of. In fact, though, I think the situation is even worse than their article depicts. Because a fair amount of the climate economics research that does get done is badly flawed. The most egregious strain of climate economics research is the stuff that concludes that climate change is not a problem at all. The chief offender here I know of here is Richard Tol, a professor at the University of Sussex. Tol wrote a famous paper in 2009 in which he argued that global warming would cause economic gains for people living in temperate zones, and that these gains would outweigh the losses to people living in the tropics. His reasoning? Warmer temperatures mean you donxe2x80x99t have to use the heater as much, warm temperatures are better for health, and more CO2 in the atmosphere makes crops grow faster.This is obviously ridiculous, for any number of reasons that a few seconds of thought by anyone even remotely acquainted with the climate change issue can easily point out. First of all, climate change doesnxe2x80x99t just warm everything up gently and evenly; it causes erratic weather, which can include very cold weather (this was widely understood well before Tol wrote his paper). Second, an overwhelming amount of research shows that climate change is bad for agricultural productivity, through a vast array of mechanisms; Tol simply cherry-picked one random paper that claims CO2 makes plants grow faster. Third, there are a ton of effects of climate change that Tol waves away, saying they xe2x80x9cseem likely to be smallxe2x80x9d. The word xe2x80x9cwildfiresxe2x80x9d does not appear in his article. Tol recognizes this problem, writing that xe2x80x9cnegative surprises should be more likely than positive surprisesxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cit is relatively easy to imagine a disaster scenario for climate change,xe2x80x9d and then basically ignores that crucial point. But on top of all this, Tolxe2x80x99s calculations were complete crap. In 2014 he had to publish a correction when it turned out he had omitted some minus signs, causing him to log costs of climate change as benefits (ooops!!). He also made a coding error that dropped some data. Tol blamed xe2x80x9cgremlinsxe2x80x9d for the errors. Andrew Gelman and company found  a whole raft of additional problems with Tolxe2x80x99s data, analysis, and model. In 2015, the journal issued a second round of corrections.This was obviously an incredibly poor showing. But Tolxe2x80x99s shoddy analysis made its way into the public policy conversation. In 2009 he published an op-ed entitled xe2x80x9cWhy worry about climate change?xe2x80x9d. Senate Republicans put him on their list of expert climate change skeptics. As recently as 2013 xe2x80x94 before all the gremlins were discovered xe2x80x94 Tolxe2x80x99s bad research was being used by conservative op-ed writers to argue that climate change is good for the world.So is Tol a lone outlier here? Itxe2x80x99s hard to find research as bad as that 2009 paper, but many of the same basic errors crop up in other climate economics research. For example, in 2011, Michael Greenstone and Olivier Deschenes published a paper about climate change and mortality (I studied an earlier version of this paper in a grad school class). Their approach is to measure the effect of temperature on mortality rates in normal times, and use that estimate to predict how a warmer world would affect mortality. The authors make the obvious and grievous mistake of assuming that climate change affects human mortality only through the direct effects of air temperature xe2x80x94 heatstroke, heart attack, freezing, and so on. The word xe2x80x9cstormxe2x80x9d does not appear in the paper. The word xe2x80x9cfirexe2x80x9d does not appear in the paper. The word xe2x80x9cfloodxe2x80x9d does not appear in the paper. The authors do mention that climate change might increase disease vectors, but wave this away. Near the end of the paper they write that xe2x80x9cit is possible that the incidence of extreme events would increase, and these could affect human healthxe2x80xa6This study is not equipped to shed light on these issues.xe2x80x9dYou donxe2x80x99t say.The big conceptual mistake here is to assume that whatever economists can easily measure is the sum total of whatxe2x80x99s important for the world xe2x80x94 that events for which a reliable cost or benefit cannot be easily guessed should simply be ignored in cost-benefit calculations. That is bad science and bad policy advice.Greenstone and Deschenes also published a paper in the prestigious American Economic Review in 2007 in which they conclude that global warming will increase crop yields. This conclusion is very different from what most researchers find, including other climate economists. Economists Anthony Fisher, Michael Hanemann, and Michael James Roberts published a comment in 2012. They write:In a series of studies employing a variety of approaches, we have found that the potential impact of climate change on US agriculture is likely negative. Deschxc3xaanes and Greenstone (2007) report dramatically different results based on regressions of agricultural profits and yields on weather variables. The divergence is explained by (1) missing and incorrect weather and climate data in their study; (2) their use of older climate change projections rather than the more recent and less optimistic projections from the Fourth Assessment Report; and (3) difficulties in their profit measure due to the confounding effects of storage.  Michael Greenstone, a professor at the University of Chicago, is a very important and influential climate economist! He helped lead the Obama administration team tasked with calculating a numerical value for the xe2x80x9csocial cost of carbonxe2x80x9d. When important, leading researchers put out papers ignoring the biggest dangers from climate change and producing highly unusual results with potential data errors, we should be worried. Why is this bad climate economics research getting published? Many people will be quick to allege that itxe2x80x99s politics xe2x80x94 conservative economists who believe that anxiety over climate change is an excuse to destroy capitalism, and who are thus biased towards doing research that minimizes the potential harm of climate change. I donxe2x80x99t know how much of that is going on, but I think there are also other potential reasons. One is the streetlight effect xe2x80x94 economists are very focused on what they can measure, and tend to disregard what they canxe2x80x99t measure. A second is siloing xe2x80x94 economists are not the type to go call up climate scientists to collaborate on a paper. If you look at the references in one of Deschenes and Greenstonexe2x80x99s papers, you see very few citations of actual climate science papers; instead, itxe2x80x99s mostly just a bunch of econ papers. Youxe2x80x99d think that collaboration with the scientists who study the actual physical process of climate change and its associated effects on weather, crops, and so on would seem to be crucial for assessing the economic impact of climate changexe2x80xa6right?In any case, my suspicion is that this sort of research contributes to the growing conviction that climate economists are not experts to be relied upon.If there is one climate economist who is respected above all others, itxe2x80x99s William Nordhaus of Yale, who won the Econ Nobel in 2018 xe2x80x9cfor integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis.xe2x80x9d The prize specifically cited Nordhausxe2x80x99 creation of an xe2x80x9cintegrated assessment modelxe2x80x9d for analyzing the costs of climate change. The most famous of these is the DICE Model, used by the Environmental Protection Agency. But the DICE Model, or at least the version wexe2x80x99ve been using for years, is obviously bananas. As climate writer David Roberts noted in 2018, according to the standard version of Nordhausxe2x80x99 model, the economic cost of a 6xc2xb0C increase in global temperatures would only be 10% of GDP. As Roberts notes, climate scientists believe that that level of temperature increase would make the Earth basically unlivable. An unlivable Earth is going to cost a lot more than 10% of GDP. Nordhausxe2x80x99 models recommend a ceiling of of 3.5xc2xb0C, which is higher than what the world is on track for at the end of the century if we donxe2x80x99t make any further changes; in other words, a Nobel-winning climate economics model recommends that the economic cost of doing anything more than wexe2x80x99re already doing to stop climate change is too high. Thatxe2x80x99s obviously bananapants, so letxe2x80x99s go through and discuss a couple obvious problems with the model.One obvious problem with DICE models, or at least with the numbers Nordhaus plugged into his DICE models, is that they assume a high discount rate. The discount rate is the degree to which we donxe2x80x99t care about the future xe2x80x94 the higher the discount rate, the more we disregard what happens in 20 or 50 years. DICE models get their discount rate from interest rates, which represent how much the investors who are currently alive and investing in the market care about the future. If investorsxe2x80x99 bond purchases donxe2x80x99t reflect concerns about whether their great-grandchildren live in an infernal hellscape, DICE doesnxe2x80x99t care about it either. It turns out that most economists think that this isnxe2x80x99t a good way to select discount rates. In 2016, David Roberts reported the results of a survey of economists who mostly supported using a lower discount rate than the market rate, based on ethical concerns about the future of humanity:This is obviously the right thing to do, and economists know it, yet somehow the most popular climate model for years was one that ignored the welfare of future generations. A second reason DICE models are broken is that they assume that stopping climate change will be very expensive. Nordhausxe2x80x99 formulation basically ignores the fact that renewable energy technologies have been getting cheaper at a stupendous rate for decades, which reduces the cost of decarbonization. Once more I must post this graph:In other words, DICE models basically assume that we face a grim choice between impoverishing ourselves today or forcing our descendants to endure a hellscape future xe2x80x94 and having tricked themselves into believing this, they choose to save the economy rather than the future of humanity. But thanks to technological progress, this grim choice is no longer nearly so grim. In addition to all of this, the DICE models probably get the climate science wrong. In 2020, a group of climate scientists writing in Nature Climate Change concluded:Under the UN Paris Agreement, countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2xe2x80x89xc2xb0C and to actively pursue a 1.5xe2x80x89xc2xb0C limit. Yet, according to the 2018 Economics Nobel laureate William Nordhaus, these targets are economically suboptimal or unattainable and the world community should aim for 3.5xe2x80x89xc2xb0C in 2100 instead. Here, we show that the UN climate targets may be optimal even in the Dynamic Integrated Climatexe2x80x93Economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, when appropriately updated. Changes to DICE include more accurate calibration of the carbon cycle and energy balance model, and updated climate damage estimates.   A team of economists looked closely at the science and reached the same conclusion. Put more reasonable costs and discount rates into a DICE model, and it gives us a target closer to 2xc2xb0C xe2x80x94 exactly what climate scientists have been recommending. But on top of all this, therexe2x80x99s one other huge weakness of the DICE model xe2x80x94 it focuses on the most likely scenario, and ignores tail risks. As Richard Tol wrote, xe2x80x9cnegative surprises should be more likely than positive surprisesxe2x80x9d when it comes to climate change, and xe2x80x9cit is relatively easy to imagine a disaster scenario for climate change.xe2x80x9d The possibility of very bad effects of climate change that we canxe2x80x99t predict should make us more anxious to avoid it. Some of these are things we can imagine but which we think have only a small probability, like xe2x80x9ctipping pointsxe2x80x9d beyond which climate change becomes self-sustaining. And others are things we donxe2x80x99t even consider before we wake up and find them happening to us. In September 2020, Oregonians woke up and found this happening to their world:September 11th 2020Lots of people moved to California for the weather. If wildfires, driven by climate change, make the state unlivable, that will be an economic cost not imagined by William Nordhaus models. What other things did Nordhaus fail to imagine?There was one famous economist who did imagine these things. Martin Weitzman wrote a paper in 2009 called xe2x80x9cOn modeling and interpreting the economics of catastrophic climate changexe2x80x9d. The math is complex, but the upshot is simple and easy to understand: If therexe2x80x99s the possibility of utter catastrophe, standard cost-benefit analysis doesnxe2x80x99t make a whole lot of sense. Weitzman wrote: Perhaps in the end the climate-change economist can help most by not presenting a cost-benefit estimate for what is inherently a fat-tailed situation with potentially unlimited downside exposure as if it is accurate and objectivexe2x80xa6the artificial crispness conveyed by conventional [DICE-type cost-benefit analyses] here is especially and unusually misleading compared with more ordinary non-climate-change CBA situations.Weitzman tried to warn us. Instead, despite widespread expectations he would share the Nobel with Nordhaus, he was snubbed xe2x80x94 one of the prize committeexe2x80x99s most grievous errors, in my opinion.On top of all these problems with climate economics research, the main policy that climate economists recommend is utterly inadequate to the task of dealing with climate change. Ixe2x80x99m talking about carbon taxes. Economists LOVE carbon taxes. Voters seem not to. In 2016, economist Yoram Bauman xe2x80x94 best known for doing inside-baseball stand-up comedy about the economics profession (a show I once participated in!) xe2x80x94 launched a campaign to create a revenue-neutral carbon tax in the state of Washington. Despite basically every economist in the world gushing over it, it failed 59.3% to 40.7%. It met stiff opposition from the political left and didnxe2x80x99t get much support on the political right either. Greg Mankiw created the Pigou Club, which in his words was xe2x80x9can elite group of economists and pundits with the good sense to have publicly advocatedxe2x80xa6carbon taxes.xe2x80x9d This elite group has accomplished just about as much as you might expect. A second Washington State effort, designed to be more amenable to the left, went down to defeat in 2018. In 2019, some economists studied these failures and tried to figure out why voters, despite liking a carbon tax in polls, voted it down at the voting booth. They found that ideological opposition and pressure from special interest groups was a factor, but they also found that people were simply averse to paying higher energy prices. This isnxe2x80x99t just politics; economists have forgotten basic Econ 101. Voters instinctively know what economists, for some mystifying reason, have seemed to ignore xe2x80x94 the people who pay the costs of a carbon tax donxe2x80x99t reap the benefits. Carbon taxes are enacted locally, but climate change is a global phenomenon. That means that if Washington state taxes carbon, its own residents pay, but most of the benefit is reaped by people in other countries and other states. Thus, jurisdictions that choose not to enact carbon taxes can simply hope that someone else shoulders the cost of combating climate change. So no one ends up paying the cost.Thatxe2x80x99s called the free rider problem, and itxe2x80x99s one of the most basic forms of market failure. When economists urge nations and states to tax carbon, they are hoping that altruism will overcome the free rider problem. It generally does not. Only a few countries around the world have put a price on carbon.The free-rider problem is especially acute for rapidly growing poor countries. These countries now produce the lionxe2x80x99s share of the worldxe2x80x99s carbon emissions, and that share is only going to grow:If warming is to be held to 2xc2xb0C, it is these countries that must do the lionxe2x80x99s share of the decarbonization. If doing this means their economies will no longer be able to grow enough to lift their people out of poverty, they will not do it. No matter how many economists flap their elbows and screech xe2x80x9cPut a price on carbon!!xe2x80x9d, China and the other countries of Asia will simply not limit their growth to an appreciable degree. They refused to do it at the Paris climate talks and they will continue to refuse. Carbon tariffs, carbon clubs, and other rich-country incentives will not be sufficient to persuade them. As Bidenxe2x80x99s economic advisors recognize, the only way China et al. will decarbonize is if doing so does not substantially hurt their economies. Thus, the whole framework that economists use for thinking about climate change xe2x80x94 a big fat tradeoff between roasting the planet and tanking the economy xe2x80x94 just wonxe2x80x99t work here. Fortunately, there is a second market failure at work here xe2x80x94 one that can be leveraged to fight climate change without a severe tradeoff between the economy and the environment. It is one that economists, in their zeal to promote their darling carbon tax, have almost completely ignored. It is the positive externality of technology.Ramez Naam, a technologist who has been remarkably prescient about green energy, has a great thread about how focusing on improving green technology creates less of an economic tradeoff than focusing on reducing demand for fossil fuels via a carbon tax. Here are a few tweets from that thread:Andrew McAfee @amcafeeFebruary 9th 2019February 9th 2019February 9th 2019February 9th 2019Do read the whole thing. As Ramez notes, carbon taxes are good policy. Theyxe2x80x99re just limited policy. Economists have been so monomaniacally focused on how econ-y the carbon tax is that theyxe2x80x99ve failed to consider alternatives that are more cost-effective and politically feasible. Thatxe2x80x99s why the technologists like Ramez and the activists of the Green New Deal have gotten this one right, and the economists have been left out in the cold. And itxe2x80x99s probably a big part of why the Biden administration is listening to the technologists and the activists instead of to the economists. From this litany of failures, I would suggest the following steps for climate economics to make itself more relevant:Publish more climate economics papers.Push back harder against shoddy methods.Reevaluate the DICE Model.Think more about tail risks.Start thinking a lot more about technology.Start thinking a lot more about the international aspect of decarbonization.Stop focusing so much on carbon taxes.I do believe that economists still have time to have an important, positive impact on climate policy. But the failures of the past cannot be allowed to persist into the future. Itxe2x80x99s time for a course correction.Update: As expected, a number of climate economists popped up on Twitter to remind me that lots of good climate econ research is, in fact, getting done. Itxe2x80x99s often getting done by younger and/or less famous people, it tends not to be published in top econ journals (or, sometimes, in econ journals at all!), and itxe2x80x99s mostly fairly recent stuff (within the last decade, and especially within the last half-decade). This is absolutely true. And these people generally know what needs to be done to improve the field. But xe2x80x94 just as with macroeconomics after 2008 xe2x80x94 I think it will take a long time before the new crop of climate economists dig the field out of the hole of reduced credibility and prestige that it dug from the 90s through the early 2010s. Old guys who were writing papers about how climate change is good for agriculture 15 or 20 years ago are still in positions of prominence and authority. Climate change minimizers are still citing the old papers. The top econ journals are still not publishing many climate papers. Most public policy advocacy still seems quite focused on the carbon tax. Nordhausxe2x80x99 Nobel (and Weitzmanxe2x80x99s lack of Nobel) was just three years ago. There are good people working very hard on turning the ship around, but these ships tend to turn very slowly.

In our current political climate, could it be that good economic research would continue to show that warmer temperatures don't hurt much, or even help, and that anyone who publishes in that area is treading in a minefield and would get cancelled? Going against the religiously held principles of the Establishment is something professors are reluctant to do.  This very essay of yours shows why economists are reluctant to write articles on whether the US would be better off  if Chicago's climate were more like Atlanta's.

Ixe2x80x99ve ridden on the shinkansen, the TGV, and the Shanghai maglev, and they were all great. Itxe2x80x99s super convenient to be able to travel from Tokyo to Osaka xe2x80x94 about the same distance as SF to L.A. xe2x80x94 in 2.5 hours, then step off the train and be right in the middle of a central subway station. Ixe2x80x99m also well aware of the potential climate benefits of high-speed rail relative to airplanes and cars. But that still leaves me with tons of questions about the recent enthusiasm for a huge new network of high-speed trains in the U.S. Among many young people on Twitter, this zeal has reached an almost ecstatic pitch. Tweets of a famous 2013 proposal for a high-speed rail system by urbanist Alfred Twu (whom you should definitely follow on Twitter, by the way) regularly get thousands or tens of thousands of retweets:Vox wrote an article about the virality of this map, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg tweeted that article out, saying xe2x80x9cGen Z is dreaming big. It's time we all did the same.xe2x80x9dSoon, other people were tweeting out their own ambitious HSR maps. Herexe2x80x99s one by transit researcher Alon Levy that also got a lot of attention:Other people and organizations have been quick to make alternative, equally ambitious maps. Amtrak even released its own, though it included more than just high speed rail. Here was the most entertaining one (though certainly the least serious):Twuxe2x80x99s, however, remains the most famous.I donxe2x80x99t want this to sound like a cranky anti-HSR rant, because I would seriously love to have the kind of train transportation in this country that I enjoy every time I go to other rich nations. Itxe2x80x99s just that I have lots of questions about these maps and this whole effort. I wonder whether a big nationwide high-speed train network like this is the right transportation priority for the U.S. right now, and whether itxe2x80x99s even feasible. ShareThe best thing about using the shinkansen in Japan is that you can get to and from the high-speed rail station using a dense, convenient network of local trains. In America there is no such network. Thus, when I imagine taking the train from SF to L.A., I imagine taking a scooter or an Uber to and from the strain station. In L.A., which is so spread out that I probably wonxe2x80x99t stay in a small area, I imagine Ixe2x80x99d rent a car. Thatxe2x80x99s a very different experience from using the shinkansen in Japan. And in NYC, it would mean dealing with the nightmare that is Penn Station xe2x80x94 a thoroughly stressful and inconvenient experience.Building high-speed rail without having a usable network of local trains instinctively feels like putting the cart before the horse. If I had a choice between being able to train around San Francisco conveniently, or quickly get between SF and San Jose, Ixe2x80x99d choose either of those over being able to take a shinkansen-style train to L.A. or Seattle. The lack of local trains and fast commuter rail simply limits my travel options much more than the lack of high-speed rail. A local train network without HSR is great; HSR lines without local trains seem like something thatxe2x80x99s at best slightly better than what we have now. And yes, I realize that money earmarked for xe2x80x9chigh-speed railxe2x80x9d sometimes goes to create faster commuter rail, and thatxe2x80x99s good. But that doesnxe2x80x99t answer the question of what these maps are for.Maybe part of the romance of these maps is that they look like theyxe2x80x99re connecting the country closer together. If you draw a map where the only lines are train lines, then the places with no connections look like theyxe2x80x99re isolated from the rest of the nation. Perhaps that visual impression of unity appeals to people who feel like our country is too disconnected from itself. But in fact the country isnxe2x80x99t disconnected. A dense network of freeways and air transit routes already connects American cities. A round trip between SF and L.A. costs a little over $100. A flight between the two costs maybe $100 to $150. A round trip between Osaka and Tokyo (a slightly shorter distance) costs over $200. In other words, intercity travel is actually slightly cheaper in America than in a country with excellent high speed rail. If people expect a high-speed train ticket to cost xe2x80x9ca little more than a local train ticketxe2x80x9d, rather than xe2x80x9ca little more than an airplane ticketxe2x80x9d, they need to look at some actual prices.This is not to say that HSR has no benefits over cars and airplanes; the benefits come in terms of convenience and climate impact rather than actual cost. But the point here is that our nation is already very xe2x80x9cwired upxe2x80x9d in terms of how easy it is to get back and forth between cities. People in Tampa are not trapped in Tampa. In fact, therexe2x80x99s one way that HSR might make us less geographically connected. Freeways look like lines on a map, but in fact those lines are highly porous xe2x80x94 there are highway exits every few miles. Those exits sustain a vast number of small towns; people driving on the highway get off to get gas or eat or do a little tourism and look around. This distributes economic activity across the U.S. countryside. HSR, in contrast, is a point-to-point connection xe2x80x94 you get on at the start and get off at the end, and you donxe2x80x99t stop off in between. That means rural areas and small towns that benefit economically from freeway traffic will suffer from being bypassed by HSR, just as they suffer from toll roads or short-hop air travel. (Update: Here is some evidence that this actually does happen in Japan.)High-speed trains are mostly not usable for daily commutes. Instead, theyxe2x80x99re used mainly by business travelers, vacationers, and tourists.But business travel has an uncertain future. In the age of Zoom, itxe2x80x99s infinitely cheaper to simply have a free video chat with the L.A. office rather than paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars to send a corporate representative down there to meet in person. This is a good thing, since it makes our economy much more productive. But it poses a threat to traditional modes of transportation, like airlines. And that means it poses a threat to the economic viability of a future high-speed rail network as well.The potential decline of business travel calls into question the entire economic benefit of HSR. Yes, making it easier for businesspeople to travel between production locations is a boost to productivity. But Zoom might simply supersede those gains by providing a much bigger boost. Making it slightly more convenient to talk face to face with a coworker, supplier, or customer in another city is good. Making it infinitely cheaper and much more convenient is better, and eliminates much of the scope for gains from trains.Of course that leaves vacations and tourism. Foreigners coming in and riding the high-speed trains around would be a boon to our GDP. But how much does leisure travel within the U.S. boost overall U.S. economic activity? If you donxe2x80x99t go spend your money in Los Angeles, youxe2x80x99ll spend it in San Francisco. Within-country vacations can help individual regions, but itxe2x80x99s hard to see how it provides a net benefit to the country as a whole.So this leaves me questioning how much of an economic boost HSR will actually give us.All American infrastructure, including highways and housing, costs way too much to build and maintain; this is a severe, systemic, and ongoing problem that we need to fix if wexe2x80x99re going to continue to consider ourselves a developed nation. So Ixe2x80x99m not going to say xe2x80x9cHSR costs too much, hence we canxe2x80x99t do it!xe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 everything costs too much in America. But HSR has so far turned out to be a boondoggle far beyond the standard boondoggle of American highways and transit and housing. When Californiaxe2x80x99s high-speed train from SF to L.A. was announced in 2008, it was projected to cost $33 billion; that cost has now tripled to $100 billion, and itxe2x80x99s likely to go up by more ($8 billion has already been spent). But the far bigger problem is that the train has not actually been built; in 2019, Governor Newsom announced that instead of a shinkansen-type train linking the two biggest metropolitan areas in the state, what was actually getting built was simply a slightly improved train between Merced and Bakersfield, two small cities that people outside of California have likely barely even heard of. Itxe2x80x99s not clear if or when the dreamed-of line will actually be built. More generally, although much of Obamaxe2x80x99s train funding went to improve local train service (great!!), the ambitious plan didnxe2x80x99t result in the U.S. getting any actual true high-speed trains, anywhere.Cost is kind of a side issue when nothing actually gets built for any price.Why is America so awful at building high-speed rail? Back in 2014, Yonah Freemark made an argument that lack of federal willpower is the main thing holding back HSR. That may be true in the general, hypothetical sense that if a government wants to do something badly enough it will get done. But in the specific case of the U.S., there seem to be other problems. The general plagues of NIMBYism and inefficient contracting that afflict all of Americaxe2x80x99s construction efforts seem to be far more of an impediment when it comes to high speed rail, thanks to the all-or-nothing nature of each major line. Roads and local trains can be rerouted to avoid NIMBYs, but high-speed trains really canxe2x80x99t. And when construction is scaled back on roads because of cost bloat you get a little less road, but with HSR you get no train at all. Compounding this problem is the fact that the U.S. doesnxe2x80x99t actually have any experience in building HSR, and is starting from scratch.This is not to say that HSR is doomed or impossible in the U.S. But the people sharing the big shiny maps, including Transportation Secretary Buttigieg, need to be far more serious and concrete about how their plans can succeed when similar plans have utterly failed in the recent past. Given all of these big questions surrounding HSR xe2x80x94 the uncertain benefits, the uncertain ridership, and the uncertain feasibility of construction xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s worth asking one more question. Are these maps actually calls for monument-building? To the Big Train dreamers, is the size of the dream whatxe2x80x99s actually important? Is the primary purpose of HSR to prove that our government can do Big Impressive Things xe2x80x94 or that activist movements can pressure our government into doing Big Impressive Things xe2x80x94rather than to effect material improvements in the economic life of the country?This is sort of the impression I get from talking to Big Train dreamers on Twitter:April 10th 2021April 10th 2021Going to the moon was a form of monument-building, and a very effective one in terms of inspiration and national pride etc. But going to the moon was something that had never been done before; with high-speed rail, the best monument we can hope to build is a system thatxe2x80x99s somewhat slower and crappier than Chinaxe2x80x99s. What sort of glorious monument is that?Surely, if we want to show that our country can do Great Things, there are things we could build that actually play to our national strengths instead of our national weaknesses? The Ike Dike, perhaps, or an orbital defense grid to detect and deflect incoming asteroids? Anyway, I donxe2x80x99t want this post to be a denunciation of high-speed rail, or a declaration that itxe2x80x99ll never work. I love the shinkansen, and I also dream of the day when America can switch from being a car-centric nation to a train-centric nation. But there are just a lot of questions that HSR advocates need to answer. Drawing pretty lines on pretty maps is fun, but we have plenty of those now, and itxe2x80x99s time to get down to brass tacks.(Update: Alon Levy answers my first question. Ixe2x80x99m not entirely satisfied with the answer; I think his models could stand to incorporate a demand model like a random utility model or machine learning model to predict how much people would actually ride HSR to the centers of very spread-out cities. But I understand thatxe2x80x99s a pretty steep ask. Anyway, he does agree that some cities, like L.A., are not very convenient to ride a train to.)ShareFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.When I take the train, I'm so confused why it's more expensive than air travel. On a per kg basis, it seems like air travel should be way more expensive than train travel since propelling something along a track is way less energy-intensive than holding the same thing floating in the air. So what it is that makes trains so expensive to operate?The Metrorail system in Miami was met with the same white elephant boondoggle criticisms when it was built in the mid 1980sIt connects 4 or 5 separate communities in the Miami-Dade area over about 30 miles of track with stations every 2 miles or so. It has become a critical element of transportation infrastructure Most of it is on raised tracks and the open space beneath was mostly useless until recently. Now there are playgrounds, walking/jogging/biking paths and small sitting gardens. People use themItxe2x80x99s recently been connected to MIA and talk about connecting to Miami Beach spark up from time to timePerhaps the HSR proposals should seek similarly less ambitious goals. Instead of connecting 1000s of miles across many states the proposals should seek to connect several metro areas across a few 100 miles (like Miami/Tampa/Orlando) a timeThese lower scale projects are easier to judge costs/benefits and lower risk interns of capital investment. Such projects still offer a transportation option that is unique & of a different quality, kind & scale than the current alternativesNo posts","title":"I don't get the high-speed rail thing (yet) - Noahpinion","url":"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/i-dont-get-the-high-speed-rail-thing"}

At some point, people on 4chan started using it as a term for xe2x80x9cwannabe Japanesexe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 i.e., non-Japanese people who idolize Japanese culture. The phenomenon of idolizing Japanese culture is not new. Richard Brautigan, my favorite poet, ended a book of poems about his visit to that country with the following stanza:June 30th againabove the Pacificacross the international date lineheading home to Americawith part of my heart     in Japan  I know that feeling very well.But while some people refer to anyone who loves Japan as a xe2x80x9cweebxe2x80x9d, the connotation of the term is usually more specific. It generally means someone who loves Japanese pop culture xe2x80x94 cartoons, comics, video games, music, costumes, and so on. Cartoons above all; itxe2x80x99s hard to imagine a weeb who isnxe2x80x99t a fan of anime.(xe2x80x9cWeebxe2x80x9d has largely come to replace the term xe2x80x9cotakuxe2x80x9d in this context. xe2x80x9cOtakuxe2x80x9d is a Japanese word meaning xe2x80x9cgeekxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 a startlingly direct translation actually, right down to the mid-00s shift from a negative to a positive connotation. For years Americans referred to anime fans as xe2x80x9cotakuxe2x80x9d, but the fact that the word had a different meaning in Japan eventually forced a switch, and so xe2x80x9cweebxe2x80x9d it became.)But in fact, xe2x80x9cweebxe2x80x9d has a more complex connotation that goes far beyond Japanophilia or anime fandom. Itxe2x80x99s an entire subculture xe2x80x94 an extremely complex, intricate, unique, and in my opinion beautiful subculture. My contact with that subculture has been extensive enough for me to realize that Ixe2x80x99m not a weeb, and will never really be one xe2x80x94 just like you can go to punk rock shows and realize youxe2x80x99ll never really be a punk. Itxe2x80x99s more than just the fact that I donxe2x80x99t watch a lot of anime, or like most of the mainstream offerings. Itxe2x80x99s that my own relationship to Japan will always be very different from that of weebs. And yet despite the fact that Ixe2x80x99ll never really be a part of  weeb culture, I want to understand it, to theorize it, to bring a taste of its beauty to the wider world. This is a crucial point. You canxe2x80x99t understand weeb culture without understanding how much of a meeting point it is for Americans of all different backgrounds xe2x80x94 and for people of other countries too.A common misconception is that most weebs are White (or even that the word implies whiteness by definition). In fact, though I canxe2x80x99t find statistics, my personal experience suggests that weebs are disproportionately Asian, and have a strong Black and Hispanic contingent as well. A quick internet search will reveal that many nonwhite people self-identify as weebs, often enthusiastically so:This is not to say there arenxe2x80x99t systematic differences between the ways that White people, Black people, and Asian people experience weeb culture. There certainly are. For a taste of the Black weeb perspective, I recommend these 2015 Vice interviews with Black anime fans, and this blog post by Stephanie Pichardo. These interviews confirm my personal impression that weeb culture is generally an extremely welcoming and tolerant space, though as with any subculture these days there will always be a few online trolls. There has been some attempt to litigate the question of whether non-Japanese Asian people can be described as weebs (xe2x80x9cYouxe2x80x99re Asian, so liking Asian stuff isnxe2x80x99t weird and differentxe2x80x9d, etc. etc.). But as so often happens, the steamroller of self-identification has simply rolled right over this discourse; many Asian people do in fact describe themselves as weebs, so weebs they are. Again, the experience of Asian weebs is going to differ in some systematic ways from that of White or Black weebs, but thatxe2x80x99s going to be true of any subculture.It makes intuitive sense that fandom of Japanese pop culture would be something that would bring together Americans of all races. Japan exists outside the traditional Black-White binary of American race relations, and to some extent outside of all American race relations. Itxe2x80x99s an advanced civilization not built by European colonialism, so paying homage to its cultural products xe2x80x94 especially its modern-day fantasies xe2x80x94 has little valence in terms of the racial history and politics of Western nations. (For Asian countries itxe2x80x99s a little more complex, given Japanxe2x80x99s own colonial history in the early 20th century.) In other words, to some extent, weeb culture provides a neutral gathering place where Americans can escape the bruising, grinding social conflicts that comprise our daily reality, and just be human beings who enjoy some cool fantasy stuff.I should also say something about the stereotype that weebs are rightists: This is completely ignorant and wrong. The stereotype exists due to Gamergatexe2x80x99s heavy use of anime avatars back in the mid-2010s, before the alt-right abandoned those for frogs and old Greek statues and pictures of Trump. In fact, there is a small contingent of anime Nazis, just as there was a small contingent of Nazi punks back in the day. But theyxe2x80x99re pretty much all online; you wonxe2x80x99t meet them in real life, at an anime or cosplay convention or other weeb space (or if you do, I guess, you wonxe2x80x99t know, since theyxe2x80x99ll keep their damn mouths shut). In person, weebs will mostly be a mix of libs and leftists, with a few libertarians and conservatives thrown in xe2x80x94 basically a cross-section of American youth.As usual, this is probably best explained with a meme:Weebness is also a somewhat international phenomenon; Japanese pop culture has reached all over the globe, and produced similar reactions in many countries. The subculture is extremely popular in Indonesia (where itxe2x80x99s spelled xe2x80x9cwibuxe2x80x9d), Taiwan, and various other Asian countries. Anime fandom is huge in Italy, France, and Latin America. Again, the weeb cultures of various countries arenxe2x80x99t identical, just as punk culture isnxe2x80x99t the same in different countries. But itxe2x80x99s recognizably similar.The one thing weeb culture isnxe2x80x99t, of course, is Japanese. Itxe2x80x99s derived from Japanese products, so of course itxe2x80x99s inevitably influenced by Japan in a bunch of subtle ways. And most weebs are interested in Japan in some way, shape or form. Some learn Japanese. Others take trips (pilgrimages?) there. In my experience, though, relatively few weebs move to Japan. Why not? The reason, I think, ties in to my general theory about the appeal of weeb culture. In fact, Ixe2x80x99d been wanting to write this post for a long time, but what finally made me sit down and do it was a meme I saw the other day:April 3rd 2021It reminded me of my theory that weeb culture is, in some way, about reclaiming romance that people missed out on. Now, this theory is just something I thought up. Itxe2x80x99s ethnographic, itxe2x80x99s not based on data; I canxe2x80x99t show you any charts proving that This Is Why weebs are weebs. In fact, if you interviewed weebs themselves, I think only a few would get at this idea, and only obliquely. So take it with a few grains of salt; maybe a whole shaker full.But anyway. One thing you immediately notice about weeb culture is how romantic it is. Not sexual, per se; therexe2x80x99s a difference. If you look at the art weebs draw xe2x80x94 whether stuff on sale at conventions or their own doodles on their Instagram pages xe2x80x94 there will be a lot of scenes of young lovers holding each other tenderly, girls gazing up at the moon, young men brooding, and so on. This has nothing to do with the raw, exaggerated, pornographic sexuality of hentai. Itxe2x80x99s the dream of young romance. Romance, as I see it, is about self-image and the narrative of onexe2x80x99s own life. Sex is part of it, but itxe2x80x99s more about feeling sexually desirable than about the actual attainment of pleasure. Love is part of romance too, but itxe2x80x99s less about the emotional relationship itself, and more about the narrative of how you come to love someone xe2x80x94 and being a person worthy of love.And those are experiences that many Americans feel were denied to them in their teenage years. Part of that is just because actual teen love usually isnxe2x80x99t anything like the idealized version xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s awkward, furtive, guilt-ridden, emotionally immature, and driven largely by worries about social approval combined with hunger for sexual experience. But part of it is specific to America xe2x80x94 wexe2x80x99re the most violent rich country in the world, and that violence extends to our junior highs and high schools. American youths use violence to police the boundaries of sexuality and romance; the bullies who kick your ass will also tell you that you donxe2x80x99t deserve a girlfriend or boyfriend. And that violence is deployed especially against people who are generally marginalized xe2x80x94 gay kids, trans kids, racial minorities, disabled kids, kids on the autism spectrum, kids who arenxe2x80x99t conventionally attractive, or kids who are just shy or physically weak or nerdy or weird in some bespoke way we donxe2x80x99t have a name for. If you hang out with weebs, it wonxe2x80x99t take long to realize how many are drawn from those populations.As you graduate high school and get out on your own, of course, America gets a lot better. But lots of Americans are left with a feeling that they missed out on something crucial xe2x80x94 the chance to be a romantic, desirable young person. Japan, to many Americans, feels like a place where people donxe2x80x99t miss out on teen romance. A little of that is probably real. Japan is the least violent rich country in the world, and though it has its share of bullying, ostracism, and social exclusion, they generally donxe2x80x99t take the form of a punch in the head. And the stereotype that Japan is less uptight about sexuality, while mostly false, is not entirely false. These things do make it a little easier to be shy and still have a love life.But mostly that perception of Japan is an illusion xe2x80x94 when they watch anime, Americans are actually consuming the wish-fulfillment fantasies of Japanese creators. The real Japan might not be a place where even dorks and nerds and marginalized people always get to feel desirable and deserving of love, but anime is such a place. If youxe2x80x99re from Japan, you know youxe2x80x99re watching a fantasy, but if youxe2x80x99re from somewhere else, maybe the world of anime romance feels like a place you could really go. And herexe2x80x99s the thing: It sort of is. But that place is not Japan; itxe2x80x99s weeb culture itself.To wax preachy for a moment, the key fact about young love is that you didnxe2x80x99t really miss out, because while the high school years may be the time you want romance the most, theyxe2x80x99re almost certainly not the best time to actually have it. As an adult you get to live on your own, do your own thing, be who you want to be. Thatxe2x80x99s just a lot more conducive to romance.And weeb culture is one of the spaces where adults get a chance to live that romantic life. There are many reasons for this. Yes, one is that weebs, or at least the type who go meet up with other weebs in real life, tend to hook up a lot (thatxe2x80x99s the question you really wanted to ask, right?). But thatxe2x80x99s only a minor piece of it.Another piece is that weeb culture is an extremely gentle, nonviolent culture. Youxe2x80x99ll see fights at punk shows, but Ixe2x80x99ve never even heard of a fight at an anime convention; a polite but heated argument is about all youxe2x80x99ll get. On top of that, weeb culture tends to be fairly welcoming and non-judgmental, as I mentioned above.On top of that, therexe2x80x99s the fact that fandoms offer people the opportunity to develop a personality xe2x80x94 to define themselves by finding stuff that they like. A strong sense of individuality is an essential input into romance; once you know who you are, it becomes a lot easier to believe that someone else could fall in love with you. Things like cosplay also give weebs a chance to express their individuality (while also giving many an excuse to dress up in sexy outfits). But a big reason weeb culture is romantic is simply that anime and other Japanese pop culture gets everybody thinking about romance. Itxe2x80x99s just the motif.Perhaps this is why Japanese people themselves tend to be somewhat mystified when they encounter weebs. Itxe2x80x99s a very odd thing to have your countryxe2x80x99s pop culture used as a platform for a bunch of foreigners to create a real-world facsimile of a romantic youth they imagine you got to enjoy. And perhaps this is why weebs donxe2x80x99t often move to Japan (and those who do often find it unsatisfying); for most, itxe2x80x99s not the place they really want to go.Because Japan isnxe2x80x99t actually the place that lets weebs xe2x80x94 or at least, the ones who arenxe2x80x99t too shy to leave their rooms xe2x80x94 live the romantic dream. That place is weeb culture itself. America and other countries where the culture has taken root didnxe2x80x99t ape Japan; they created something entirely original.Weebs, as a group, are slightly marginalized and resisted by the rest of American culture. xe2x80x9cWeebxe2x80x9d is slowly shedding its negative connotation, but itxe2x80x99s still a mildly derogatory term, associated (entirely unfairly) with hentai pornography, deviant sexuality, right-wing politics, and various other taboo things. Cartoons and cosplay are themselves are still seen by some as a childish pastime or a form of escapism. Much of this, of course, is a cover for the general American tendency to try to seek out and bully shy misfits; in a time when itxe2x80x99s getting less acceptable to persecute people because of their race or their sexuality or their disability, itxe2x80x99s still fair game to bully people for liking cartoons. But this mild exclusion is fading, as the generations turn over and a larger and larger percent of Americans grew up enjoying Japanese pop cultural products. Just as xe2x80x9cgeekxe2x80x9d became a positive thing when the Star Wars generation came of age, xe2x80x9cweebxe2x80x9d will probably shift first to an ironically positive word (xe2x80x9cLOL, Ixe2x80x99m such a weeb!xe2x80x9d), and then finally to something lots of people want to be. And that will lead to a dilution of the subculture xe2x80x94 weekend warriors showing up en masse to anime conventions, until those transform from subcultural refuges to corporate marketing stunts. In fact, this is already happening. And the internet makes every subculture more porous. Hopefully this will have an upside, as TV creators and filmmakers and novelists start to depict weeb culture in the stories Americans tell about ourselves.But the true, hardcore weeb subculture will live on. Itxe2x80x99s too cool and creative to die out. And it serves too important of a social purpose for the people in it.

LovecraftIn 2019, the world exploded in protest. There were massive, prolonged demonstrations in Hong Kong, in Chile and Venezuela and Bolivia and Colombia and Ecuador, in Russia and Spain and France, in Iraq and Iran and Lebanon and Algeria, in Indonesia and Haiti. We in the chattering classes spent much of the latter part of that year thinking about the protests, writing about them, theorizing about them, even visiting or joining them. We asked why this was happening. Was it a revolt against inequality? Or authoritarianism? Or was it just a fad enabled by new social media technologies? We felt like we were witnessing something historic, but we couldnxe2x80x99t tell what we were looking at.Even the arrival of a once-in-a-century pandemic didnxe2x80x99t douse the flames of unrest for long. The U.S. saw the biggest eruption of protests in its history in the summer of 2020, and those demonstrations were echoed across much of the world. The people of Belarus and Myanmar have poured into the streets in existential struggles against their dictatorial governments. India has had two entirely separate massive waves of demonstrations xe2x80x94 one by farmers over agricultural policy, another against a discriminatory citizenship law. Overall, 2020 has seen even more protests than 2019:You can track ongoing protests with the Carnegie Endowmentxe2x80x99s Protest Tracker. At this point there are so many that the map looks like someone spilled orange paint all over it.Soon, as Covidxe2x80x99s danger wanes, wexe2x80x99re going to wake up and remember that something unsettling is happening to our world. ShareThere were quite a few theories as to why the 2019 protests were happening. These could basically be broken down into three categories:1) The Economic Theory: Economic issues are often a trigger for mass unrest. The farm protests in India are obviously over economics. Chilexe2x80x99s protests were triggered by anger over a subway fare increase, Iranxe2x80x99s by an increase in fuel prices, and Francexe2x80x99s by anger over taxes. Some have theorized that the 2019-20 protests were a general revolt against economic inequality. Even in Hong Kong, I saw graffiti expressing anger over high rents. 2) The Political Theory: The protests in Myanmar and Belarus are against leaders who seized or held onto power illegitimately. Hong Kong was about Chinaxe2x80x99s authoritarian encroachment, while Cataloniaxe2x80x99s were a separatist movement. Americaxe2x80x99s protests were about police brutality and racism, while Indiaxe2x80x99s protests over the citizenship law were about exclusion of minorities. Even in Chile, where economic issues were at the forefront, anger at the legacy of the Pinochet government was a factor. 3) The Technology Theory: The various protests have had so many different triggers that some have speculated that technology simply makes protests easier than they used to be. The key technology is social media, which allows outrages to spread rapidly and also facilitates mass ad-hoc organizing. Martin Gurrixe2x80x99s The Revolt of the Public and Zeynep Tufekcixe2x80x99s Twitter and Tear Gas are the key books here. Personally, my guess is that while all three of these are important, (2) is the dominant one. Economic protests are a common phenomenon, especially in poor countries, but there was nothing particularly bad about 2019 in economic terms. Meanwhile, it seems likely that Twitter and other social media helped spark and organize protests, but there have been massive waves of unrest in the past that required no such fancy gadgetry. If I were forced to make a conjecture about the most important driver of unrest, Imy guess would be that it was the result of a general realization that bad people are running the world. Herexe2x80x99s a graphic from Freedom Housexe2x80x99s Freedom in the World 2020 report, showing the 14-year-long decline in democracy:The whole report is worth reading, and they make an explicit connection between declining democracy and unrest. In fact I think there are two aspects to this. First, therexe2x80x99s the shift of power toward authoritarian hegemons. With the invasion of Iraq and the election of Trump, the U.S. has become far less liberal of a hegemon than it was in the late 20th century (it has fallen substantially in Freedom Housexe2x80x99s rankings). And the rise of China means that the U.S. is now far less of a hegemon, period. Meanwhile, China itself is taking an alarmingly authoritarian, even totalitarian turn under Xi Jinping, even as the countryxe2x80x99s power and confidence builds. Meanwhile, Brexit, the rise of Modi, and a still-powerful Putin mean that itxe2x80x99s hard to find great powers in the world that are clearly still in the liberal camp. The general feeling that bad hegemons are in charge of the planet could fester in the backs of peoplexe2x80x99s minds, causing them to strike out at authorities closer to home in the name of democracy, freedom, equality, and so on. And awareness of hegemonic illiberalism is coupled with an awareness of rising authoritarianism closer to home, as many countries embrace their own versions of Trump/Xi/Modi/Putin. The result, according to Freedom House, is that the people of the world are engaged in a xe2x80x9cleaderless struggle for democracyxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 a struggle thatxe2x80x99s both local and global at the same time. I kind of buy that story, to be honest. That could explain why the protests have seemed to inspire each other, despite being nominally about very different issues. And to underscore the importance and non-triviality of this struggle, itxe2x80x99s noteworthy that more liberal countries have tended to be much more responsive to their protesters. To understand this global wave of protests a bit better, I think itxe2x80x99s instructive to look at the various results of some of the protests, and compare them with the general liberal-ness of the countries in which they happened. To make that comparison, Ixe2x80x99ll use Freedom Housexe2x80x99s scores (a 0-100 scale, with 100 being the most free). Those scores appear in parentheses:China (9): After a modest initial success (forcing the withdrawal of an extradition bill), Hong Kongxe2x80x99s protests were eventually crushed by a draconian new security law, with many prominent activists arrested. Hong Kong is now suffering an exodus of people and money as the result of a general loss of freedom.Belarus (11): President Lukashenko has not relinquished power. Venezuela (14): Supporters of rival presidential claimants have been deadlocked.Iran (16): The government violently cracked down on protesters, killing an estimated 1500 and suppressing the protests in just three days, though there have been isolated flare-ups since then. Russia (20): Some very minor political concessions were made. The government was not especially violent in its protest response. There was an attempt to assassinate opposition leader Alexei Navalny. A new wave of protests is now happening.Myanmar (28): The army, which supports the military coup leaders, has killed hundreds of civilians and appears intent on violently suppressing the protests while making no concessions.Iraq (29): Protests were met with violence, but forced the resignation of the prime minister and changes to the election law.Algeria (32): Various politicians resigned, and there were legal changes to strengthen the judiciary and the legislature.Lebanon (43): The prime minister and various other politicians resigned.Ecuador (67): The government reversed the austerity measures that sparked the protests.India (67): The police were fairly violent in their response to the citizenship law protest, killing dozens. The government did not rescind the citizenship law or make other concessions. As for the farmersxe2x80x99 protest, there were a few modest legal concessions made.United States (83): Police responded to protests with widespread but mostly nonlethal violence, which was widely condemned. Various police reform measures have been introduced in cities, and both companies and the government have committed to a variety of anti-racism measures. Democrats are attempting police reform at the national level.France (90): Various taxes were reduced or cancelled.Spain (90): Catalonia has not been granted independence. Chile (93): Police responded with occasionally lethal violence. Eventually various egalitarian economic reforms were announced, as well as a plebiscite to write a new constitution to replace the current one written under Pinochet.Though the pattern isnxe2x80x99t absolute, you can see that countries that are more free (by Freedom Housexe2x80x99s definition) tended to be less brutal toward protesters and offer greater concessions to protestersxe2x80x99 demands. Indiaxe2x80x99s brutality and intransigence and Algeriaxe2x80x99s liberalizing response are exceptions here, but overall protests seem to have a much higher chance of succeeding in more liberal countries. If we look at the global unrest as a general backlash against the encroachment of authoritarianism and unfreedom, we can see the protests as a sort of test of local regimes. Overall, liberal regimes are passing the test and illiberal regimes are failing it. It really does matter what kind of country you live in. This pattern is both encouraging and discouraging. On one hand, it means that liberalism is in some sense still doing its job, responding to popular sentiment by accommodating the peoplexe2x80x99s wishes. On the other hand, the fact that liberalism itself is diminishing means that this benefit will probably weaken. And more worryingly, unlike in the 1980s and 1990s when many protests toppled illiberal regimes and replaced them with more inclusive ones, todayxe2x80x99s protests are generally not succeeding in forcing liberalization.And the most worrying question of all is whether this unrest is actually a prelude to something far more destructive.Many previous waves of unrest have heralded outbreaks of war. The Arab Spring led directly to wars in Syria, Yemen, and Libya that have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The unrest at the end of the Cold War presaged a decade of post-Soviet conflicts. Of course the 1920s and especially the 1930s were times of great unrest around the world, much of which fed into the cataclysm of World War 2.One possibility that was discussed a lot during the Trump era is a second U.S. civil war. Undoubtedly the possibility that unrest will lead to a national collapse and a protracted struggle is still on many peoplexe2x80x99s minds after the coup attempt of January 6th. A U.S. collapse would in turn leave a global power vacuum that would probably give rise to all kinds of conflicts xe2x80x94 much as the USSRxe2x80x99s collapse did in the 90s, but on a much vaster scale, especially given that in the 90s the U.S. was still there to provide some stability. Regional powers would fight regional conflicts, China would assert hegemony over Asia, Russia might try more military adventures, and so on. Nuclear proliferation might be rapid.Alternatively, itxe2x80x99s possible that the current era of unrest will end in a world war, like the 1930s did. All the ingredients are there for a clash between the U.S. and China over Taiwan in the imminent future. Or China could get in a fight with India over their disputed, militarized border, or with Japan over disputed islands. A world war could arise as a diversionary war, with countries embracing international conflict as a release valve for anger at home. But as I said in the previous section, I suspect that the global protests are actually an attempt to battle back against the illiberalism creeping over their world. And I think that illiberal regimes, rather than protests, are the biggest risk for war. Democratic peace theory might or might not be right in general, but itxe2x80x99s clear that a world ruled by Xi, Modi, Putin, and someone like Donald Trump would not be a safe one. If regimes like these do end up going to war, we might remember the protest wave that began in 2019 as a failed last-ditch attempt to stop it.ShareFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I think the thing with Brexit is that it plausibly has the same causal factors as the rest of populist and authoritarian global trend, while at the same time definitely not being in the same category of antidemocratic and authoritarian that Trump, Modi, Xi are in.I hate to say it, but I think you're right.  We all need to buckle up.  And we need to keep fighting for freedom against Kefka (Trump) and Sephiroth (Putin).  And also evil Winnie the Pooh over there in China.  xf0x9fx91x8exf0x9fx91x8exf0x9fx91x8eNo posts","title":"The Great Protest Wave - Noahpinion","url":"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-great-protest-wave"}

In the following guest post, Bill writes about lessons that the Biden administration and its successors can draw from the New Dealxe2x80xa6or as he calls it, the First New Deal.William H. JanewayUniversity of Cambridge/Warburg PincusApril 5, 2021Metaphors matter.  As a metaphor, the xe2x80x9cNew Dealxe2x80x9d has been mobilized both in response to climate change and in support of President Bidenxe2x80x99s rescue and infrastructure initiatives. It needs examination if it is to go from serving as a mere slogan to defining a coherent program.  Compelling invocation of the New Deal turns on: Building state capacity for implementing interventions in the market economy; Navigating potential conflicts in overlapping missions; and Managing inescapable tradeoffs between efficiency versus effectiveness.For a long generation from Pearl Harbor, the language of war provided the liberating rationale for mobilization of resources by the American state.  Liberating, because a legitimate war frees state actors from the constraints of prospective cost-benefit analysis, where the costs are always easier to quantify than the putative benefits. xe2x80x9cWhatever it takesxe2x80x9d is the message.From World War II through the Korean conflict and the 40-year Cold War, including the War on Cancer, this metaphor did its job. The overriding importance of the mission outweighed the economic calculus of opportunity cost versus net present value of expected returns.  In this spirit, World War II was won xe2x80x9con the unorganized momentum of American Democracy,xe2x80x9d not by the efficient allocation of scarce resources amongst competing demands.[1] But after Vietnam, the endless quagmires of Afghanistan and Iraq, the War on Drugs, and the Global War on Terror, the language of war has lost its rallying force.  It has been debased.  This why retrieval of the xe2x80x9cNew Dealxe2x80x9d as metaphor is so relevant.In folk memory, FDRxe2x80x99s New Deal combined relief, reform, and positive investment in one great seamless demonstration of the progressive potential of vigorous government.  In reality, it was complicated and conflicted.  Multiple references to FDRxe2x80x99s own statement of purpose in his 1932 campaign hint at recognition:The country needs and unless I mistake its temper the country demands bold persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it If it fails admit it frankly and try another. But above all try something.The successive experiments that characterized the New Deal during FDRxe2x80x99s first two terms, prior to the onset of World War II, illustrate the conflicts - even contradictions xe2x80x93 that may be expected to result from improvising policy responses to crisis. Consideration of those policy responses focuses attention on three prime lessons for any administration that seeks to devise and execute grand programs, whether in response to systemic financial and economic collapse, a viral pandemic, or climate change.  New Deal: At the onset of the Great Depression, the economic footprint of the Federal Government was minimal: expenditures were less than 2% of retrospective estimates of GDP. Apart from the armed forces totaling some 260,000, Federal civilian employment at 500,000 (half of whom worked for the Post Office) was only 1% of the employed labor force of 50 million.  By the time Franklin Roosevelt took office in March 1933, the share of Federal expenditures had almost doubled, but that was because GDP had declined in nominal terms by almost 50%.[2]This meant that the new agencies created during the famous First Hundred Days were starting from scratch. For example, the Public Works Administration (discussed at greater length below), created by legislation on June 16, 1933, hired some 6,000 staff in two months.  The Deputy Administrator, Henry M. Waite, subsequently recalled:First they hired lawyers, many lawyers xe2x80x93 more than 100 for the Washington office alonexe2x80xa6After the lawyers came the engineersxe2x80xa6Added to all these were the platoons of accountants, clerks, stenographers, and typists, until there were more than 2,300 jammed into the Interior Department building.[3]Another 3,700 new recruits staffed the PWAxe2x80x99s 10 regional offices.The same was true of all the other alphabet soup of Administrations, Agencies, Bureaus, and Commissions created under conditions of extreme urgency.  Inevitably the Federal programs had to look to the states for support in implementation.  But, constrained by their constitutional requirements to balance their budgets, state expenditures fell with the Depression-forced reduction in their tax revenues.  And so, in critical instances as we shall see, partnerships with business became a fact of life.In one crucial respect, however, FDRxe2x80x99s capacity to mobilize state authority was unchallenged.  Massive Democratic majorities in Congress backed his executive initiatives through his First Term, even though the power wielded by the Southern segregationist components of his coalition were manifest in every piece of New Deal legislation. Substantial congressional opposition only emerged in the late 1930s, as Southern Democrats increasingly aligned with a Republican minority much strengthened in the 1938 off-year election.[4]Today: In 2018, Michael Lewis correctly anticipated the crisis of state capacity that confronted the Biden Administration in January 2021.[5]  That crisis was compounded of two processes operating on two very different timescales.  A generation-long effort to restrict the scope and scale of the Federal Governmentxe2x80x99s engagement with the market economy was aggressively pursued whenever Republican Administrations and/or Republic majorities in Congress held power, from 1981 on.  And from the Carter Administration, which initiated the first roll back of market regulations, through the Clinton Administration and even to some extent during the Obama Administration, Democratic neoliberals acquiesced.  Agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department were starved of funds.  The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment was closed. As Matt Stoller has documented, government officials were mandated to defer to increasingly concentrated private contractors with the expected consequences in terms of rent extraction both by suppliers and the consultants increasingly invited into the process.[6]During the four years of the Trump Administration, the attack on state capacity accelerated in new ways.  On the one hand, any existing element of the Federal Government that could be deemed concerned with responding to climate change was proposed for liquidation, as was the Energy Departmentxe2x80x99s Advanced Research Projects Agency.  Additionally, whether or not Congress (as with ARPA-E) refused to confirm such initiatives, the Trump Administration pursued a less transparent course.Across the Federal Government, new rules and regulations were promulgated to reduce the reach of the xe2x80x9cAdministrative State,xe2x80x9d deemed pernicious by construction.  And Trump appointed senior personnel dedicated to opposing the mission of those agencies they had been chosen to lead.  To the extent possible, they were granted civil service status to render it more difficult for the new Administration to remove and replace them.Everywhere access to expert scientific and technological policy guidance was minimized if not totally foreclosed. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is a case in point: it took 18 months from Trumpxe2x80x99s inauguration for any Director to be appointed and once appointed there is xe2x80x9cscant evidencexe2x80x9d evidence that the Director tried to mitigate any of the administrationxe2x80x99s most controversial policies relating to science and innovation. The list includes its chaotic approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, rolling back a slew of environmental regulations, restricting immigration, and proposing deep cuts in the budgets of most federal research agencies.[7]The Biden Administration has an enormous challenge just to undo the damage wrought in the past four years.  But there is a further, transcendent component of state capacity, one that for the most part FDR did not have to confront, at least until he was challenged to pledge, during the 1940 presidential campaign, that xe2x80x9cyour boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.xe2x80x9d  This is the matter of basic trust in the countryxe2x80x99s political leadership.President Biden may be constructing a path towards rebuilding trust through success in delivering the Corona virus vaccines to the arms of the American public as well as delivering the retroactive insurance payments provided by the American Rescue Plan.  Demonstration of what a competent state can deliver in pursuit of a well-defined mission is a necessary step.  So far, it appears that the President has met the most critical test: Under Promise and Over Perform.  The broad public support he has earned stands in stark contrast with the almost unanimous opposition of Republicans in the narrowly divided houses of Congress.New Deal: FDRxe2x80x99s New Deal encompassed three strategic missions: recovery from the Depression, reform of particular aspects of the market economy, and regime change in the fundamental structure of the American political economy. A necessary condition for freedom to act was an assertion of nationalist autonomy: escape from the xe2x80x9cgolden fettersxe2x80x9d of the gold standard and refusal to stabilize the international value of the dollar against sterling or the franc.[8]On December 31, 1933, the New York Times published an open letter from John Maynard Keynes to President Roosevelt. The core of the message was delivered in the third paragraph:You are engaged on a double task, Recovery and Reform;--recovery from the slump and the passage of those business and social reforms which are long overdue. For the first, speed and quick results are essential. The second may be urgent too; but haste will be injurious, and wisdom of long-range purpose is more necessary than immediate achievement. It will be through raising high the prestige of your administration by success in short-range Recovery, that you will have the driving force to accomplish long-range Reform. On the other hand, even wise and necessary Reform may, in some respects, impede and complicate Recovery. For it will upset the confidence of the business world and weaken their existing motives to action, before you have had time to put other motives in their placexe2x80xa6.[9]Keynesxe2x80x99 economic genius was not fully matched by his political insight, even in Britain where he failed to win over the political and administrative leadership of the country to overt policies of macroeconomic stabilization until World War II.[10]  FDR, by contrast, recognized that the context of crisis was necessary to enable the profound structural reforms to the American political economy that he proposed.  The central policy to which Keynes addressed himself was the National Recovery Administration, Part 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act passed in June 1933.  The NRA proposed a comprehensive system of xe2x80x9ccodes of fair competitionxe2x80x9d that were required to include: (1) a specified minimum wage, (2) a specified maximum number of working hours per week, and (3) recognition of the workersxe2x80x99 right to collective bargaining. The goal was simultaneously to restore the profitability of employers and to increase the purchasing of power of employees. The means were the legal cartelization of markets, both for goods and labor services.Often neglected by economic analysts of the NRA is that the author of its source-text was no New Deal radical but rather Gerard Swope, President of General Electric. In September 1931, Swope had proposed a national assemblage of trade associations under the supervision of the Federal Trade Commission with authority comparable to the NRAxe2x80x99s codes.[11] Following where Swope had led, the NRA precisely operationalized Adam Smithxe2x80x99s famous remark: xe2x80x9cPeople of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the publick, or in some contrivance to raise prices.xe2x80x9d Given the constrained state capacity of the New Deal, the industry committees mandated by the NRA were dominated by business.  The tobacco industry, already notorious for its political clout, succeeded in preventing any code from emerging.  In the oligopolistic heavy industries xe2x80x93 steel, autos xe2x80x93 the Administrationxe2x80x99s only bargaining chip, exemption from anti-trust enforcement, was irrelevant. By the summer of 1934, after a transient surge in prices and wages, noncompliance was rampant.[12]  A year later, the Supreme Court declared the NRA and other New Deal interventions on the supply side of the market economy unconstitutional. By denying that the federal government had the authority to respond to the crisis, the Court transformed a policy fiasco into a popular political cause.As the incipient recovery appeared to stall and in response to the Courtxe2x80x99s challenge, FDR launched the substantially more radical xe2x80x9cSecond New Dealxe2x80x9d of 1935, encompassing the Social Security Act, the National Labor Relations (xe2x80x9cWagnerxe2x80x9d) Act, the Banking Act of 1935, the Rural Electrification Administration, and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act. Recovery resumed in timely fashion for FDRxe2x80x99s triumphant reelection in 1936: Recovery and Reform marched hand in hand. Although the extent to which the Supreme Court xe2x80x9cfollowed the election returnsxe2x80x9d is contested, in the event the Court broadly validated the constitutionality of the Second New Deal.Today: The immediate strategic priority facing the Biden Administration embodies no conflict: to accelerate Recovery from the pandemic in order to Restore economic prosperity.  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, however, combines funding for enhanced vaccination programs and retroactive insurance payments for those economically damaged by public health lockdowns with a host of progressive reforms.  Measures such as expanded child and earned income tax credits may be formally time limited, but they suggest this Administration knows how to exploit crisis for progressive ends, very much in the spirit of the second phase of FDRxe2x80x99s New Deal.Looking Forward, Response to climate change, Inequality of income and wealth, and Racial Justice may seem bound to compete for priority. But, not unlike the first New Dealxe2x80x99s haphazard integration of recovery and reform and President Bidenxe2x80x99s own American Rescue Plan, programs to xe2x80x9cgreenxe2x80x9d the U.S. economy can serve both to reduce inequality and promote racial justice. The specific mix of programs and the ways of financing them are what matter.  Integration of such priorities can be approached by concentrating direct state funding and indirect state subsidies, financed by progressive taxation, to deliver green infrastructure preferentially to those constituencies without the resources to protect themselves from the impact of climate change.  One central initiative xe2x80x93 reflexively recommended by almost all conventional economists xe2x80x93 is a carbon tax high enough to endogenize the costs that generating carbon dioxide imposes on the environment.  Get the prices right, mainstream economics asserts, and the market will take care of the rest, efficiently allocating resources to serve the multiplicity of demands.  But resource allocation is not all that markets do.  They also distribute the returns generated by the employment of those resources. One unconventional, Nobel-prize winning economist, Joe Stiglitz, identifies the crucial flaw in the argument for a carbon tax: carbon taxes have distributive implications. In particular, it may be (if carbon consumption increases less than in proportion to income), and be perceived to be, regressive.[13]The politics of a carbon tax are further complicated because the distributional consequences are not only xe2x80x9cvertical,xe2x80x9d adversely affecting the poor more than the rich, but also xe2x80x9chorizontal,xe2x80x9d with differential impacts on people with similar incomes but different degrees of dependence on carbon-generating sources.  One obvious example is the difference between city-dwellers with access to public transportation and rural populations utterly dependent on their cars.  Any resort to taxing carbon is bound to be complicated by rebates and exemptions and augmented by regulations such as increased fuel efficiency standards or even xe2x80x93 as in the UK xe2x80x93 by prospective banning of hydrocarbon fueled automobiles.Consideration of a carbon tax as the solution calls attention to the third dimension along which we can learn from the first New Deal.  This is the inevitable tension between Efficiency and Effectiveness.  In economic terms, a Carbon tax, indeed, would be theoretically the most efficient response.  But when it comes to responding to crisis, Efficiency can be the enemy of Effectiveness.   FDRxe2x80x99s New Deal offers a most relevant case in point.New Deal:The National Industrial Recovery Act had two parts.  In addition to the NRA, it also created the Public Works Administration with an unprecedented appropriation of $3.5 billion. Recall that at the time, total Federal annual expenditures were less than $2 billion. What is more, dramatizing the conflicts engendered by aggressive experimentation, the Economy Act of 1933 has already been passed to reduce Federal expenditures by $500 million, honoring a campaign pledge to restore confidence by balancing the budget, whose deficit was the result of the collapse in tax receipts.  FDR squared the circle by establishing an Emergency Budget, which included the PWA, distinct from the traditional one.As Administrator of the PWA, FDR named his Interior Secretary Harold Ickes.  Ickes was a committed progressive who had left the Republican Party to join Teddy Rooseveltxe2x80x99s third- party campaign in 1912 and never returned.  He inherited an Interior Department that was deeply tainted by corruption, most recently by the Teapot Dome Scandal of the Harding Administration: the then Secretary had been bribed to lease naval oil reserves under the Departmentxe2x80x99s supervision to private oilmen.  Ickes was determined to reconstruct the Departmentxe2x80x99s reputation as subject neither to financial nor political influence.  And this determination carried over to the PWA.    A project proposed for PWA funding passed through a sequence of detailed analyses - engineering, legal, economic, financial -, before it worked its way up to FDR himself for final approval. For Ickes, this was a feature, not a bug. His biographer puts it well:Ickes firmly held that speed was less important than stability, permanence, and a fair return to the government for its investment.[14]After six months, only $110 million of the appropriation had actually been spent.[15]Business Week remarked that xe2x80x9cMr. Ickes is running a fire department on the principles of a good, sound bond house.xe2x80x9d                 Under xe2x80x9cHonest Harold,xe2x80x9d however, the PWA delivered a host of great works, from the Triboro Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel in New York to the Grand Coulee Dam and San Francisco Bay Bridge in the far west, and all without scandal.  The PWA, indeed, represented efficiencyin the expenditure of public moneys for public goods.   But measured unemployment was still above 20% when the first appropriation ended in 1935.  In response, FDR turned to a man, Harry Hopkins, who was temperamentally Ickes opposite while also possessed of relationships with those big city machines that Ickes had dedicated himself to fighting.  And Hopkins had already demonstrated remarkable effectivenessin the early days of the New Deal.            In October 1933, with few signs of recovery visible, $400 million had been pulled out of the PWA to fund the Civil Works Administration, the New Dealxe2x80x99s first program of xe2x80x9cwork relief.xe2x80x9d  Under Hopkins, the CWA put more than 4 million men to work at PWA wages (well above the paltry level of relief payments) in barely three months.  It was, in fact, so effective in spending its money that it ran out of cash and closed down on March 1934.Now, frustrated by the slow pace of recovery and appropriately alert to the rise of radical voices such as Louisianaxe2x80x99s Huey Long, FDR asked and got $4.8 billion for a new program of work relief.  The Works Progress Administration was led by Hopkins over Ickes staunch objections. It was inevitably politicized, both by the need to rely on local proposals for projects and Hopkins own propensity for alliance with local political powers.  It was all the more effective as the result, giving work to more than 5 million men over its first three years.  The broad range of projects, including public art and entertainment as well as road improvements and sewage works, led critics to label it the sponsor of xe2x80x9cboondoggles.xe2x80x9d  In 1935, Ickes suggested to Vice President Garner that xe2x80x9cthe way the money was administered might mean the defeat of the administration next year.xe2x80x9d[16]  As usual, FDR understood the politics, remarking: xe2x80x9cIf we can boondoggle our way out of the Depression, that word is going to be enshrined in the hearts of Americans for many years to come.xe2x80x9d The PWA and the WPA exemplify the programmatic and institutional alternatives for how to mobilize resources for strategic purposes.  During the first New Deal, they turned out to be complements, although they were hardly planned as such. On a project by project basis, with each project of grand scale and logistical complexity, the PWA represented efficiency in the allocation of large quanta of capital: a model for the future. Given the overriding priority of getting men off relief and into work, the WPA demonstrated effective response to urgent need. In fashioning any comprehensive response to climate change, President Biden will need to avoid sacrificing effectiveness in pursuit of efficiency, especially as Republican opposition is likely to fixate on programs they oppose in principle as wasteful boondoggles in practice.  Yet effective response to climate change will necessarily include grand projects of transformational infrastructure, where manifestly wasteful inefficiency may threaten to undermine support for the mission itself.  The next New Deal will need both its PWA and its WPA.Today: Response to the Corona virus to date provides an illustrative cross-cutting chronicle of failure and success:First, failure to orchestrate access to key supplies xe2x80x93 masks, ventilators - generated a fiasco of competitive bidding by state governments and amongst federal agencies as President Trump sought to deny a national responsibility that the presidential election demonstrated he could not evade.  But then the xe2x80x9cWarp Speedxe2x80x9d program of vaccine development combined efficiency and effectiveness.  Multiple parallel projects were funded by pre-production procurement contracts as well as R&D grants and covered the spectrum from traditional approaches to the innovative mRNA technologies deployed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Third, however, delivery of vaccines into arms reverted to the same fragmented, inefficient and ineffective process that characterized the first months of the pandemic until the new Administration brought some coherent rigor to the task.Throughout, the diverse array of xe2x80x9cnon-pharmaceuticalxe2x80x9d regulations and guidelines across the American landscape xe2x80x93 and opposition thereto - confirmed that the pandemic response would express, not override, political polarization.Even in the absence of the political polarization that has infected American government, fashioning programs that appropriately balance between efficiency and effectiveness would be hard. Yet the difficulty may be somewhat eased because, when it comes to climate change, it appears that the public is ahead of many politicians.[17] Of the sample polled by a consortium of Yale and George Mason Universities, 75% support rejoining the Paris Agreement, 66% say developing clean energy sources should be a high or very high federal priority; 55-82% support a broad range of regulatory and tax initiatives to encourage reduction in carbon-generating production and consumption.  On every subject, the partisan split between Democrats and Republicans is visible. As with the American Rescue Plan, Bidenxe2x80x99s appeals to bipartisanship are likely to resonate more outside than inside Washington.  And it is suggestive that 66% of those polled xe2x80x9csupport the Green New Deal,xe2x80x9d although understandably at this stage xe2x80x9conly 18% say they have heard xe2x80x98a lotxe2x80x99 about it.In 1933, evidence of crisis was unavoidable even for those most insulated by wealth: the Dow Jones Index had declined by 88% from its 1929 high; Hoovervilles of the homeless were found in public parks across the nationxe2x80x99s cities; and the banks were closing everywhere.  The mandate for action was manifest. Today, building and maintaining the mandate will be an essential element of all responsive initiatives. What will be comparable to the New Deal is the wide range of programs of varying degrees of relevance to the multiple missions facing the Biden Administration post-pandemic.Princeton University has recently published a comprehensive agenda for achieving xe2x80x9cNet-Zero Americaxe2x80x9d by 2050.[18] The report presents an array of programs under 6 headings:xc2xb7         End-use energy efficiency and electrificationxc2xb7         Clean electricity: wind & solar generation, transmission, firm powerxc2xb7         Bioenergy and other zero-carbon fuels and feedstocksxc2xb7         COxe2x82x82 capture, utilization, and storagexc2xb7         Reduced non-COxe2x82x82 emissionsxc2xb7         Enhanced land sinksOf these, some call out for the sort of meticulous planning and careful implementation that characterized the PWAxe2x80x99s grand projects. Such will be the case with the necessary requirement to expand and extend and harden electricity grids nationally (even in Texas) and to deploy software to manage intermittent sources of electricity. But with other initiatives, especially when they concern the gains available from mass electrification at the residential and retail level, effectiveness should dominate efficiency. One example of the latter, referenced in the Princeton Report, is the plan for xe2x80x9cRewiring Americaxe2x80x9d conceived by Saul Griffith and his colleagues: to bring electrification to American households funded by subsidized credit.[19] Using electricity alone for heating, cooking, and transportation would not only contribute massively to the Net-Zero goal.  The process of universal electrification would generate millions of xe2x80x9cgreen jobsxe2x80x9d and yield significant reductions in the cost of living.  But the very distributed nature of the program xe2x80x93 like the WPA xe2x80x93 is bound to generate some degree of waste: unrepaid loans, faulty installations.  Public tolerance of such necessary inefficiency will turn on broad public acceptance of the mission.One example of an initiative that can serve all three missions would directly draw on a first New Deal model.  Then, the Rural Electrification Administration brought electricity to Americans ignored by the public utilities as uneconomic to serve.  Today, the xe2x80x9cdigital dividexe2x80x9d reveals an inverse correlation between income and access to broadband internet that intersects the urban rural divide.[20] When the pandemic closed schools across the country, the impact of the Digital Divide on access to education and prospective life chances was devastating.  At the same time, the positive effect of virtual working and meeting on carbon-generating travel adds to the case for a xe2x80x9cBroadband Access Administrationxe2x80x9d that would serve all three missions.The Princeton Report correctly recognizes the need for frontier innovation of critical technologies. Two examples are grid-scale energy storage and carbon capture and sequestration.  Here the history of the American innovation economy offers a compelling model.  The US Defense Departmentxe2x80x99s support for all the emergent technologies that combined to make the Digital Revolution was not limited to funding R&D.  It included programs of procurement xe2x80x93 of computers, semiconductors, software xe2x80x93 before they were cheap and reliable enough for the commercial markets.  The American state pulled the suppliers down the learning curve, preferentially favoring young, entrepreneurial companies like Texas Instruments and Intel over the established giant incumbents, IBM and ATT.  This was the model implicitly and effectively followed by Project Warp Speed.There is another opportunity for the Biden Administration to learn from the Obama Administrationxe2x80x99s American recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Not only is that xe2x80x9cstimulus billxe2x80x9d now recognized as having been sub-scale. But the xe2x80x9cgreenxe2x80x9d elements buried within it were misconceived.  The Act extended nine-figure loan guarantees to a set of GreenTech ventures. One of them was Tesla, which paid off its loans from the massive private funding that Elon Musk subsequently mobilized.  Two others, sadly, were Solyndra in solar panels and A123 in advanced battery technology.  Both went bust in highly visible fashion.  Procurement contracts to follow R&D grants were the available alternatives, against which they might have been able to secure conventional venture capital and incidentally avoid political embarrassment if they nonetheless failed.  One strategic issue will confront the President Biden in more nuanced and complex fashion than that which faced FDR: go it alone or collaborate.  In 1933, international collaboration would have meant freezing the American state in the face of calamity, even while protectionist programs of national economic defense were proliferating globally: from the UKxe2x80x99s abandonment of free trade in favor of Imperial Preference to Nazi Germanyxe2x80x99s autarchic determination to escape from the Versailles Treaty.The choice is more complex today, not only because climate change is existentially global, as symbolically acknowledged by Bidenxe2x80x99s return to the Paris Agreement.  At the practical level of implementation, forty years of globalization has left the US bereft of the high-tech manufacturing base that had been constructed over the previous forty years.  The combination of free-trade political economics and shareholder-maximization financial economics made abandonment of that strategic resource both economically logical and politically acceptable. Doubling down in strategic opposition to Chinaxe2x80x99s rise, therefore, has costs that go to the heart of an effective response to climate change. To begin with, China generates 29% of the worldxe2x80x99s annual production of COxe2x82x82; the US follows with 16%.  No global response to the global problem can leave out either. Beyond that fact, a recent paper in Science magazine asserts an obvious hypothesis:Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement will require net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and substantial reductions before then. It will also require collaboration with China, which has emerged as the global leader in the mass production of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs). In part because of China's investments in manufacturing, the LCETs required to meet climate targets have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuel sources.[21]As the authors acknowledge, xe2x80x9csome attribute China's rapid rise in LCET sectors to unfair industrial policiesxe2x80x94such as forced technology transfer requirements, massive subsidies, and outright intellectual property (IP) theft.xe2x80x9d Pragmatically, nonetheless, we are where we are. A wise man once said that political leadership resides in fashioning third alternatives to seemingly intractable dilemmas.  Such alternatives may exist on each side.  Necessarily inefficient US investments aimed at rebuilding at home the capacity that now exists in China may well prove the effective game theoretic approach towards strategic collaboration.  It will likely be matched by Chinaxe2x80x99s equally inefficient determination to reach the frontier in semiconductor design and fabrication in order to reduce its strategic dependence on the US.  Saikat Chakrabarti was the co-author of the plan for a xe2x80x9cGreen New Dealxe2x80x9d brought to public attention by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  He has summarized the shared purpose of the initiators:(1) Create a plan that Democratic presidential candidates would have to respond to, creating pressure on them to have a race to the top against each other on climate proposals. We aimed to have an order of magnitude increase in the ambition of climate proposals being put out by presidential candidates and, through that, dramatically change the scale of what would be xe2x80x9cpolitically acceptable.xe2x80x9d(2) Introduce (but really reintroduce) a new approach to solving climate change that didnxe2x80x99t pit jobs against climate, but made the project of solving climate change the same as growing, upgrading and developing our economy, creating millions of high wage jobs in the process.[22]The tactical political initiative worked: through the presidential primaries that candidate Biden wound up dominating climate change gained traction as a salient issue. The central strategic insight is more remarkable and resonates with FDRxe2x80x99s rejection of Keynesxe2x80x99 advice to separate explicitly Recovery from Reform.  Given the intensely conflicted state of the American political economy today, it reaches beyond the terms set by Chakrabarti. Any opportunity to serve the two missions that overlap in political space with response to climate change xe2x80x93 reducing inequality and pursuing racial justice xe2x80x93 may only be addressed by implementing the broad and inclusive agenda of investment and employment that response to climate change legitimizes.Whether it is called xe2x80x9cBuild Back Betterxe2x80x9d or a xe2x80x9cGreen Industrial Policyxe2x80x9d or, indeed, a Green New Deal, it is imperative to reject the false dichotomy of xe2x80x9cjobs against climate.xe2x80x9d However it is branded, if response to climate change is truly to renew the grand promise and the meaningful xe2x80x93 if incomplete - achievements of the first New Deal, it will do so by addressing the cumulative inequities that have reached intolerable levels of social and cultural and political stress.  Somehow, President Biden seems to have intuited this simple, profound truth.  Without any doubt, efforts to implement that agenda will be contested every step of the way and not a few will fail.  But as FDR put it almost 90 years ago, xe2x80x9cabove all try.xe2x80x9d[1] E.

The most serious effort yet is automobile fuel-efficiency standards. My opinion is we first need as a society to honestly confront the science, and while the right is of course the main problem, the left is also dodging, resorting to vague populism about a \"Green New Deal\" and pandering to the fake-green solar lobby. We are a consumerist culture and we want to be told that there is some product we can buy that will reduce our carbon emissions. The reality is that above all else we need to stop or reverse population growth, improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and unnecessary packaging, and restore forests. We live in a world with powerful opposition to all of those things, and I have yet to see any movement in politics towards coming up with a serious plan.Is the point of the part about a carbon tax that we shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good? Or are we really dismissing it outright because it's regressive? You can just create a dividend, or increase the EITC, or fund a permanent expansion or the CTC. Easy fix.

Ixe2x80x99m sure there will be more in the days to come, and Ixe2x80x99ll have plenty of thoughts on the specific provisions as well.What I want to do in this post, however, is try to figure out what it all means. By now I think everyone has realized that something is changing in American economic policy. The tenor, pace, and scope of Bidenxe2x80x99s economic programs proposals, and the muted nature of the ideological opposition, suggest that wexe2x80x99ve entered a new policy paradigm xe2x80x94 much as when FDR took office in 1933 or Ronald Reagan in 1981. Every President comes in with a laundry list of initiatives, but once every few decades a President comes in with a new philosophy for what policy should look like. And that is happening now. The fact that a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill was passed with relatively little fuss, and was really just the warm-up to an even bigger infrastructure bill, and that other xe2x80x9cbigxe2x80x9d policies like student debt cancellation are being pursued on the side as an afterthought, should make it clear that Biden is blitzing. But whatxe2x80x99s the unifying philosophy here? What is Bidenomics? I have some thoughts. First, we need to talk a bit about why the old paradigm wasnxe2x80x99t working. ShareThe last economic policy paradigm, bequeathed to us by Ronald Reagan (and Paul Volcker), was based around tax cuts, deregulation, welfare cuts, and tight monetary policy. These were intended as remedies for the two main economic problems of the 1970s xe2x80x94 slow growth and inflation, together known as xe2x80x9cstagflationxe2x80x9d. The idea that tax cuts boost growth comes from basic economic theory; in almost any model, taxes distort the economy (except for things like carbon taxes), so if you cut taxes it should make the economy more efficient, thus increasing growth at least temporarily. The idea that deregulation boosts growth was more of an article of faith xe2x80x94 since xe2x80x9cregulationxe2x80x9d means a ton of different things, therexe2x80x99s no economic model that can capture it in a general sense (actually deregulation really started under Carter, who arguably did more than Reagan). Welfare cuts were partly based on economic theory xe2x80x94 means-tested welfare programs are a form of implicit taxation, which theoretically discourages people from working xe2x80x94 and part dogma about a xe2x80x9cculture of dependencexe2x80x9d. As for tight monetary policy xe2x80x94 or more accurately, an anti-inflationary bias at the Fed xe2x80x94 that was obviously just a response to inflation. We can argue back and forth about whether the Reagan paradigm ever boosted growth; in fact, I donxe2x80x99t know the answer. The late 80s and 90s were good years for American incomes and the 90s and early 00s were good years for productivity. How much tax cuts and deregulation had to do with that is up for debate, and how much the country benefitted from reduced inflation is also arguable. But itxe2x80x99s clear that by the 2000s and 2010s, the Reaganite paradigm wasnxe2x80x99t doing what it was supposed to do. Bush cut taxes for investors, but as Danny Yagan xe2x80x94 who is not working in the Biden administration xe2x80x94 showed, this didnxe2x80x99t boost business investment at all. In fact, tax cuts in general failed to stem the overall drop in private business investment during 1980-2020:And if income tax cuts made people work more, it certainly isnxe2x80x99t apparent in the aggregate data:As for productivity, by 2005 the computer boom was over and we were back to slow growth. That came coupled with weak competitiveness, as industrial activity fled to China. The one really enduring economic success of the Reagan age was that inflation stayed low, but therexe2x80x99s a good argument to be made that in the aftermath of the Great Recession it was too low; if the Fed had allowed inflation to rise more, it might have helped speed the recovery of the 2010s (not just through macroeconomic effects, but by hastening deleveraging). So growth slowed and investment slowed; the Reagan program wasnxe2x80x99t fixing those problems. Meanwhile inequality soared during the years after 1980. Slowing growth and soaring inequality combined to produce a stagnation in median incomes after 2000. There was an encouraging rise in the late 2010s, but not enough to shake the perception that progress for the average American had stalled. Americans were no longer doing better than their parents. Meanwhile, increased risk from the countryxe2x80x99s broken health care system, a rise in evictions, the unemployment and house price declines of the Great Recession, and the vicissitudes of 401(k) programs meant that true standards of living performed even worse than the above graph suggests.  Thus it was clear that the Reagan policy program of tax cuts, deregulation, and welfare cuts wasnxe2x80x99t working. So we needed to come up with a new paradigm. We should have come up with one in the Great Recession, but we didnxe2x80x99t. Instead, it took COVID and the insanity of the Trump administration to push us over the edge and make us realize big changes were needed. Well, we finally woke up, and here we are. The big changes are Bidenomics.The Biden program is multifaceted xe2x80x94 it includes things like support for unions, environmental protection, student debt cancellation, immigration, and a bunch of other stuff. But it would be wrong to characterize his program as merely a grab bag of long-time Democratic policy priorities. Three approaches stand out above the maelstrom:Cash benefitsCare jobsInvestmentCash benefits were at the center of the COVID relief bill that already passed. In addition to the standard COVID relief items (quasi-universal $1400 checks, special unemployment benefits, housing and medical assistance, etc.) there was a very big program that is officially temporary but which will probably be made permanent: A child allowance. Itxe2x80x99s very big in size xe2x80x94 $3000 to $3600 per child. Therexe2x80x99s no time limit and no work requirement. Itxe2x80x99s basically a pilot universal basic income program for families. The second pillar of Bidenomics is care jobs. The new xe2x80x9cinfrastructurexe2x80x9d bill includes tens of billions of dollars a year for long-term in-home care for disabled and elderly people. Biden has made it explicit since early on that he intends to make caregiving jobs a pillar of his strategy for mass employment. The third pillar of Bidenomics is investment xe2x80x94 government investment, and measures to encourage private investment. The former includes tens of billions a year in new research spending, massive construction of new green energy infrastructure like electrical grids and charging stations, retrofits of existing infrastructure (e.g. lead removal from pipes), and repair of existing infrastructure like roads and bridges. This will help restore government investment as a fraction of GDP, which has been drifting downward for decades:In other words, if private businesses arenxe2x80x99t investing enough, have government plug the hole. But in fact itxe2x80x99s not just about plugging the hole, since things like a modernized electrical grid, a network of charging stations, and lead removal are not things the private sector is likely to do (or do enough of) on its own.But the administration isnxe2x80x99t relying entirely on direct government action to lift investment xe2x80x94 not by a long shot. First of all, infrastructure is a complement to private investment; repair roads, and private businesses will buy vehicles to take advantage of those roads. Government research is also complementary to private investment xe2x80x94 therexe2x80x99s a clear pipeline from government-funded labs to privately-funded product innovation and the investment that goes with it. And finally, Bidenxe2x80x99s clean electricity standard for the power sector, which will force all U.S. electricity to be carbon-free by 2035, will require huge private investment xe2x80x94 in solar, wind, storage, hydro, and nuclear. Note how little of this investment program relies on indirect investment incentives like capital gains tax cuts or depreciation allowances. Bidenomics doesnxe2x80x99t just turn the knobs and hope that useful investment comes out xe2x80x94 it actively directs investment into particular sectors (green energy) and particular activities (science).Together, these three things xe2x80x94 cash benefits, care jobs, and investment xe2x80x94 are the pillars of the new approach thatxe2x80x99s going to replace Reaganomics. Itxe2x80x99s not a direct one-for-one substitute, any more than Reaganomics was a direct repudiation of the New Deal. Instead, while there are some reversals, much of it is orthogonal to the old paradigm, because itxe2x80x99s focused on addressing the problems of today. Before I go on to discuss the justification for this new paradigm, Ixe2x80x99d like to sum up all these xe2x80x9cpillarsxe2x80x9d into one more-or-less cohesive vision of where I think Bidenomics is taking us. I think itxe2x80x99s aiming to create a two-track economy xe2x80x94 a dynamic, internationally competitive innovation sector, and a domestically focused engine of mass employment and distributed prosperity. I basically get this notion from Japan. In the 1970s and 1980s, Japan cultivated a world-beating export sector, based around all the companies youxe2x80x99ve heard of (Toyota, Panasonic, etc.). But this was only perhaps 20% of its economy, and the rest was a domestic-focused sector. Although some domestic-focused industries were highly productive (health care!), much of the domestic-focused sector xe2x80x94 retail, finance, agriculture, utilities, and a few non-competitive manufacturing industries xe2x80x94 was not very productive compared to the U.S. But those sectors did manage to employ a huge number of people; Japan has traditionally had very low unemployment, and that has not changed with the mass entry of women into the workforce since 2012. Japan in many ways built the most effective corporate welfare state in the world. Biden and his people, Ixe2x80x99m sure, do not want the domestic-focused sectors of the economy to be unproductive. But they want those sectors to do the heavy lifting in terms of giving most Americans a job, as they did in Japan. Those domestic sectors include the care economy, where Bidenxe2x80x99s team believes much of future employment will come from. This is partly a story about technology xe2x80x94 automation, the end of mass manufacturing employment, etc. With even retail jobs commonly believed to be at risk from new technologies, many people look to care work as the last thing we know we want humans to do. But itxe2x80x99s also a story about globalization, and the shift of global economic activity from the U.S. to Asia. With Asia becoming the workshop of the world, the U.S., with its low population density and relatively remote location, has been forced to become something else xe2x80x94 the worldxe2x80x99s research park. The U.S. still has the worldxe2x80x99s best research universities, and an enormous concentration of talent from around the world. If we can sustain both those things, wexe2x80x99re well-positioned to continue to be the worldxe2x80x99s idea factory; innovation is our comparative advantage. And as long as we do that, we will maintain highly competitive knowledge industries whose specialty is continuous innovation thatxe2x80x99s downstream from government science xe2x80x94 software, high-tech manufacturing, and pharma/biotech. Thatxe2x80x99s an assembly line even China may never be able to match. But while this sector will generate a lot of productivity and a lot of export revenue, it is not going to employ most Americans. Instead, most Americans will work in less competitive, domestically focused sectors xe2x80x94 selling houses to each other, pulling each otherxe2x80x99s wisdom teeth, preparing each otherxe2x80x99s food, bagging each otherxe2x80x99s groceries, taking care of each other in their old age. That vast domestic sector will distribute the income generated by the highly competitive knowledge sectors (in fact, this is exactly how an agglomeration model of the economy works, as you can read in Paul Krugmanxe2x80x99s book with Masahisa Fujita and Anthony Venables). And that distribution of income via domestic industries is supplemented by active government redistribution of income xe2x80x94 taking a bit of money from the Elon Musks of the world and using it to make sure the mass of people have a claim to food and houses and schools and medical care.So I think Bidenomics, with its dual focus on research/investment/immigration and care jobs + cash benefits, is an attempt to boost both sectors of the economy at once xe2x80x94 to make the export sector more productive while making the domestic sector better at spreading the wealth around. If therexe2x80x99s one unified characterization of the vision Bidenomics is creating for our future, I think thatxe2x80x99s it.As with Reaganomics, Bidenomics is based on multiple sources of inspiration xe2x80x94 economics research, political imperatives, gut instinct, wishful thinking, and so on. Ixe2x80x99ll talk here about the economics part, since thatxe2x80x99s the part I know the most about. The idea that the U.S. needs more research spending probably comes from the work of Paul Romer. Romer was a pioneer of endogenous growth models, which said that the generation of new ideas is key to growth (he won a Nobel for this in 2018). That theory implies that if you spend more on research you get faster growth, and Romer has been vocal in promoting this idea. Also important is the recent research of Bloom et al. and especially of Charles Jones; these researchers suggest that we need to pour more resources into science to keep innovation going. John Van Reenen has done a lot of important work in this area as well; see his call for xe2x80x9cinnovation policy to restore American prosperityxe2x80x9d. See also the work of Daniel Gross and Bhaven Sampat, as well as that of Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson, who show how the xe2x80x9cspend more money on researchxe2x80x9d approach worked for us before.The idea of cash benefits xe2x80x94 without work requirements or time cutoffs xe2x80x94 owes much to the work of Hilary Hoynes, who keeps a low profile but is incredibly influential. The child allowance is directly from a 2018 paper by Hoynes and Diane Schanzenbach. Heather Boushey, who works in the Biden administration, has been deeply influenced by this literature. Meanwhile, an increasing amount of empirical research is showing that unconditional benefits usually donxe2x80x99t stop people from working. See the famous paper on the Alaska Permanent Fund payouts, by Damon Jones and Ioana Marinescu. And see Marinescuxe2x80x99s 2018 literature review on unconditional benefits, showing that they donxe2x80x99t have much of a deleterious effect on work output, if any. That research basically debunks the xe2x80x9cculture of dependencyxe2x80x9d argument, at least as far as unconditional cash benefits are concerned. Then see Henrik Klevenxe2x80x99s research on the EITC, showing that it was probably the cash benefit aspect, rather than the work incentive, that accomplished most of that programxe2x80x99s much-lauded poverty reduction. As for Bidenxe2x80x99s environmental focus, much of it comes from research outside the field of economics, but Martin Weitzmanxe2x80x99s research on the risks of climate change deserves a mention. This is an impressive body of research. It doesnxe2x80x99t constitute a slam-dunk case xe2x80x94 nothing ever will xe2x80x94 but itxe2x80x99s a heck of a lot better than a graph on a cocktail napkin. There are some elements of the Biden plan I didnxe2x80x99t mention, because numerically theyxe2x80x99re not very big. One of these is the industrial policy part of the infrastructure bill, which would create a new office in the Commerce department that would actively try to relocate certain industries and their supply chains in the U.S. This aspect of the bill is certain to cause the greatest howls of rage from various people who have decided that industrial policy is bad bad scary-bad.There is little solid reason to believe that industrial policy is bad bad scary-bad. The case against it has always been far more based in dogma than in evidence; like regulation, industrial policies are so multifarious and complex that itxe2x80x99s not really possible to conclude that it xe2x80x9cworksxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cdoesnxe2x80x99t workxe2x80x9d. There is some research suggesting that itxe2x80x99s important xe2x80x94 Ricardo Hausmannxe2x80x99s work on economic complexity, various research by Dani Rodrik, a few exploratory papers by the IMF, scattered studies on export subsidies, and so on. This literature is nowhere near conclusive; it doesnxe2x80x99t even agree on what constitutes industrial policy. But thatxe2x80x99s how policy actually works, in real life. There are things that experts think wonxe2x80x99t work, based on theoretical grounds; until some bold policy entrepreneur or wild-eyed nutcase actually goes and tries these things, we wonxe2x80x99t really know if they work or not. A great example is the minimum wage. Back in the 1970s, economists almost all believed that minimum wages hurt employment a lot. But they had been getting too high on their own textbook models xe2x80x94 when the evidence started rolling in, it turned out that minimum wage was a lot less harmful to employment than Econ 101 had suggested. That prompted people to dust off old theories like monopsony power to explain the newly realized facts. The pipeline here was 1) policy entrepreneurship xe2x80x94> 2) empirical studies xe2x80x94> better theory. Not the other way around. I expect Bidenomics to contain a lot of stuff like that. Union policy. Subsidies for care jobs. Various new types of infrastructure. Industrial policies. Competitiveness policies vis-a-vis China. And so on. The three basic pillars I described above are the starting point, but they wonxe2x80x99t be the whole thing. Thatxe2x80x99s going to make a lot of people at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation and the Manhattan Institute and other think tanks that still believe in the old Reagan orthodoxy pull their hair out. Itxe2x80x99s going to ruffle the feathers of some economists who still think theory comes first. Itxe2x80x99s going to worry older Democratic policy advisors who came up during the Age of Reagan and who still instinctively believe in technocratic knob-turning rather than in directly mucking about in the bowels of the economy. And thatxe2x80x99s OK. Itxe2x80x99s good to have a xe2x80x9cloyal oppositionxe2x80x9d that watches and critiques the new paradigm. Sometimes that opposition will be right; like every policy paradigm before it, Bidenomics is going to make some mistakes. That is the price of progress.The key will be making sure the mistakes donxe2x80x99t get too big. Obviously Ixe2x80x99m pretty excited about Bidenomics xe2x80x94 I donxe2x80x99t agree with everything Biden is doing, but overall this has the general contours of the change Ixe2x80x99ve long thought needed to happen. Still, there are some ways the program could fail, and I think itxe2x80x99s important to keep an eye on these as we push ahead. The main ones I can think of are:1) Debt constraints. Biden has shown a much greater willingness than previous Democratic Presidents to borrow and spend, and the exigencies of COVID caused a big bump in government debt. Some people (mostly online meme warriors) believe therexe2x80x99s no constraint on government borrowing, and others believe there are constraints but wexe2x80x99re nowhere near them. I tend to think itxe2x80x99s not much of a problem right now, but I also recognize that the effects of government debt are not well-understood. If bond investors get nervous and long-term interest rates spike, the Fed will have to decide whether to push those rates down. If it does (perhaps concerned that failing to do so would cause government interest costs to spiral out of control), the result could be accelerating inflation. Or not. I donxe2x80x99t know, since I donxe2x80x99t understand the relationship between monetary policy, fiscal policy, and inflation, and I donxe2x80x99t think anyone yet does. But it bears keeping an eye on. 2) Ruinous costs. The U.S. has an excess cost problem in two big industries xe2x80x94 health care (plus child care), and construction. Care work and construction are exactly the two biggest sectors that Biden wants to pump money into. Remember how when we poured all that money into Californiaxe2x80x99s high-speed rail program and it became a giant boondoggle and lots of it got wasted and we didnxe2x80x99t actually get high-speed rail? If that happens with Bidenxe2x80x99s new electrical grid etc., wexe2x80x99re in trouble. And if pumping money into long-term care just makes the cost spiral out of control, it will waste labor and add to our overall health cost problem. Either of those outcomes would depress productivity and growth, leaving a smaller pie to be distributed to the nationxe2x80x99s masses. Thus, in order to make sure we actually get bang for our buck, Biden and his team should focus on identifying and mitigating the sources of excess costs in construction and care, rather than just assuming that throwing more money at these things is enough.There are other dangers, such as higher consumer prices from some of Bidenxe2x80x99s less-well-thought-out industrial policies, but I think theyxe2x80x99re really second-order compared to these big two. Of the two, Ixe2x80x99m much more worried about the second one; excess costs are the big millstone around the neck of the U.S. economy, a looming problem that so far I havenxe2x80x99t seen either Biden or his Republican opposition talk or think much about. But anyway, I donxe2x80x99t want to end on a negative note. Always remember that America needed a new paradigm. Our old one wasnxe2x80x99t working, and economic research and basic data analysis both suggested clear directions for change. There will be missteps and mistakes on the way to change. Many people will resist the changes, some for better reasons than others. But when it comes time to turn the ship, you must turn the ship, and that is what Biden is doing. Letxe2x80x99s see where it goes.ShareFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Bidenomics seems to me as total failure. Creating new jobs with elder care ? It is worse than telling \"learn code\" campaign for miners.  This utter nonsense policy will hurt this country more and open more and more gates for alt-right haters like Trump. I will not be surprised if there will be a republican resurgence in 2024. Please create more high paying manufactring jobs and bring back manufactring jobs back. That is what Biden was promised in election campaign. Ixe2x80x99ll be the first to admit that I xe2x80x98m shocked at Biden, like so many others, I assumed hexe2x80x99d continue with politics as is (aka continuation of Obama). I really didn't expect him to do what he did. But a much more important question is what will happen when Republicans consolidate their hold on the House/Senate and State Houses. The so called minority/majority governance model (aka South Africa) In the short term I expect they will simply block everything the Democrats propose. Longer term is the next presidential election. Will the GOP candidate be a Trump wannabe or even Trump himself or someone who models himself on Brazilian president Jari Bolsonaro. Right on culture wars, left on economic issues. The big unknown is how far state Republicans will go to block the Dems from winning the next presidential election. Scorched earth is what comes to mind.

As long as mass immigration is a good thing for the U.S. anyway, why not use it as a way to bulk up to a size where we can stand toe to toe with our soon-to-be-rival?Now, Matt Yglesias has written an entire book expounding this thesis, and providing a road map for how to bulk America up. It is a very good book, and you should buy it. In this review, Ixe2x80x99ll offer a few thoughts on why the book is good, and where I would have liked to have seen the arguments and ideas fleshed out more. But basically, this is a solid case for much much more immigration, at a time when anti-immigration policy has gotten the upper hand.Mattxe2x80x99s basic pitch is this: China is big, so if the U.S. wants to be as powerful as China, we also need to be big. Americans often seem not to realize, on a deep and visceral level, just how honkinxe2x80x99 big China is. Here is a graph showing the two countriesxe2x80x99 populations in 2020:In terms of population, China is bigger than the U.S., all of Europe, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, and Australia combined.Obviously, any contest of power between the two will also depend on their relative wealth, technology level, government competence, military competence, etc. But China is increasing its wealth and technology level all the time, and the recent COVID-19 episode should give us some information about the two countriesxe2x80x99 government competence (Itxe2x80x99s not all bad news for us; we developed very spiffy vaccines in record time. But itxe2x80x99s mostly bad news for us.). In others words, the advantages that would allow the U.S. to prevail in any sort of contest against China xe2x80x94 military, economic, technological xe2x80x94 are rapidly eroding. And that implies that we should offset our big disadvantage in population, by bulking up.In fact, therexe2x80x99s another reason that population would make America stronger, which Matt doesnxe2x80x99t really go into: Agglomeration effects. Companies are desperate to invest in China because of that huge domestic market. The lure of that market forces them to put up with a lot, such as Chinese IP theft. It also induces them to put factories and offices in China, which creates lots of jobs for Chinese people. And when some companies put their factories and offices in China, it induces other companies to do the same, since they need to be located near to their supply chains xe2x80x94 if the battery makers are in China, it makes sense for the phone makers to be in China too, etc. If the U.S. had a larger population, we could be an even more attractive destination for investment xe2x80x94 we could retake our position as the xe2x80x9ceconomic center of the world.xe2x80x9d That would make us richer as well as cementing our power vis-a-vis China. I would have liked to have seen more of an explanation of agglomeration in the book.OK, but letxe2x80x99s step back. Why are we trying to stand down China at all? Why is this a goal? Is Sweden letting in immigrants to try to balance Germany? Is Bolivia letting in immigrants to try to balance Brazil? And so on. Arenxe2x80x99t international conflicts bad? Arenxe2x80x99t cold wars bad? Can America even claim to be the good guys on the international stage anymore, after Iraq and Trump?Now, I, Noah Smith, can give you answers to this question. I can talk about China threatening the freedom of Taiwan and other countries in the region. I can talk about how America, despite our recent stumbles, still has the DNA of freedom and individual dignity, and can advance these values in the face of a Chinese state that offers people only economic stability at the cost of dignity and freedom. I could talk to you about those things. But Yglesias doesnxe2x80x99t talk about them in this book. And so I feel that he needs to write a follow-up book, to explain why this contest is one we should even enter. The most powerful fact in One Billion Americans is that if the U.S. actually had a population of one billion, it would only be as densely populated as France. A lot of opponents of density talk as if wexe2x80x99d all have to live in little pods and eat bugs. I imagine they think that an America of one billion people would look something like this:But in fact, lots of France just looks like this:A billion Americans would only be three times the number of people we have now. Thatxe2x80x99s a point Yglesias really drives home, and itxe2x80x99s the most powerful part of the book. But I think it could have used some pictures, frankly, to show that France-like density isnxe2x80x99t so bad after all. Just importing a few hundred million people, however, would not automatically make America as picturesque of a country as France. Current land use is based around suburban sprawl, long commutes, polluted freeways, cookie-cutter suburbs, and other bad choices. Much of Yglesiasxe2x80x99 book is dedicated to explaining the nuts and bolts of how we could reshape the U.S. to fit all those new people.Basically this is just a question of urbanism xe2x80x94 land use and transit. We need to create denser neighborhoods that are still livable, while preserving peoplexe2x80x99s ability to get around easily. This is where Yglesiasxe2x80x99 knowledge really shines, as he has been thinking about these issues for literally decades. Hexe2x80x99s an urbanist at heart, and here he returns to his roots.Itxe2x80x99s a little odd to position three chapters of meaty urbanist details about housing and transit and land use at the heart of a book about superpower conflict and visions of Americaxe2x80x99s future, butxe2x80xa6I dig it. I always learn a lot from reading Matt, especially on these topics. Itxe2x80x99s a bit like reading Jared Diamond go on for 100 pages about varieties of domesticable plants xe2x80x94 yes, I showed up to learn how Europe conquered the Americas, but botany is cool too!What I really wished Matt would have done is provide more of a feel for what this densified, immigrant-packed, urbanized America would be like. What kind of house would I live in? How would I get to work? Would I be able to go see nature easily? Who would my neighbors be? Where would I keep my dog? And so on. Vivid wordy descriptions would have been nice xe2x80x94Matt is really a data type of dude rather than a florid essayist xe2x80x94 but I think even more powerful would have been pictures. I want to see what the One Billion America might look like.Would it look like this? Or this?Or maybe this?If wexe2x80x99re going to build a new country, we should be able to imagine it. That vivid vision must be left for another urbanist book.Ultimately, Yglesiasxe2x80x99 book succeeds at what it sets out to do xe2x80x94 it injects an important new idea into the public consciousness. Simply uttering the words xe2x80x9cone billion Americansxe2x80x9d opens up possibilities and vistas that would otherwise go unthought. Itxe2x80x99s a book that expands onexe2x80x99s mind about the possible. But it leaves me wanting more. I want to know what this new, bigger America might look like. I want to know all the benefits we might derive from living in such an America xe2x80x94 not just the power balance with China. I want to feel that vision, taste it, touch it. That would make it something worth not just thinking about, but fighting for as well.In any case, go buy a copy of One Billion Americans if you donxe2x80x99t already have one. Itxe2x80x99s the start of a long overdue conversation about this countryxe2x80x99s destiny.____________________________________________________________________________(By the way, remember that if you like this blog, you can subscribe here!

That's exactly what's necessary, specially with such a counterintuitive idea as this. When it comes down to wages, the women-into-the-labor-force example is IMO perfect, because it's something that SOUNDS as if it should have reduced wages (it was a doubling of the labor force), but saying that it cut wages IN HALF would get anyone to pause and reconsider their priors.Interesting question about what it would look like. I think/hope the shift will basically be that most Americans wonxe2x80x99t live in detached single family homes anymore - but that still leaves plenty of diversity in the housing stock and lifestyle choices.  It would look pretty different across different cities, and there will be a range of densities that people can choose from in each metro area. A lot the growth in suburbs would be xe2x80x9cmissing middlexe2x80x9d housing (as YIMBYs like to call it) which can take many different forms - rowhouses, duplexes, fourplexes, stacked triplexes like Boston). A lot of that new development would be transit-oriented, so suburbs would probably start looking more like Arlington, VA or Bethesda.  Those areas arenxe2x80x99t going to become Manhattan. But the downtowns of smaller cities might become more like Manhattan. Surprising places like Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta are already seeing a lot of high-rise residential construction downtown.

It started with an optimistic post about climate change, and then I wrote a techno-optimist manifesto, and followed that up with a post about why new energy tech might be especially conducive to productivity growth. But Ixe2x80x99m far from the only one writing and talking about this. Herexe2x80x99s a roundup of a few others.This was the only techno-optimist post I saw before I wrote my own, meaning I need to spend more time reading blogs! But itxe2x80x99s a really good one. Watney speculates on a number of areas of technological progress, focusing on vaccines, solar and batteries, lab-grown meat, A.I., self-driving cars, nuclear fusion, and VR. He and I are thinking along very similar tracks here.Cowen wrote the book on the Great Stagnation (years before Robert Gordon did!). But he always suspected that productivity and technological progress would accelerate again. Now, observing a number of obviously important breakthroughs, he writes:Around the time The Great Stagnation came out in 2011, I predicted that it was most likely to end within the next twenty years.  We are not there yet, but that claim is no longer looking so absurd.Ixe2x80x99m pretty sure that it was the COVID vaccine that got us all thinking along techno-optimist lines. Other positive trends like solar and batteries had been going on for years, but the big push of the vaccine effort xe2x80x94 the unprecedented speed and effectiveness, the public-private cooperation, the use of a novel technology (mRNA vaccines) to beat a novel pandemic. It was an inspiring moment.And like many of us, Yglesias was inspired to think about more than just vaccines. He writes:I think itxe2x80x99s clear that if we had to weather this pandemic with the tech of 20 years ago, wexe2x80x99d have had worse public health outcomes and worse economic outcomes. Two decadesxe2x80x99 worth of internet and mobile tech has proven its value, and more good things are to come if this period of experimentation ends up helping to accelerate the development of widely used remote work, telemedicine, and online education modelsxe2x80xa6and[The vaccine is] a proof of concept for the kind of thing we could be doing in the clean energy space. Say an electric car that meets such-and-such specifications would get guaranteed orders to serve as government fleet vehicles. Or pre-commit to buying electric buses for schools and transit agencies. Nuclear micro-reactors for use on military bases or as backup systems for hospitals. The assurance that a market exists is a big stimulus to private investment, and when strong social consensus exists that innovation would be beneficial, we can get it done.Hexe2x80x99s right, of course.The Economist suggests xe2x80x94 reasonably, in my opinion xe2x80x94 that the technologies that boost productivity in the 2020s had their roots in earlier decades of research, and that it simply takes a long time for people to figure out how to use new inventions. They cite Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock & Chad Syversonxe2x80x99s paper xe2x80x9cThe productivity J-curve: How intangibles complement general purpose technologiesxe2x80x9d. That paper argues that big inventions with wide-ranging applications xe2x80x94 electricity, the internal combustion engine, computers, the internet, and maybe A.I. xe2x80x94 initially cause a productivity slowdown, because people are taking time out from production to figure out how to use the new stuff. Once they do, itxe2x80x99s off to the races, and productivity bounces back.The Economist writes:Early evidence suggests that some transformations are very likely to stick, and that the pandemic quickened the pace of technology adoption. A survey of global firms conducted by the World Economic Forum this year found that more than 80% of employers intend to accelerate plans to digitise their processes and provide more opportunities for remote work, while 50% plan to accelerate automation of production tasksxe2x80xa6[T]he boost to distance education and telemedicine delivered by the pandemic could help drive a period of growth in services trade, and the achievement of economies of scale in sectors which have long proved resistant to productivity-boosting measuresxe2x80xa6[T]he raw materials for a new productivity boom appear to be falling into place, in a way not seen for at least two decades. This yearxe2x80x99s darkness may in fact mean that dawn is just over the horizon.Peter Thiel was one of the most prominent techno-pessimists of the 2010s, famously comparing the dream of flying cars with the disappointment of Twitter. Of course, I donxe2x80x99t share Thielxe2x80x99s right-wing politics; quite the opposite. But the fact that hexe2x80x99s decided to become optimistic about progress again is noteworthy. He says:I keep thinking the other side of it is that one should think of Covid and the crisis of this year as this giant watershed moment, where this is the first year of the 21st century. This is the year in which the new economy is actually replacing the old economy.  Many of the new techno-optimists are excited about biotechnologies or the return of energy technology. But some are still excited about software! Hobart is one of these:It is interesting to look at one case where the techno-optimists are right and the stagnationists have explaining to do: the pace of software deployment remains high, and the pace of software advancement appears to be accelerating as products like AlphaFold and GPT-3 let computers do things that previously seemed either a) only possible with human input, or b) not possible at allxe2x80xa6Software automation replaces tedious, low-value added rote work with equally tedious but very high-value added investment in permanent automation, and since software companies are more fundable than service companies, and since they're racing to win market share, this could temporarily push wages up in the jobs that get automated first.As I always say: xe2x80x9cDystopia is when robots take half of your jobs; Utopia is when robots take half of your job.xe2x80x9dMore thoughts from Cowen:I would say that almost certainly the great stagnation is over in the biomedical sciences.  It is less obvious that the great stagnation is over more generally, as we might simply retreat into our former sloth and complacency once we are mostly vaccinatedxe2x80xa6Two more general points seem relevant.  First, many of the biomedical advances seem connected to new platforms, new modes of computation, new uses of AI, and so on, and they should be leading to yet further advances.  Second, there are (finally!) some very real advances in energy use, and those tend to bring yet other advances in their wake, and not just advances in bit space.Dourado lists many of the same technologies listed above, but takes a deeper dive into each one. He adds life extension, construction tech, tunneling, and supersonic flight to the list. In fact I think hexe2x80x99s a little too optimistic about those, at least for the 2020s! But hopefully he is right and I am wrong.He notes that for tech to make it into the productivity numbers, we have to be willing, as a society, to scale them up:One of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling productionxe2x80xa6It all depends on execution. The underlying science is there. The engineers are willing. Even the funding is available in most cases. But, as a society, how much urgency do we feel? Our culture does not prioritize progressxe2x80x94it fights, destructively, for status. And our politics reflects our culture.I want to go faster.It might be that the new techno-optimism is just wishful thinking; after all, we donxe2x80x99t really know what will happen to technology or to productivity. It might be that all of us bloggers are just sitting around huffing each otherxe2x80x99s fantasies; the blogger at Applied Divinity Studies certainly thinks so. In the coming weeks, Ixe2x80x99ll try to answer some of the critiques of techno-optimism, and to provide some perspective on what techno-optimism does and doesnxe2x80x99t mean. Also, call me a woke SJW, but I canxe2x80x99t help but notice that so far the new wave of techno-optimists are, like me, a bunch of white dudes (with the possible exception of the Economist writer). Ixe2x80x99m going to try to track down some techno-optimists (and techno-pessimists!) from other demographics. Ixe2x80x99ll also write about why own my techno-optimism is partly motivated by observing the ways in which past innovations have reduced social inequalities.Anyway, watch this space. Much more to come.____________________________________________________________________________(By the way, remember that if you like this blog, you can subscribe here!

Recently, he went on Julia Galefxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cRationally Speakingxe2x80x9d podcast and discussed this research. Itxe2x80x99s a good interview, and I recommend the whole thing. But Deaton is also a harsh critic of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in development economics, and he also discussed this with Galef. At the end of the podcast, they had this amusing exchange:Julia Galef: Well, I don't know what the people you're complaining about are doing, but I imagine if you're testing a specific intervention -- like giving out anti-malarial bed nets -- the cases in different countries or different regions aren't going to be identical, but it's still pretty similar, what you're doing from one region to the other. You're giving out bed nets. Angus Deaton: I don't agree, because all the side effects, which are the things we're talking about, are going to be different in each case. And also, just to take a case -- we know what reduces poverty, what makes people better off: it's school teachers, it's malaria pills, it's all these things. Julia Galef: How do we know that, though? Angus Deaton: Oh, come on. Julia Galef: No, I'm sorry, that was not a rhetorical or a troll question. Angus Deaton: Really? I don't know how you get out of bed in the morning. How do you know that when you stand up, you won't fall over? I mean, there's been no experiments on that. There's never been an experiment on aspirin. Have you ever taken an aspirin? Julia Galef: So, sorry, you think that increasing the number of schoolteachers -- or paying them better, or some intervention on school teachers causes people to be better off -- that that claim is as obvious as gravity? Angus Deaton: It's pretty obvious. But that's not the point I'm trying to make.  What the heck is Deaton talking about here??First of all, itxe2x80x99s pretty bizarre to say that therexe2x80x99s never been an experiment on aspirin. If I go to PubMed and search for xe2x80x9caspirin randomized controlled trialxe2x80x9d, I get 7,586 results. There are reportedly 700 to 1000 clinical trials conducted on aspirin every year. There were also experiments involved in the invention of aspirin; people knew that salicylic acid helped with headaches, but extracting and buffering the chemical were both non-trivial tasks. OK, but do we really need those experiments to know that aspirin helps get rid of headaches? Thatxe2x80x99s Deatonxe2x80x99s intended point here xe2x80x94 that there are some things you just know will work, because of common sense and accumulated wisdom, and you donxe2x80x99t need a fancy RCT to know theyxe2x80x99ll work. Just do the things that reduce poverty xe2x80x94 provide more school teachers and malaria pills, etc. xe2x80x94 and donxe2x80x99t worry about testing to verify the obvious.But what if itxe2x80x99s not obvious? We know that in general, education reduces poverty. But that doesnxe2x80x99t mean that specific educational interventions reduce poverty xe2x80x94 or that theyxe2x80x99re worth the cost, or that theyxe2x80x99re better than alternatives.For example, as Jason Kerwin pointed out on Twitter, Indonesiaxe2x80x99s experiment with doubling teacher salaries didnxe2x80x99t improve student learning outcomes (and so probably didnxe2x80x99t help much with poverty either). A 2007 study in Tanzania found that xe2x80x9chigh primary enrolment rates in the past did not lead to the realisation of the associated developmental outcomesxe2x80x9d.And Nancy Cartwright, who is Deatonxe2x80x99s co-author on his most famous critique of RCTs, describes how an experiment to double the number of teachers per student in California failed to improve outcomes xe2x80x94 despite having encouraging evidence from an RCT.The point here isnxe2x80x99t that education doesnxe2x80x99t reduce poverty; there are plenty of other cases where it did. The point is that educational programs donxe2x80x99t always work. And empirical research is how you figure out which programs work and which donxe2x80x99t.And no, RCTs donxe2x80x99t always give you the right answer (as the California example demonstrates). To really get a full picture of the evidence you need policy experiments, natural experiments, and so on. But you do need evidence! Simply falling back on our intuition and wisdom when making policy is not enough! One vivid illustration of the inadequacy of intuition and wisdom is that different peoplexe2x80x99s wisdom leads them to very different conclusions. For example, Lant Pritchett, also a renowned development economist and also a harsh critic of RCTs, strongly criticized the awarding of the 2019 Econ Nobel to three development economists who used RCTs to study the effectiveness of antipoverty programs. In a memorable Facebook rant, he declared:Poverty rates across countries are almost perfectly correlated with the \"typical\" (median) income/consumption in that country...If poverty programs are defined as those that improve poverty rates, conditional on the typical level of income in a country, they account for less than 1 percent of total variation in poverty...A commitment to \"study global poverty\" would probably ask:  \"what accounts for the observed reductions (or lack thereof) in poverty across time and across countries?\" and discover that variation in the size and efficacy of poverty programs had little or nothing to do with poverty reduction...So a focus on applying a method to the study of the effectiveness of (mostly) NGO programs is a commitment to not study global poverty. So to Pritchett, RCTs are next to useless, because we know what reduces poverty. Itxe2x80x99s economic growth! And to Deaton, RCTs are next to useless, because we know what reduces poverty. Itxe2x80x99s schoolteachers and malaria pills!Each of these guys believes that we know what reduces poverty, and yet their answers donxe2x80x99t agree. The very kinds of xe2x80x9cNGO programsxe2x80x9d Pritchett dismisses are the things Deaton says are the obvious solution. It would be kind of fun to get these guys in a room and have them hash it out. But the point here is that even among people who are obviously very wise, and have obviously well-developed intuition, answers to big questions like poverty reduction can vary dramatically. This is why we canxe2x80x99t replace empirical evidence with xe2x80x9cOh, come onxe2x80x9d. Even the most erudite and brilliant practitioners get things wrong fairly frequently. Empirical research, at least if done properly, doesnxe2x80x99t rely on any one personxe2x80x99s intuition; itxe2x80x99s a group effort, with large numbers of people checking and rechecking each otherxe2x80x99s work, and holding that work to quantifiable and rigorous standards. The collective intelligence of science is more powerful than the expertise of any sage. This is of course true in medicine as well; the greatest doctors on Earth will swear up and down that theyxe2x80x99ve seen this or that treatment work miracles on their patients, and then RCTs come along and find the cure was no better than a placebo. This pandemic has vividly and cruelly demonstrated the necessity of high-quality evidence when evaluating cures. In any case, Deatonxe2x80x99s critiques of RCTs are good, but the answer is to supplement them with other kinds of careful empirical evidence xe2x80x94 not to simply say xe2x80x9cOh, come onxe2x80x9d and decide that we already know the answers.____________________________________________________________________________(By the way, remember that if you like this blog, you can subscribe here!

It has gone too far no doubt, ignoring a century of accumulated insights on how economies work. But I believe the fault is with the theorists who saturated the journals with unrealistic, degenerate models, for academic merit or for political gaslighting purposes.Hi Noah,I have long enjoyed your blog . This is a topic near to my heart -- I wrote a thesis on the subject back in 2015.I think you correctly summarize the upshot of Deaton and Nancy Cartwright's position. I would just like to clarify some terminology, that may make the critique easier to understand. No one, including Deaton and Cartwright as far as I'm aware, thinks that RCTs are bad tool. In fact, almost everyone thinks they are very good tools for one, specific, task: making causal inferences.The critique is really focused on what you do with causal inferences -- sometimes known in the literature as so-called 'evidence-for-use.' To see the problem, it's helpful to think what an ideal RCT tells you: An ideal RCT gives you an extremely strong evidence that the intervention (whatever form it takes) is the cause of the effect in the model population. What an RCT, however well designed, can never tell you is whether the same intervention will have the same effect in some other population. In order to jump from the inference in the model population to some other target population, you need to extrapolate. (I would emphasize, in passing, here that a target population is *always* distinct from the model population -- the same intervention may have different effects based solely on the time the intervention is administered!) The difficulty is that an RCT -- by design -- does not explain *why* an intervention worked in the model population. All it tells you is that it did work. RCTs, to the extent we want them to do anything more than generate a true causal inference, have to be accompanied by some theory of mechanisms -- a theory that may need only be intuitive, as I understand Deaton to suggest. And this theory must explain why the *reason* the intervention had its effect in the model population can be expected to obtain with respect to some other population. In other words, to turn a causal inference from an RCT into evidence for, e.g., a policy's efficacy in some other (later, more widespread, geographically distinct, whatever) setting, you have to discharge the burden of showing the reason the effect occurred will hold in the target population. To tie this back to reality, it is helpful to think about medicine -- aspirin, to use you example. Consider an RCT showing aspirin is effective in population A. We have reason to think that asprin will be effective in population B (say, all mankind more or less) because we know that the mechanism by which aspirin has its effect in population A will be unaffected by any differences in population B. People are the same in the relevant respects, across space and time. The casual pathway is essentially invariant. (Causal pathway is a term in medicine that development economists should pay greater attention to, in my view.) This assumption is more or less a fair one for the majority of medical interventions and the associated RCTs. The same cannot be said for many RCTs in development economics. Consider deworming children. It may be that a mass deworming program has the effect of better educational outcomes (and associated human capital development) in model population A. But how do we extrapolate that result to other settings? We need to assume that causal pathway, i.e. the mechanism by which the intervention has its effect -- the drug works (okay), school children have fewer parasitic infections (okay), so they have more energy (maybe), are able to attend school earlier (are you sure?) and are more attentive in class (maybe), leading to better educational outcomes -- also obtains in the target population, often in some very different social context. In other words, the causal inference is only useful when it is accompanied by all kinds of other evidence as to whether the causal inference can survive extrapolation. (Please don't take me to be saying deworming is bad. I'm in favour of it, but not because of its affects on human capital accumulation!)So what's the problem? Well in some sense there isn't one. RCTs are great! But they have to be accompanied by careful empirical research, as you say. But ideal (or close to ideal) RCTs are extremely expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, from a policy design perspective, placing RCTs on a pedestal may come at the cost of the other types of research necessary for good usable policies. Institutional demands for RCTs may also restrict funding for plausible evidence-based (but not RCT based!) interventions. There is nothing wrong with experimenting.In my view, extrapolation is the real challenge for RCTs in development economics. It is a problem that medicine doesn't really need to grapple with to the same extent -- but they do. And economists should too.

So Ixe2x80x99m trying to think of something special to give to subscribers in the meantime. And one idea is to do a few more personal posts xe2x80x94 diary-type stuff. Ixe2x80x99m still experimenting, so let me know if this kind of thing isnxe2x80x99t actually that interesting. Sometime in the mid-2010s, my friend Peter invited me over to his sisterxe2x80x99s house. There, I met his brother-in-law Aram Yang, who was working on a battery startup. He and I had similar physics backgrounds, and we immediately hit it off. I was especially interested in his job, because I really felt xe2x80x94 as I still feel xe2x80x94 that batteries are going to save the world. At the time, Aram was feeling a bit frustrated, because his company had hit some snags. But to me, looking from the outside in, he had a kind of life I deeply envied. If I hadnxe2x80x99t gotten clinically depressed and left physics after college, I probably would have gone into clean energy in some form (after realizing that high-energy theory is pretty much mined out, at least for right now). The idea of showing up to work every day, sitting at a lab bench or coding models on a computer, doggedly pursuing the kind of deep breakthroughs that might free humanity from the curse of oilxe2x80xa6that really appealed to me. Instead, I had this weird life talking about economic policy on the internet.But I chose that life because other stuff seemed unsatisfying. In 2005, when I decided to go into economics, I was sitting in my apartment in Japan reading Brad DeLong and Matt Yglesias and wishing I was an economics blogger. I reasoned that any country could have great scientists xe2x80x94 the Soviet Union had had great scientists. What really mattered was policy, because that determined whether the science got squandered or used to increase human flourishing.15 years later, here I am. In some other branch of the multiverse, therexe2x80x99s a Noah Smith sitting at a lab bench figuring out how to make a better cathode, wondering if he should have been an econ blogger instead.So yes, the grass is always greener. But really, the more interesting question about what kind of career held meaning for me. Every time I thought about what I wanted to do, I kept coming back to the same desire: I wanted to make my mark on the world. I wanted to know that something was different and better because I had been on this planet.That sounds like a very common, generic thing to want, but actually itxe2x80x99s very subtle and difficult. To really know you made your mark, you have to think about whether the things you did would have happened anyway without you. If youxe2x80x99re a doctor, and you save 500 peoplexe2x80x99s lives, you have to think: If I hadnxe2x80x99t gone to medical school, would this hospital have hired a doctor who would have saved 501 lives? This kind of thinking inevitably devolves into a sort of internal recapitulation of the debate over the Great Man Theory of History. Except itxe2x80x99s the Great Man Theory of Your Own Life. No wonder people love to just sort of surrender to the Econ 101 dogma of xe2x80x9cwage = marginal productxe2x80x9d, and choose to believe that their paycheck equals their contribution to the world. At least, hedge fund traders do. People who make $30,000 a year with a Cornell degree because they chose to work for a nonprofit helping poor people get access to clean water probably arenxe2x80x99t very enamored of that theory. Bob Barsky, who was on my dissertation committee, used to always warn me against being too grandiose. Of course he meant that with respect to my research questions, but it also seems like a good rule when evaluating your own career. Of course people who chase power and self-importance tend not to be happy; therexe2x80x99s almost always someone more powerful, more important. But maybe just wanting to xe2x80x9cchange the worldxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cleave your markxe2x80x9d is a form of grandiosity as well, because it requires you to be unusual and different and original enough to be able to tell yourself that the world couldnxe2x80x99t have done it without you.When I asked the Japanese economist Masahisa Fujita what to do with my life, back in 2005, he gave me some very interesting advice. xe2x80x9cJust do some stuff,xe2x80x9d he said. Find your way through the world, work on what interests you, live the kind of life you want to lead, and then, later, tell yourself that it all meant something. Maybe the secret to career satisfaction xe2x80x94 or satisfaction with any other piece of life xe2x80x94 is just being able to spin it all into a heroic tale after the fact.Anyway, the reason I was thinking about this is that one of the big technological developments that Ixe2x80x99ve been excitedly blogging about is an announcement of a new, better solid-state battery. The company that developed that battery is called QuantumScape, and one of their senior researchers isxe2x80xa6my friendxe2x80x99s brother-in-law, Aram. Their batteries still arenxe2x80x99t in mass production, and they have plenty of competition, but things are definitely looking good.Thatxe2x80x99s pretty awesome, isnxe2x80x99t it? I guess some people would look at that and think xe2x80x9cThat could have been me; I could have been the one to do that.xe2x80x9d But I donxe2x80x99t. To be honest, Ixe2x80x99m just glad somebody did it. Ixe2x80x99ll do something else!

And it has long been a dream of mine to see Texas become one of Americaxe2x80x99s premier technology hubs. So Ixe2x80x99m pretty happy to report that this might actually happen now.Oracle has moved its headquarters from Redwood City to Austin. Elon Musk is moving to Texas after investing heavily in the state via both SpaceX and Tesla. HP is moving to Houston after investing heavily there for a while. A few venture capitalists and a number of smaller companies are making the move as well. Anecdotally, several of my friends in the VC/tech world are relocating from SF to Austin.Texas has been trying to become the countryxe2x80x99s technology hub for years. The state government is very pro-development (a xe2x80x9cdevelopment statexe2x80x9d, if you will, heh), and all the leaders know that the age of oil is ending and the economy must diversify. In fact, this effort dates back to the 70s, when the first oil bust hit Texas hard. Thatxe2x80x99s when a consultant named Pike Powers teamed up with a bunch of university, government, and industry leaders to try to lure big tech companies to Austin. If you want to read about how he did it, I recommend his essay xe2x80x9cBuilding the Austin Technology Cluster: The Role of Government & Community Collaboration in the Human Capitalxe2x80x9d. Basically, in addition to the usual mix of infrastructure, cheap land, and tax incentives, they tried to make Austin attractive to smart young people, by publicizing and promoting the cityxe2x80x99s culture of weirdness, and fun. That culture, immortalized in the movie Slacker, was inevitably diluted by the new arrivals xe2x80x94 such is the tradeoff of building a town into a big city. SXSW turned from a music festival into a startup fair; oh well. But a bit of that culture remains, and if you have a chance, I recommend spending some time in Austin.Meanwhile, Houston is a VERY underrated city, and is changing fast; something I plan to write more about.But anyway, despite attracting a lot of tech company offices and building up a robust workforce of engineers, Austin failed to become a startup hub on the level of Silicon Valley. My Bloomberg colleague Justin Fox has a great post from 2018 showing how Texas still lags its West Coast rivals in VC funding, startups, and some high-value segments of the tech industry like cloud computing. But that could always change. Texasxe2x80x99 lack of state income OR capital gains taxes mean that startup founders stand to gain a lot of money from living there. Texas also has much cheaper housing xe2x80x94 as of 2016, the rent per square foot of housing in Austin was less than 1/3 of what it is in San Francisco. And itxe2x80x99s not like California has great public transit to make up for that. Meanwhile, the political climate in SF and many nearby towns has become increasingly frosty toward tech companies, blaming them for bringing in workers that pushed up rents.So, Texas.Now the question is whether this Texodus will be enough to build Texas xe2x80x94 or Austin, specifically xe2x80x94 into a tech supercluster to rival the Bay Area or Seattle. To make a tech cluster, you basically need four things:A lot of engineersSome big tech companiesVenture capitalStartupsThe key to clustering effects is that each one of these players gets something from the presence of each of the others. I made a little diagram in Microsoft Paint to illustrate this web of relationships:Engineers are the most important, since they provide the workforce for big companies and they also start their own companies. Big companies employ tons of engineers, so you need them in the area. But of course you also need the VCs. For some reason, VCs are one of the most localized industries, preferring to be physically close to the companies they found. This is the piece that Pike Powers and the Austin boosters of the 70s and 80s largely missed. So thatxe2x80x99s why itxe2x80x99s important that a trickle of VCs is now moving to Texas. For Austin (or Texas in general) to truly ascend to the top tier of clusters, it needs that trickle to become a flood. The other piece of this is to make sure that Texas housing stays cheap. Here Texas has two big disadvantages xe2x80x94 everyone likes single-family homes, and cities donxe2x80x99t like public transit. That will make density hard, maybe even harder than in SF. But Texas also has a few big advantages. First, Texas cities really sprawl xe2x80x94 Austin is 271 square miles compared to San Franciscoxe2x80x99s 47, despite the fact that the two have roughly similar populations. Second, Texas cities tend to incorporate many more of their suburbs xe2x80x94 the city of San Francisco only 18% of its metro area population, while Austin has more than 43% and Houston has 33%. That lets Texas cities avoid some of the toxic local politics of the Bay Area, where fragmentation of city governments creates a coordination problem where each little town wants to keep out the poor people by not building housing. Texas also has no Prop 13, and less restrictive zoning codes.So therexe2x80x99s a chance that Texas might be able to keep rents reasonable even with an influx of tech workers. If it can do those two things xe2x80x94 lure in venture capital firms, while continuing to keep land cheap xe2x80x94 Texas has a real shot at stealing a chunk of the tech industry from California. And if San Francisco and other Bay Area cities find themselves with less tax revenue when tech companies start to move out xe2x80x94 well, thatxe2x80x99s the choice they made! Thatxe2x80x99s why we have states in the first place.____________________________________________________________________________(By the way, remember that if you like this blog, you can subscribe here!

I have lived in New York, Toronto, the SF Bay Area, Tokyo, etc.    I would certainly consider Austin Texas if I didnxe2x80x99t have family obligations and the opportunity was the right one (I have interviewed before with Texas companies but never found a fit).  Austin has a lot going for it and has a good startup scene.   Two main problems:   A) utterly batshit insane toxic state level politics far beyond anything California local nuttiness could ever muster.  Seriously, I canxe2x80x99t think of anyone that would want to live in a place where Paxton could be governor.  The COVID response has been a joke.  The revisionist history in the schools mean that no one with sense will want their kids to be educated there.   It will take a lot of people to jump ship together for a REALLY good opportunity to get past this.  B) startups are the main attractive thing.  For tech workers, there is Big Tech (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft), there are startups, and there is Everyone Else.   Tesla or SpaceX as they grow in Texas is a good start but I donxe2x80x99t see them focused on attracting talent to move there yet.IBM, HP, Oracle, and Dell are dinosaurs, they donxe2x80x99t really attract talent.   Startups do but donxe2x80x99t bring the state revenue.  Big Tech needs to make more moves into Texas (and attract people to move there) for tech workers to want to move there.    Non-compete clauses are enforceable in Texas. They arenxe2x80x99t in California.

Many of us have, in the back of our minds, a similar vision xe2x80x94 the xe2x80x9cJetsons futurexe2x80x9d, with flying cars and robot housekeepers. But for the past few decades, this future vision has seemed like an anachronism. In the 70s, innovation shifted toward information technology. What had seemed like a constant march toward faster transportation and more useful appliances broke down. When technologists grouse about flying cars or writers ask where our hoverboards are,  theyxe2x80x99re really talking about the stagnation in physical technology, and the shift in innovation from xe2x80x9catomsxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9cbitsxe2x80x9d. Instead of the Jetsons future, we got the cyberpunk future.Why did that happen? One potential answer is xe2x80x9cregulationxe2x80x9d. But while building codes undoubtedly kept us from building as many gleaming Jetsons towers as we might have liked, regulation wasnxe2x80x99t powerful enough to stop us from sprawling out into the exurbs or doubling floor space per person. And the productivity slowdown was global; other countries got bullet trains, but they didnxe2x80x99t get flying cars or robot housekeepers.Instead, I blame the slowdown in energy technology. In 1700, humanity got its energy from human muscle power, from animals, and from burning wood (and occasionally from wind and water). In the 19th century we switched to coal, which was much cheaper, more plentiful, more energy-dense, and easier to extract energy from than those traditional sources. Then in the 20th century we upgraded to oil, which was superior in all of these categories. After World War 2, a global extraction regime and price controls allowed us to keep cheap oil flowing. That ended with the Oil Shocks of the 70s. And though oil became cheaper again in the 80s and 90s, it never attained its former lows, or its low volatility. Then in the 00s it got expensive again.But whatxe2x80x99s even more important is whatxe2x80x99s not shown on this graph xe2x80x94 the fact that we didnxe2x80x99t get anything better than oil during this time. Nuclear fission provided a bit of a boost to electricity generation (and a big boost in France), but nobody ended up driving fission cars around or flying fission planes through the sky (probably for the best). And even setting safety and security concerns aside, fission plants were always difficult to build because they required massive up-front financing that only government could provide in practice. As a result of expensive energy, we started using less. Here, via NPR, is a graph of U.S. energy consumption per capita. Notice when it hits a ceiling.More expensive energy makes physical innovation harder in every way. You need electricity to run your washer, your dryer, your heater, your air conditioner, your oven, your stove xe2x80x94 and many other newfangled appliances innovators might want to sell to you in the future. And oil is responsible for powering cars, trucks, ships, planes etc., not to mention backhoes, bullzoders, and cranes. And lots of manufacturing is very energy-intensive. Without ever-cheaper sources of energy, physical innovation is certainly still possible, but it just gets harder.This stagnation in energy technology almost certainly contributed to the productivity slowdown of the 1970s. The economist William Norhaus wrote a paper in 2004 breaking down productivity growth by industry, and looking at the timing relative to the oil shocks of the 70s. He concluded:The major result of this study is that the productivity slowdown of the 1970s has survived three decades of scrutiny, conceptual refinements, and data revisions. The slowdown was primarily centered in those sectors that were most energy-intensive, were hardest hit by the energy shocks of the 1970s, and therefore had large output declines. In a sense, the energy shocks were the earthquake, and the industries with the largest slowdown were near the epicenter of the tectonic shifts in the economy.The next big question, then, is why xe2x80x9cbitsxe2x80x9d innovation xe2x80x94 computers, software, the internet, etc. xe2x80x94 didnxe2x80x99t fully replace cheap energy in terms of driving productivity growth. In fact, itxe2x80x99s widely accepted that IT did drive the re-acceleration of productivity that began in the late 80s and continued through the early 00s. Economists John Fernald and Shanthi Ramnath find that this surge was basically all IT-driven:Industry-level data show a broad productivity resurgence that reflects both the production and the use of IT. The most IT-intensive industries experienced significantly larger productivity gains than other industries and a wide variety of econometric tests show a strong correlation between IT capital accumulation and labor productivityxe2x80xa6.[We] show that virtually all of the aggregate productivity acceleration can be traced to the industries that either produce IT or use IT most intensively, with essentially no contribution from the remaining industries that are less involved in the IT revolution.And that makes sense. Computerization and online communication allows plenty of production processes, supply chains, and office work to be rationalized and made more efficient. And IT creates lots of new products that people want, like Instagram and iPhones and video games. But around 2005 xe2x80x94 years before the housing bust and the Great Recession xe2x80x94 that productivity growth faded. Productivity didnxe2x80x99t fall all the way back to the crawling pace of the 70s and early 80s, but it did slow substantially. Some have argued that digital services are substantially undervalued in our economic production statistics. Free services generate consumer benefits without showing up in GDP, because GDP doesnxe2x80x99t measure the value of leisure time. This would be similar to what happens in health care, where improvements in health donxe2x80x99t show up in the amount of money people spend on care, and thus tend not to get recorded in productivity. But research by economist Chad Syverson suggests that this omission isnxe2x80x99t nearly big enough to account for the post-2004 productivity slowdown. Another possibility is that xe2x80x9catomsxe2x80x9d innovation, unlike xe2x80x9cbitsxe2x80x9d innovation, unlocks the potential for more extensive growth; instead of simply making us more efficient or more creative at using resources, physical innovation may allow us to gobble up more of the world around us. (As Tyler Cowen and Ben Southwood put it, xe2x80x9cmany scientific advances work through enabling a greater supply of labor, capital, and land, and those advances will be undervalued by a TFP metricxe2x80x9d). A 2013 retrospective on productivity growth by Robert Shackleton of the Congressional Budget Office suggested:Finally, the sweep of the 20th century underlines the extent to which long-term TFP growth and economic growth in general have been influenced by the development of energy and transportation infrastructure suited to the expansion of suburbs.A third possibility is that physical technology is less xe2x80x9cskill-biasedxe2x80x9d than IT, meaning that pretty much anyone can be a factory worker but only a few people can use computers productively and effectively. But therexe2x80x99s some evidence against this theory too. A fourth possibility is that IT simply touches less of our lives than energy does. Sure, lots of appliances run software now, and every business runs using the internet, but every physical object requires energy to make. Electricity and internal combustion might have just been even more general-purpose technologies than computers and software.And there could be other reasons. Itxe2x80x99s well-known that computers and electricity both took a while to show up in the productivity statistics, as businesses learned how to use them effectively. The chain of transmission between technological innovation and productivity just isnxe2x80x99t well-understood.So it remains a mystery. But for whatever reason, xe2x80x9cbitsxe2x80x9d innovation sometimes drives fast productivity growth, and sometimes doesnxe2x80x99t. Even when itxe2x80x99s changing the way we live and work, or altering the politics of whole societies, IT innovation doesnxe2x80x99t always raise our material standards of living at a rapid clip. Of course, that might change soon. Syverson, Erik Brynjolfsson, and Daniel Rock predict that artificial intelligence will supercharge another bump in productivity in the years to come. That will be awesome if it happens.But in the meantime, Ixe2x80x99m even more optimistic about the productivity benefits of an entirely different technological revolution: New rapid progress in energy technology.The cost declines in solar and batteries xe2x80x94 and to a lesser extent, in wind and other storage technologies xe2x80x94 comprise a true technological revolution. Once again, I shall post the amazing graphs:And therexe2x80x99s no end in sight to this revolution. New fundamental advances like solid state lithium-ion batteries and next-generation solar cells seem within reach, which will kick off another virtuous cycle of deployment, learning curves, and cost decreases. These technologies will, of course, make it far easier to fight climate change. And that itself is a form of future productivity, since climate change will probably cause big productivity losses if we donxe2x80x99t stop it. Also, the fact that solar and batteries are a far less finite resource than fossil fuels mean that they will allow industrial society to be sustained for much longer xe2x80x94 another form of future productivity growth.But in addition to these future benefits, renewables and storage will do something else xe2x80x94 something big. For the first time since the advent of oil, humanity might get a new source of cheaper, more plentiful energy. And that has the potential to drive productivity growth of the kind wexe2x80x99ve only rarely seen since the 1960s.With solar and wind now cheaper than fossil fuels in many areas, and still plunging in price, electricity is going to get cheaper. Thatxe2x80x99s going to enable a lot of cool things. For example, cheap, clean large-scale desalination. This would avert the fresh water shortages that loom over much of the world, and allow improvements in agriculture as well.Home appliances will also be easier to power; lots of people will be able to afford clothes dryers, air conditioning, and so on. Plenty of manufacturing industries use a lot of electricity; these will be able to produce more with the same amount of labor, so workers' wages will go up. Construction will become more efficient, allowing the cheap creation of denser suburbs (or more Jetsons towers, if we want them). Recycling, renovating buildings, cleaning up pollution, and all kinds of environmental work will get more affordable. Even the IT industry will benefit, since server farms will be able to do the worldxe2x80x99s computing cheaply and cleanly. They can even mine more cryptocurrency. Coupled with cheap, energy-dense batteries, even more possibilities open up. No one wants to run a gasoline-powered robot housekeeper inside their home, but a battery-powered one would be fine. Better batteries would make electric cars quick and easy to charge and give them long range. Electric flight and electric shipping might make global trade and travel not just more environmentally friendly but actually cheaper. Drones will get much better too (though you can bet these will be used for military purposes as well as civilian ones). Even flying cars might become electric at some point.And nearly every one of these benefits is complementary to human brain power xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s just as easy to drive an electric truck as a gas-powered one.  That means energy tech wonxe2x80x99t make workers worried about being replaced, like A.I. does. In fact, with the right institutions in place to make sure the productivity gains are shared equally, energy tech could reduce inequality. Of course, just as in the industrial revolution, the human world will have to make reforms and compromises and bold changes in order to take advantage of the revolution in energy technology. Building the suburbs was easy; allowing them to be rebuilt in a denser fashion will be politically harder. Faster transportation, new appliances, and improved industrial processes will always require their share of regulation, while increased resource use will have to be managed with care. Cheap energy doesnxe2x80x99t free the rest of society from the burden of smart rule-making. But it does grease the wheels of prosperity. One of the scariest scenarios for the 21st century is that of a zero-sum world, where low productivity growth convinces people that the only way to get rich is at someone elsexe2x80x99s expense. That sort of dog-eat-dog world would see intensified conflict and political instability. But cheap energy, even more than other kinds of innovation, offers the potential for the world to return to the sort of positive, future-oriented, growth-oriented, win-win culture that we sometimes managed to achieve, in some places, during the 20th century.Itxe2x80x99s the future we thought we had lost, but which we might finally get after all.____________________________________________________________________________(By the way, remember that if you like this blog, you can subscribe here!

The \"Jetsons\" will get here sooner or later.  In the meantime some perspective is in order.  200 years ago people used garderobes, if they were lucky, to relieve themseives or chamber pots if they were not.When my mother was born in rural Cardston, Alberta, Canada, in 1912, because they did not have a car they used a horse and buggy to get into town.  Oil lamps or candles provided light.  In the 1930s mom was quite daring going up in a barnstormer's biplane aircraft.  When she was 57 we put a man on the moon.  This was after the world put its economy on hold for the Great Depression of the 30s and World War 2.When I went to work after graduate school as a management analyst working for Clark County, Nevada, in 1974, my main tool for helping do the county budget was an electromechanical adding machine, which through a set of electrically driven gears could be compelled to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, although it could take some seconds to get a result if you wanted to multiply or divide.  My machine showed an inventory price of $995 when it was purchased new in 1965.The reason why a \"Jetson's\" style future did not arrive in the 1970s or 1980s is that certain necessary predicates did not exist.  Although much progress had been made, and we had abundent power, we did not have the capability to produce viable robotics that could do the complicated tasks that futurists predicted.  The \"bit\" revolution was a necessary predicate to all future advances.  Otherwise, we would still be using my electromechanical calculator.  In fact the \"bit\" revolution has been absolutely necessary for the solar revolution this article predicts.  (Which I do so hopefully look forward to, although it is not certain to happen in my lifetime.)My mom had a saying she kept on her desk at work.  \"All things come to he who waiteth so long as he who waiteth worketh like hell while he waiteth.\"  When all the nessary predicates are fulfilled the futurist's future will be upon us, but not a moment before.I wonder why the electricity is so high in Ca, though. Oregon has much lower rates and Ca uses more renewables. Is there a sort of transition we need to go through to get there?Reading this and what you posted  previously on twitter, the one chart you have showing reduced solar and wind  prices, have got me thinking about getting an electric car. If it had a long enough range and I could easily recharge it on a long  trip I would. It just kinda feels like we have a big  hump  to get over somehow.

Oh waitxe2x80xa6this is that blog post.When you hear the words xe2x80x9chomogeneous societyxe2x80x9d uttered in conversation in America, people are almost always talking about either Scandinavia or Japan. To some on the Right, Japan is a paradise of racial purity, while to some on the Left, itxe2x80x99s a bastion of xenophobia and isolationism. The one thing they agree on is that pretty much everyone in Japan is Japanese, and that the government is intent on keeping it that way. So are they right? Well, Ixe2x80x99m going to restrain my impulse to say xe2x80x9cNO, YOUxe2x80x99RE ALL WRONG, YOU FOOLS, YOU DONxe2x80x99T UNDERSTAND JAPAN AT ALL,xe2x80x9d because it actually is an interesting and rather subtle question. It depends on what xe2x80x9chomogeneityxe2x80x9d means, both to us Americans and to Japanese people themselves. And that leads to some interesting questions about identity, nationhood, and public policy. BUT, before asking those questions, we need to get some facts.One of the most common statistics I hear in these discussions is that Japan is xe2x80x9c98% Japanesexe2x80x9d. In fact, the 2018 Census did report that 97.8% of the population is xe2x80x9cJapanesexe2x80x9d. (Though itxe2x80x99s noteworthy that this is down from the traditional xe2x80x9c99%xe2x80x9d.)But what most people donxe2x80x99t seem to understand is that xe2x80x9cJapanesexe2x80x9d here means xe2x80x9ccitizen of the country of Japanxe2x80x9d. It is not a measure of race or ethnicity. It includes native-born citizens of minority races, plus naturalized citizens. The equivalent number for the United States is 93.3%.If I told you that the U.S. was xe2x80x9c93.3% Americanxe2x80x9d, would you conclude that the U.S. is a homogeneous country? Because thatxe2x80x99s exactly what everyone who cites the xe2x80x9c98% Japanesexe2x80x9d statistic is doing for Japan.OK, so how much of Japan is ethnically Japanese? Well, first of all, the ethnicity we casually refer to as xe2x80x9cJapanesexe2x80x9d is formally known as xe2x80x9cYamatoxe2x80x9d. And as for the percent of Japan thatxe2x80x99s Yamato ethnicity, we donxe2x80x99t actually know that, because the government doesnxe2x80x99t keep track.Yep, you read that right. Japanxe2x80x99s government doesnxe2x80x99t go around asking people what race they are. A curious behavior for a country thatxe2x80x99s supposedly obsessed with racial purity, no? Wexe2x80x99ll come back to that in a bitxe2x80xa6Anyway, there are probably some high-quality private-company surveys on ethnic self-identification in Japan, but I donxe2x80x99t have them right now. I will try to track them down. In the meantime, various sources put the Yamato percentage at around 90% or a bit higher. Thatxe2x80x99s pretty high xe2x80x94 about the same as the percent of Americans who identified as xe2x80x9cwhitexe2x80x9d in 1950. But even includes people of mixed ancestry (like one of the anime characters depicted in the image at the top of this post). And since marriage is a significant way that non-Yamato people immigrate to Japan, the percentage of Japanese people who are descended purely from self-identified Yamato people is going to be even lower than 90%.And of course these percentages donxe2x80x99t take local variation into account. In 2018, 1 out of 8 people coming of age (i.e. turning 20) in the city of Tokyo was foreign-born, a figure that doesnxe2x80x99t include ethnic minorities or people of mixed ancestry. Add that to the massive pre-COVID tourism boom, and Japanxe2x80x99s capital city definitely no longer feels very homogeneous. Western tourists who go to Japan often feel like theyxe2x80x99re in a homogeneous country, because they look around and everyone looks East Asian. In fact, in recent years, lots of the people theyxe2x80x99re seeing were actually Chinese tourists, who swamped Japanese cities before COVID-19 struck. And given that they canxe2x80x99t even tell tourists from locals, it is highly unlikely that Westerners walking down the streets of Tokyo, looking around and saying xe2x80x9cHmm, everyone here looks Japanese to mexe2x80x9d are capable of identifying residents of Korean, Chinese, or Brazilian descent.And indeed, in Western society, ethnic distinctions within racial minority groups like xe2x80x9cEast Asiansxe2x80x9d are often glossed over. But in Japan these differences are real and salient. The hate groups who marched through ethnically Korean neighborhoods in the early 2010s with signs saying xe2x80x9cDeath to Koreansxe2x80x9d definitely see a distinction. Brazilian residents are actually mostly of Japanese descent xe2x80x94 they look as Asian as anyone xe2x80x94 but are treated as a separate ethnicity and often face discrimination. And so on.So even if Americans wouldnxe2x80x99t recognize a group distinction walking down the street, these distinctions are important in Japanese society. In other words, the ethnic diversity that Japanese people experience is greater than the diversity that outsiders ascribe to the country.In 2005, then-Foreign Minister Taro Aso declared that Japan was a country of xe2x80x9cone nation, one civilization, one language, one culture and one racexe2x80x9d. He was not the first Japanese politician to use those terms. Given the data above, itxe2x80x99s obvious that this was an aspirational statement rather than a factual one xe2x80x94 a call for Japanese people to think of their country this way. It was a desire to create homogeneity out of diversity, through cultural and linguistic assimilation and through identification with the Japanese nation. In fact, this sentiment is probably one big reason why the Japanese government doesnxe2x80x99t ask citizens about their ethnicity xe2x80x94 it wants them to think of themselves as all being Japanese.In fact, this impulse toward homogeneity doesnxe2x80x99t just work at the level of nationhood, but in terms of ethnicity as well. Just as many Americans whose ancestors have been in the country for a long time come to identify as xe2x80x9cwhitexe2x80x9d, Japanese people whose ancestors have lived in Japan for a while come to identify as xe2x80x9cYamatoxe2x80x9d. Race and nationhood are even more intertwined in Japan than in the U.S. The minorities that exist xe2x80x94 Koreans, Brazilians, and so on xe2x80x94 are generally excluded based on citizenship status rather than linguistic or physical differences. Japan doesnxe2x80x99t have birthright citizenship, so many native-born residents of Japan, who speak no language other than Japanese, hold foreign passports.This is how Japan tends toward homogeneity as time goes on. Zainichi Koreans, Japanxe2x80x99s largest and most prominent minority, have been steadily becoming Japanese through intermarriage and naturalization.Of course, herexe2x80x99s where visual distinctiveness does end up mattering. If a guy who looks like Masayoshi Son tells you hexe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cJapanesexe2x80x9d, itxe2x80x99s pretty easy to just accept that as fact. In fact, Son IS a Japanese citizen, and the only reason people think of him as being part of the Korean minority is that hexe2x80x99s famous enough that the media looked up and reported his ancestry.But for someone like Ariana Miyamoto, itxe2x80x99s a lot harder for some Japanese people to accept that shexe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cJapanesexe2x80x9d. In fact, when Miyamoto won the Miss Universe beauty pageant in 2015, there was a ferocious racist backlash, leading other Japanese people to jump in and defend her. In other words, the rise of visually distinctive Japanese nationals is now forcing Japan to struggle with some of the same issues of appearance, race, identity, and nationhood that other rich nations are now dealing with. For a good in-depth coverage of these issues and struggles, I recommend the 2013 documentary xe2x80x9cHafu: The Mixed-Race Experience in Japanxe2x80x9d. Encouragingly, racial exclusion seems to be losing the debate in Japan for now, as evidenced by the far smaller backlash against Japanxe2x80x99s second mixed-race beauty queen, Priyanka Yoshikawa.Japan is not an island of racial purity. Instead, it is a fairly normal rich country, dealing with fairly normal issues of immigration, diversity, minority rights, racism, and nationhood. A lot of these debates look similar to those in Europe or the U.S., such as when Nike ran an ad in Japan featuring the bullying of minorities, and encountered a mixed reaction.Japanxe2x80x99s distinctiveness in these areas is relatively minor. The country was late to get in on the immigration trend, but finally started opening up under Prime Minster Shinzo Abe in 2013:Japanxe2x80x99s dogged pursuit of homogeneity through nationalism and assimilation is also not particularly unusual xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s much less heavy-handed than Denmark or France in this regard, or even than the U.S. in the early 20th century. The refusal to gather statistics on ethno-racial diversity is unusual (UPDATE: Turns out France is the same!), but it remains to be seen whether simply having statistical agencies ignore diversity will produce greater homogeneity over time.Whether Japanxe2x80x99s leaders will continue to seek homogeneity, or embrace some form of multiculturalism, remains an open question. And itxe2x80x99s also not clear who Japanese people will continue to think of as a minority, or how Japanese racial and national identity will be conceived of in the future. But what should be clear is that Japan is a lot less unusual in these dimensions than many Westerners believe.____________________________________________________________________________(By the way, remember that if you like this blog, you can subscribe here!

Ixe2x80x99m a quarter Japanese and 3/4 Taiwanese but was born and grew up in Japan, only speaking Japanese and knowing its culture. Our family naturalized when I was little so no one knew I wasnxe2x80x99t Japanese. But I never felt I was fully accepted which caused pain when young, even though I never experienced direct discrimination.  Itxe2x80x99s not just about ancestry or how you look in Japan... itxe2x80x99s about how much you accept being Japanese and never question anything to disrupt the harmony. Many of my cousins had no problem assimilating. This is why I donxe2x80x99t find it odd that Japanese government doesnxe2x80x99t collect data about race. Whatxe2x80x99s important is the xe2x80x9cnori,xe2x80x9d going with the flow. If you behave in complete harmony, they tend to accept you no matter how you look. I couldnxe2x80x99t, and thatxe2x80x99s why Ixe2x80x99m American now. i know this isn't a genetics piece, but let me add my gene-sense1) the yamato ppl are a mix of rice farmers + post-jomon hunter-gatherers2) the average is 80-90% of the former with 20-10% latter3) there is a bit of variation in japan, but not much. more post-jomon in the far northeast and in southern kyushu (toward okinawa).if we could get a 'random sample' of ppl from japan we could actually estimate ancestry from other groups pretty well (koreans pop out of japanese samples for example)No posts","title":"How homogeneous is Japan? - Noahpinion","url":"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/how-homogeneous-is-japan"}

No matter how many you shoot down, they just keep coming. So you have to just keep shooting. Casey Mulligan and Stephen Moore are two economists who will never, ever give up the idea that when government gives people anything, for any reason, it kills jobs. Moore, a one-time Trump advisor, has made a name for himself by simply repeating that tax cuts help the economy. In the service of this claim, hexe2x80x99s made a list of howlers so long itxe2x80x99s hard to identify them all. Mulligan wrote a book called xe2x80x9cThe Redistribution Recessionxe2x80x9d, claiming that food stamps, unemployment insurance, and Medicaid were a major reason for the Great Recession xe2x80x94 in other words, that unemployment was high because people were taking a government-sponsored vacation. In 2014, he predicted that Obamacare would lead to a substantial decrease in full-time employment relative to part-time employment. That prediction didnxe2x80x99t exactly work out, as a glance at the ratio of full-time to part-time workers will show:Anyway, I could go on rehashing the past all day, but the point is, itxe2x80x99s not even one tiny bit surprising to see Mulligan and Moore claim, in the pages of the Wall Street Journal, that Pandemic UI killed millions of jobs. Pandemic UI, remember, was the $600/week extra unemployment benefit that Steve Mnuchin and Congress worked to create back at the end of March as part of the CARES Act. That program is widely credited with helping to decrease poverty and boost consumption during the early stages of the pandemic.But Mulligan and Moore write:In July we warned on these pages that six more months of $600-a-week bonus unemployment benefits would keep millions of Americans out of the workforce...President Trump didnxe2x80x99t fully suspend bonus benefitsxe2x80x94which would have been optimal for job growthxe2x80x94but he did cut them to $300 a week. Americans subsequently rushed to fill jobs and the unemployment rate fall rapidly...We estimate that Mr. Trump saved between three million and five million jobs by refusing to cave in to Democratic demands for six more months of supplemental benefits.Thatxe2x80x99s a startling claim, given that employment increased after Pandemic UI was passed, and that the rate of increase slowed after Pandemic UI expired:But of course, itxe2x80x99s technically possible that without Pandemic UI, employment would have increased by even more from April through July, and that if Pandemic UI had continued, employment would have fallen again in August. This is insanely unlikely, but we canxe2x80x99t rule it out just by looking at this one graph! So letxe2x80x99s look at some more detailed evidence.First, therexe2x80x99s this paper by Altonji et al. from late July, which uses private employment data along with individual differences in the percent of a workerxe2x80x99s wages that Pandemic UI replaced (called the xe2x80x9creplacement ratexe2x80x9d), in order to measure the effect of Pandemic UI on employment. Their results are unambiguous:We test whether changes in UI benefit generosity are associated with decreased employment, both at the onset of the benefits expansion and as businesses look to reopen. We use weekly data from Homebase, a private firm that provides scheduling and time clock software to small businesses, which allows us to exploit high-frequency changes in state and federal policies to understand how firms and workers respond to policy changes in real time. Additionally, we benchmark our results from the Homebase data to employment outcomes in the Current Population Survey (CPS). We find that that the workers who experienced larger increases in UI generosity did not experience larger declines in employment when the benefits expansion went into effect. Additionally, we find that workers facing larger expansions in UI benefits have returned to their previous jobs over time at similar rates as others. We find no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work either at the onset of the expansion or as firms looked to return to business over time.(emphasis mine)Other papers by Bartik et al. and Dube et al., using different data sources, find exactly the same result. And Ernie Tedeschi has a research note finding the same.OK, so what evidence do Mulligan and Moore have to counter this mountain of careful empirical evidence? Their only actual piece of data is the fact that job openings fell during Pandemic UI and rose after Pandemic UI expired:Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that from May through Julyxe2x80x94when unemployment benefits were highxe2x80x94job openings surged. As the Journal reported, employers complained they were having trouble rehiring workers. Once the high benefits expired in August, job openings fell for the first time since the start of the pandemic. This certainly wasnxe2x80x99t because the economy was faltering. Third-quarter gross domestic product surged at a 33% annualized rate.But it makes no sense to look at job openings without actually looking at employment. Mulligan and Moore note that job openings fell in August, but looking at the graph of employment above, itxe2x80x99s obvious that the fall was NOT because employment surged! In other words, job openings didnxe2x80x99t fall because a bunch of people became willing to work after Pandemic UI was cut off; they fell for some other reason. As for the increase in job openings under Pandemic UI, the story is not quite what Mulligan and Moore claim. Pandemic UI went into effect at the end of March and job openings continued to plunge in April. Here, from a paper by Marinescu et al., is a picture of job vacancy postings using high-frequency private data:The timing of the increase in vacancies xe2x80x94 which began in mid-May, over a month after Pandemic UI started xe2x80x94 just doesnxe2x80x99t like up with Mulligan and Moorexe2x80x99s story.Marinescu et al. also look at applications per vacancy xe2x80x94 in other words, how hard people are trying to get jobs. If Mulligan and Moore were right, this number would go DOWN under Pandemic UI, due to people being less willing to work. Instead, Marinescu et al. find that it went UP:In other words, under Pandemic UI, Americans actually tried harder to get jobs. So there are at least four careful, high-quality academic papers that just blow Mulligan and Moorexe2x80x99s argument right out of the water. What scraps of evidence they muster are not the kind of thing required to prove their case, and donxe2x80x99t even fit their story anyway.Mulligan and Moore are just wrong.At this point a few of you might be asking: How the heck could they be wrong? How can you pay people not to work, and pay them more than theyxe2x80x99d earn at a job, and NOT see workers drop out of the workforce and take the checks instead?The best answer comes from this paper by Boar and Mongey (a great example of how macroeconomic theory can help us think through questions like this). They explain that when deciding whether to work or to collect government checks, workers donxe2x80x99t just care about how much money theyxe2x80x99ll get next month; they care about how much money theyxe2x80x99ll be able to get six months or a year or two years from now. Jobs are hard to find, and coming back to work after a period of unemployment can also mean your wages take a big hit. So itxe2x80x99s generally better to hang onto a job if you can, even if that means a little less money for a few months. Combine that with the stimulative effects of Pandemic UI xe2x80x94 that consumption increase I mentioned earlier xe2x80x94 and itxe2x80x99s entirely possible that Pandemic UI had no negative effect on employment at all. Or even a slight positive effect!Of course, that leaves open the possibility that if Pandemic UI had been extended through the end of 2020, a few workers would have decided that it was permanent, and would have started dropping out of the workforce in late summer or fall. That possibility canxe2x80x99t be ruled out. And an actually permanent version of Pandemic UI almost certainly would reduce employment by a substantial amount.But thatxe2x80x99s not what happened. What happened is that the government gave unemployed people a bunch of money in a time of need, and they used that money to avoid poverty, and they kept trying to get jobs, and the people who still had jobs didnxe2x80x99t quit those jobs in order to sit on the couch and collect checks. The program was a success, and the arguments of the naysayers donxe2x80x99t really have a leg to stand on.____________________________________________________________________________(By the way, remember that if you like this blog, you can subscribe here!

That is no surprise.  Try reading http://redistributionrecession.com or many other articles I've written on the subject saying \"equity-efficiency tradeoff\". So unless you assume no tradeoff, pointing to more equity means smaller aggregate economic pie.You are welcome to assume no tradeoff, but then you have assumed the answer rather than supporting it with the poverty findings.No posts","title":"No, Pandemic UI didn't kill jobs - Noahpinion","url":"https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/no-pandemic-ui-didnt-kill-jobs"}

So here it is. Itxe2x80x99s important to note that I DONxe2x80x99T BELIEVE THIS THEORY IS TRUE. But I donxe2x80x99t fully disbelieve it either. Itxe2x80x99s one of those scary big ideas that has a few pieces of anecdotal evidence to support it, but which would represent a huge change in the way the world works, so is probably unlikely. The purpose of this post is not to say xe2x80x9cthis is the way the world will work,xe2x80x9d but rather xe2x80x9chere is one scary possibility for how the world might work, and Ixe2x80x99m a little more worried about this than I used to be.xe2x80x9d Itxe2x80x99s a warning, not a prediction.So, that saidxe2x80xa6In his 1989 book The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, historian Paul Kennedy tries to explain how geopolitical power switches from one country, regime, or empire to another. The basic upshot is that powers that are better at marshalling economic resources tend to displace powers that arenxe2x80x99t as good at it. But what conveys economic strength changes over time. In the 1600s and 1700s, it was all about public finance xe2x80x94 countries like France and Britain that had better administrative bureaucracies and were better at collecting taxes could pay for armies, while countries like Spain kept going bankrupt. In the 1800s, as the Industrial Revolution got underway, economic strength became more about manufacturing prowess. The U.S., Germany, and Japan ended up being manufacturing powerhouses, while the USSR did OK for a while and then sort of dropped off. Later, the U.S. harnessed the power of high-value service and tech industries to outspend the USSR in the Cold War.So you can look at this as being a story about economics, or you can look at it as being a story about technology. In each of these periods, the dominant powers were the ones who managed to use their national institutions to take advantage of a specific technology that was very useful for the type of great-power competition that prevailed at the time. In the 1600s and 1700s, great-power competition was about buying armies (either mercenaries or professional armies) to go take bits of land from your rivals. Public finance, which was really enabled by information technology (the printing press), helped with that. In the 1800s and early 1900s, great-power competition was about raising a big army to invade and conquer your rivals. Manufacturing helped with that. Etc.So in the 21st century, what will great-power war look like? It might look like the Cold War, with rivals building up huge arsenals of superweapons and staring each other down. It might be about limited conflicts between navies, or something like that. But it might be about fomenting instability in your rivals and maintaining stability at home. Many people believe that the so-called xe2x80x9ccolor revolutionsxe2x80x9d in East Europe and Central Asia played an important role in destabilizing the USSR and, later, checking Russian power. Some claim that those revolutions were fomented by the CIA. I think thatxe2x80x99s unlikely, but whether itxe2x80x99s true seems pretty immaterial. The much more important fact, it seems to me, is that this sort of instability is a feature of the modern, interconnected world xe2x80x94 and much more so in the age of the internet. The color revolutions were only a harbinger of what was to come.The 2019 protests that rocked every region of the planet had no real unifying theme. They included separatist movements, protests against economic inequality, protests against authoritarianism, and even climate protests. The huge, unprecedented protests in the U.S. a year later were about police brutality. Ixe2x80x99m not sure anyone ever figured out what the protests in France were about. If therexe2x80x99s one xe2x80x9csilver bulletxe2x80x9d explanation for why protests are erupting all over the world, itxe2x80x99s technology. Social media dramatically lowers the cost of both organizing a protest and spreading a protest-related ideology. Martin Gurrixe2x80x99s The Revolt of the Public and Zeynep Tufekcixe2x80x99s Twitter and Tear Gas are essential reading on this topic. Big protests create instability and can paralyze governments xe2x80x94 or even, as we saw with the color revolutions, overthrow them. Great-power conflict in the 21st century might simply be about outlasting your opponents xe2x80x94 holding out longer against the naturally bubbling forces of internal dissent. So then the question becomes: If social media driven protests are a permanent feature of the modern age, what sort of institutions and technology allow governments to resist the resulting instability?And Ixe2x80x99m not sure wexe2x80x99ll like the answer.In the 1980s and 1990s, many Americans believed that a combination of trade, technology, and cultural exchange would make repressive societies choose freedom. In 1984, Apple Computer gave voice to this idea with its famous ad, in which a woman with a hammer smashes a screen dispensing Big Brother-style authoritarian propaganda.The color revolutions, the fall of the USSR, and the spread of democracy seemed to validate this idea for a while. But China notably resisted the trend. In the 90s, the idea that trade would make the Chinese masses demand democracy and human rights from their government was a popular argument for letting China into global trade networks. Others confidently predicted that the internet would bring freedom to China. Things didnxe2x80x99t work out that way. China crushed the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, a wave of rural unrest in the 2000s, and the Hong Kong protests in 2019-20. Its xe2x80x9cGreat Firewallxe2x80x9d effectively keeps out foreign information, while its army of censors and online propagandists keep a lid on domestic dissent. Chinese authoritarianism enriched itself through trade and defeated the internet in a direct contest of wills.And Apple? It took the Quartz app out of its Chinese App Store in 2019, after the Chinese government complained about Quartzxe2x80x99 coverage of the Hong Kong protests. So much for that cute little ad.This, then, is the Scary Theory of the 21st Century: Perhaps the internet is not a tool of freedom so much as evolutionary pressure that selects for authoritarianism. Perhaps social media has changed the nature of great-power competition into an endurance match in which control of the internet is key. Perhaps every country that doesnxe2x80x99t implement its own version of the Great Firewall and the 50 Cent Party will eventually fall victim to waves of Twitter-generated unrest. OK but it gets scarier. Social media control is about using traditional methods xe2x80x94 government propagandists and legal control of the information ecosystem xe2x80x94 to limit the effects of a new technology. But therexe2x80x99s another new technology that might allow authoritarian regimes to exert a level of control that 20th century totalitarians could only dream of. That technology is machine learning xe2x80x94 or as we commonly call it, A.I.China is a global leader in A.I. technology, behind only the U.S. But unlike the U.S., China has enthusiastically bent this new technology toward creating a deep and robust system of government surveillance and social control. Here, via the Atlantic, is a lengthy description of how the Chinese government has deployed an early version of this system (combined with substantial elements of old-school human surveillance and policing) to repress the Uighurs in Xinjiang. Some choice excerpts:AI-powered sensors lurk everywhere, including in Uighursxe2x80x99 purses and pants pockets. According to the anthropologist Darren Byler, some Uighurs buried their mobile phones containing Islamic materials, or even froze their data cards into dumplings for safekeeping, when Xixe2x80x99s campaign of cultural erasure reached full tilt. But police have since forced them to install nanny apps on their new phones. The apps use algorithms to hunt for xe2x80x9cideological virusesxe2x80x9d day and night. They can scan chat logs for Quran verses, and look for Arabic script in memes and other image filesxe2x80xa6Purchasing prayer rugs online, storing digital copies of Muslim books, and downloading sermons from a favorite imam are all risky activities. If a Uighur were to use WeChatxe2x80x99s payment system to make a donation to a mosque, authorities might take notexe2x80xa6Uighurs can travel only a few blocks before encountering a checkpoint outfitted with one of Xinjiangxe2x80x99s hundreds of thousands of surveillance cameras. Footage from the cameras is processed by algorithms that match faces with snapshots taken by police at xe2x80x9chealth checks.xe2x80x9d At these checks, police extract all the data they can from Uighursxe2x80x99 bodies. They measure height and take a blood sample. They record voices and swab DNA. Some Uighurs have even been forced to participate in experiments that mine genetic data, to see how DNA produces distinctly Uighurlike chins and ears. Police will likely use the pandemic as a pretext to take still more data from Uighur bodiesxe2x80xa6When Uighurs reach the edge of their neighborhood, an automated system takes note. The same system tracks them as they move through smaller checkpoints, at banks, parks, and schools. When they pump gas, the system can determine whether they are the carxe2x80x99s owner. At the cityxe2x80x99s perimeter, theyxe2x80x99re forced to exit their cars, so their face and ID card can be scanned again.Therexe2x80x99s much more, so do read the whole thing. This is a level of totalitarian control that would have made Stalin or Hitler green with envy. No civilization in history has had the ability to centrally monitor the faces and the personal communications of an entire populace. Nor have text and voice communications ever before been observable over centralized electronic networks. The internet makes universal surveillance possible, and A.I. makes it easier.China still relies on a large army of humans to do much of this surveillance work, but as computer vision and natural language processing become more advanced, A.I. is gradually augmenting or even replacing the human snoops. The Atlantic article describes a system called City Brain that China is trying to build, which is intended to keep track of everything that happens in Chinese cities, from peoplexe2x80x99s movements and meetings to their store purchases to the trash they throw away. Integrate a system like that that with digital surveillance and natural language processing, and you could theoretically know practically everything about each and every citizen except the private thoughts inside their heads (and donxe2x80x99t think someone isnxe2x80x99t working on that!). Of course, as the Atlantic article takes pains to note, these technologies are not yet mature. Chinaxe2x80x99s A.I. surveillance systems are advancing quickly, but it will be quite some time xe2x80x94 no one really knows how long xe2x80x94 before Big Brother can be completely automated. So to all those angry A.I. researchers about to jump into the comments and say xe2x80x9cTHATxe2x80x99S SCIENCE FICTIONxe2x80x9d: Yes. Itxe2x80x99s still science fiction. But every year it becomes a little bit less science-fictiony.The Scary Theory, therefore, holds that in addition to using their overbearing institutions to suppress social media, new authoritarian Great Powers like China will also be able to use emerging A.I. technology to achieve a level of totalitarian social control never before imagined except in dystopian novels. Whether technological totalitarianism makes for an effective society, of course, is an open question. Being constantly surveilled and controlled might eventually make people all the more determined to rebel, even at the cost of their lives. Or it might make society listless, lackadaisical, unmotivated, and unproductive. Or it might ultimately just be a big headache and a big cost for not much benefit.We donxe2x80x99t know yet. Which is why the Scary Theory of techno-authoritarian great power dominance is still just a speculative, scary idea. But itxe2x80x99s an idea that I have trouble getting out of my head. The more China goes from strength to strength while increasing its social control, and the more its democratic rivals seem to lapse into division and chaos, the more I worry. There is no law of the Universe saying that freedom and democracy and respect for individual rights always triumph in the end xe2x80x94 oHenry r if there is such a law, we donxe2x80x99t know it yet. For all we know, the arc of history could bend in any direction at all. Anyway, just throwing that out there. Sleep tight, sweet dreams!____________________________________________________________________________* The friend is Steve Glinert, and he asked to be credited.

But donxe2x80x99t worry! This wonxe2x80x99t happen!Jevonsxe2x80x99 Paradox is about efficiency. When you get more efficient at providing something, sometimes you actually end up using more of it instead of less. This is why policies that increase energy efficiency can occasionally lead to higher energy usage. But green energy tech isnxe2x80x99t about efficiency; itxe2x80x99s about substitution. Jevonsxe2x80x99 Paradox doesnxe2x80x99t apply. To see why, letxe2x80x99s explain why Jevonsxe2x80x99 Paradox works. Suppose wexe2x80x99re talking about the market for oil. Letxe2x80x99s represent this with a simple supply-and-demand graph:OK, so now suppose we become more efficient at using oil. Wikipedia depicts this situation in the following way:But cost doesnxe2x80x99t just move on its own. Whatxe2x80x99s really happening here is that the supply curve xe2x80x94 which isnxe2x80x99t shown in the Wikipedia graph xe2x80x94 has shifted to the right. If we become more efficient at turning oil into energy, it means that sellers of energy are able to provide more energy at any given price. So whatxe2x80x99s really happening is this:If the increase in energy use is large enough (which happens if the blue demand curve is flat enough, i.e. if demand is elastic enough), then it actually causes an increase in oil usage, despite the fact that we got more efficient at turning oil into energy!Thatxe2x80x99s Jevonsxe2x80x99 Paradox.OK, but now letxe2x80x99s think about what happens when car batteries get cheaper. This is completely different from the example above. Car batteries are a substitute for oil. When substitutes for a good get cheaper, that good falls in price. Just think about pens and pencils. If pens get cheaper, people become less willing to pay high prices for pencils, since they can go buy cheap pens now instead. So demand for pencils falls.Car batteries and oil are just like that. When car batteries get cheap, demand for oil falls. The situation looks like this:Cheaper batteries mean that oil gets cheaper, and that we also use less oil.At this point, you might ask: xe2x80x9cOK Noah, but energy gets cheaper as a result of cheap batteries. Doesnxe2x80x99t that mean that people will use more energy, just like in the first example earlier? And doesnxe2x80x99t that mean that the people who still get their energy from oil will use more oil?xe2x80x9dNope!The reason is that in the second example, the cost of getting energy from batteries goes down, but the cost of getting energy from oil stays exactly the same. A barrel of oil still costs the same to pump out of the ground and refine and deliver to the gas station. An internal combustion car still gets the same amount of energy out of a gallon of gasoline. So what happens when batteries get cheaper is that the quantity of oil consumed just goes down. Marginal, expensive-to-extract oil like the Canadian tar sands will no longer be worth it to extract; for the same cost, you would be better off just building some batteries instead. So people will just leave the expensive oil in the ground.Remember: Jevonsxe2x80x99 Paradox is about efficiency, not about substitution. Green energy is about substitution. Itxe2x80x99s like when cars came along and replaced horses. So while Jevonsxe2x80x99 Paradox can be a problem for energy efficiency policies, itxe2x80x99s not a problem for green energy.

Hey Noah. Just trying to wrap my head around this. You are talking specifically about the consumption of oil right? If batteries get cheaper, consumption of oil goes down. Period. In the context of Jevon's paradox, that makes total sense. But how do you think it'll impact the consumption of energy? If batteries are cheaper and we look at travel demand, the demand curve shifts outward due to income effects right? Of course, I assume energy consumption is only going to go up with time due to population growth and upward mobility, so it's still superior to use batteries due to fewer negative externalities.

From Deep Blue (chess) in the 1990s, to AlphaGo (Go) more recently, computers seem to be performing well against their human counterparts. Even games like poker arenxe2x80x99t completely safe from the machine takeover.In this series, I hope to go over some of the basic machine learning methods used to play games. Future posts will deal with reinforcement learning but for this first part, letxe2x80x99s just focus on exhaustive search and table lookup. Although impractical for larger games, a kind of table lookup remains at the core of many reinforcement learning algorithms.Letxe2x80x99s start with tic-tac-toe and try to build a bot that can play at least as well as a chicken.Everything below is also available here under Part 1 xe2x80x94 Tic Tac Toe Minimax.ipynbTic-tac-toe has 9 possible spaces with 3 possible values for each space (X, O or blank). Ignoring illegal configurations (e.g. all Xs), there are 9 factorial (362,880) possible games and 3 ^ 9 (19,683) possible boards . The actual numbers are less (by a factor of 100 or so) since some boards are impossible and you can treat symmetrically similar boards as the same, but wexe2x80x99ll ignore that since even the upper bound of the state space is manageable on a CPU.Since the state space of tic-tac-toe is so small we can easily just exhaust the space and come up with a lookup table based on the board and who youxe2x80x99re playing as. Actually, xkcd beat me to it but letxe2x80x99s do one anyway.Letxe2x80x99s start with a game board. Itxe2x80x99s pretty boring as far as tic-tac-toe boards go. It letxe2x80x99s the user interface with the board through a move function and spaces are represented with integers 1 to 9.Below is an implementation that letxe2x80x99s you play against a bot and see how it performs. Itxe2x80x99s pretty straight forward, and just requires a game object that can print, accept moves and has legal players. The bot has to have a function called called play that accepts a game object and returns a move.Now on to the strategy. Since tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game (whatxe2x80x99s good for me is bad for my opponent, and vice versa), we can use mini-max decision rule to exhaust all possible moves. The way mini-max works is it basically asks: whatxe2x80x99s my best move (MAX) if my opponent follows my move with the worst possible move for me (MINI) and I follow that with my best move (MAX) and so on. Below is an example of mini-max on a tic-tac-toe board.The states that have a border are the states that are selected for that level to percolate back up to the higher level. So reading from the bottom up, there is only one choice in that branch, so this is the state that moves up. On the level above that (the MIN level), we have two options, and since wexe2x80x99re looking at min values, we take the worse of the two. The layer above that is the MAX level, and we have three option, two of which return -1 and the other returns +1, so we choose the +1 since its the max value.There are certainly more concise and elegant ways to write a generic mini-max rule, but the below is a somewhat verbose implementation of mini-max designed for our board:One brief somewhat wonky note on this board is that itxe2x80x99s for games that have the Markov property. Meaning that everything you need to know is in a state representation. There is no path dependence. This doesnxe2x80x99t hold true for many games. For instance, in many games an object has movement whose direction is not clear from a single frame. So if the object is moving towards your or away from you, your actions may be different but you canxe2x80x99t tell which of the direction from just one frame. Wexe2x80x99ll create designs to deal with that later.So how does it do? Well, tic-tac-toe is an unwinnable game so our bot should at least not lose (human is X).Good! Letxe2x80x99s see if the bot can win (human is O).Something interesting happens here. It appears as though our bot is in no rush to win. So if youxe2x80x99re in a state where a winning move is available, but the next move can win as well, our bot may choose to wait as long as there is no possible scenario which it can lose. This is exactly what happened after my first move.The reason it is in no rush is because the way we wrote the decision rule, there is no negative time value. To remedy this, we could build in a penalty for each time step. This doesnxe2x80x99t have to be a large value, but just big enough to nudge the rule to prefer actions that end the game. If set too high, you could imagine the decision rule could purposely make a move to lose the game in order to prevent taking a penalty from just playing out the future moves.In the example below, there is a penalty of 0.1 at each time step. Without a time penalty, the bot would be indifferent of the action it would take even though the right most action would be the longest. With a time penalty, the bot is nudged to one of the two action that terminate the game.Here is the time-value bot. Everything is the same, except the time_penalty input and a few lines which have comments (lines 29:31)Letxe2x80x99s see how it does:Thatxe2x80x99s better. It takes goes for the quick kill. But something else is happening thatxe2x80x99s odd. The bots first move is the top left corner. Every savvy tic-tac-toe knows thatxe2x80x99s an amateur move. Sure, you can still guarantee you wonxe2x80x99t lose, but there are fewer ways to win. Why doesnxe2x80x99t the bot play the more traditional middle square?The problem is that the bot assumes perfect play by the opponent. What we may want to do is tell the bot to consider sub-optimal play, even if itxe2x80x99s just a little to nudge our decisions to a path that may be more likely to win if the opponent slips up. There are a number of ways to do this, but a simple way is to weight all sub-optimal moves by some percentage (e.g. sub-optimal weight of 0.1 means the value of a move is equal to 90% on the optimal award and 10% on the average sub-optimal award).Herexe2x80x99s the implementation below. Again, everything is the same except accepting a sub-optimal weight and the commented portions (lines 38:41).So how does it do?Pretty goodxe2x80xa6The nice thing about these bots is that theyxe2x80x99re fairly general, so we can create our own games an apply them. I would caution though that since it relies on exhaustion, the state space would have to very small. I created a game class for connect-4 the follows the same basic format of the tic-tac-toe board, which will allow us to use our bots and play function.You canxe2x80x99t really use mini-max on connect-4 since the state space is too large. The standard board is 6 (height) x 7 (width) which comes out to 4,531,985,219,092 possible positions. So unless you need a good excuse to restart your computer, I wouldnxe2x80x99t suggest trying to run it with one of the bots we wrote. But we can place a limit as to the number of steps ahead our bot can consider. So eventually it just gives up. Below Ixe2x80x99ve edited our bot class to take a limit argument and cut off the search after the number of steps has exceeded that limit. It evaluates the state at that point and just returns the value (lines 23:25).The next step would be to get a final evaluation of the board in the terminal (last) step. But Ixe2x80x99ll leave that there.Many reinforcement learning algorithms boil down to this basic premise. Get a board representation and do a kind of lookup. Thatxe2x80x99s it. The board may be a tic-tac-toe board, a 17x17 Go board or a (210, 160, 3) array representing the pixel values of an Atari game. We take some representation of this board, often times running manipulations on the representation, and try to predict the estimated future reward based on some set of actions. And then we choose the action with the highest reward, lowest risk, or some other consideration. Much of the work is just getting fancy with what we consider the state, either by running it through a neural network or considering multiple frames. The other part is pruning, meaning that we donxe2x80x99t let our bots go down very unlikely sub-optimal paths. So we often have a bot play against another bot (or the game logic itself), see what happened based on the state, and nudge the lookup to try to better predict what actually happened based on the state.Future posts will do just that and solve more complicated games by manipulating the pixel values. For those interested, a free textbook on reinforcement learning is available online which is really thorough and a great resource as long as youxe2x80x99re okay with more mathematical notations and pseudo-code (and no I donxe2x80x99t mean python). There is also a great Reinforcement Learning course on YouTube by DeepMind (Googlexe2x80x99s team that created AlphaGo), which I recommend as well as other resources if you just search.

For years, he watched as right leaning conservative groups built huge Facebook followings, which allowed them to promote their highly partisan views to millions of Canadian citizens.So Geoff and his colleagues decided to do something about it. They initially launched their own left-leaning Facebook page, growing it to hundreds of thousands of followers. But they then wanted to pivot to something even more ambitious: a standalone website that published original opinion content from leading progressive voices.To do this, they launched a crowdfunding campaign, and over the last year theyxe2x80x99ve rolled out a membership program that helps generate recurring revenue. I interviewed Geoff about why the political Right does so well on Facebook, how he designed the membership program, and what impact his site has had on Canadian politics.To listen to the interview, subscribe to The Business of Content on your favorite podcast player. If you scroll down youxe2x80x99ll also find some transcribed highlights from the interview.iTunes/ Stitcher/  Overcast/ Spotify/ Google/ YouTube/ AudibleThis transcript has been edited for clarity.Growing a successful Facebook pageGeoff spent a good portion of his career working in Canadian politics, mostly on the digital marketing side of things. He began to notice that conservative groups were highly effective at pushing their content on Facebook, which often allowed them to bypass the traditional media to communicate their partisan messaging. xe2x80x9cThe Right is creating a lot of really engaging content, and we had seen what had happened in the U.S. and were pretty concerned that therexe2x80x99d be a similar trajectory up here in Canada.xe2x80x9dSo Geoff and some colleagues created North99, a donor-funded organization that mostly operated on social media. xe2x80x9cWe decided there's an opportunity here to create something on the progressive side that really tries to engage people beyond just serving them traditional news articles.xe2x80x9d The group began circulating custom-made graphics and memes, eventually growing its Facebook page to over 140,000 followers. While growing the page, Geoff realized that the Rightxe2x80x99s success on Facebook was due to its ability to deliver information in bite-sized chunks that could be consumed and shared quickly. xe2x80x9cThere's lots of information being thrown at you. Our thinking around it was: how do you take a piece of information and frame content around it in a way that will make a progressive audience really care? And because we had the ability to see shares, reach, likes, engagement, all the rest of that type of stuff over time, we figured out what our audience wanted and the issues they supported.xe2x80x9dExpanding beyond FacebookEventually, Facebook rolled out algorithm changes that reduced the reach of political pages within the Newsfeed. Geoff also wanted the chance to go deeper on issues that couldnxe2x80x99t be summed up in a single graphic or meme. xe2x80x9cWe surveyed our audience and asked what they might be interested in, and there was real interest in discussing ideas in a more in-depth way. So we set up a separate publication.xe2x80x9d The site was called Passage, and its founders also simultaneously launched a crowdfunding campaign with the goal of funding the website for its first year. The campaign raised about $33,000. Passage primarily publishes opinion and analysis pieces. xe2x80x9cWe have an editor who runs the content side of things while we run the marketing side to engage audiences and build more of a sustainable publication.xe2x80x9d It typically publishes about three opinion pieces a week. xe2x80x9cWe also have a daily newsletter that we run. We created three email courses with hopefully a fourth one coming soon. We have a podcast that we run that is basically just our articles converted into an audio format.xe2x80x9d Building a membership baseWhile the crowdfunding campaign provided the initial funding for Passage, itxe2x80x99s now attempting to build a more sustainable model around paid memberships. Because the founders donxe2x80x99t want to lock anything behind a paywall, they have to constantly convince readers that the sitexe2x80x99s mission is worth supporting. One of their biggest drivers of paid conversions is their online courses, since they require a deeper level of engagement. xe2x80x9cGenerally, after someone signs up for a course, they're presented with a message asking them to support our publication. What we see is the course basically pays for itself immediately after we launch it, because people are just so supportive of it, they're willing to become members. These courses last basically forever, and that's just a piece of content that you can use to engage with people, not just when they arrive on the site, but longer term. It just extends the value of the content in a really interesting way that an article itself might not.xe2x80x9dThe courses donxe2x80x99t teach any particular skills, but rather dive deep on certain progressive issues. xe2x80x9cWe have one that talks about deepening democracy in Canada. We have another one called xe2x80x98How the Car Conquered the Worldxe2x80x99 and it looks at the rise of the car in cities and how lobbying helped shape that. And another one we have is called xe2x80x98Socialism Success Stories,xe2x80x99 and it looks at where we've seen socialism and democratic socialism be successful and breaks down some of those myths around socialism. What we do usually is ask our members what kind of course they want to see, and they get to vote on the topic that we'll do. And thatxe2x80x99s a perk of being a member of Passage.xe2x80x9dGeoff doesnxe2x80x99t have any grand ambitions for turning the site into a thriving business; he just wants it to be able to sustain itself and maybe fund even more progressive writing. To do that, Passage needs to continue communicating its mission and convince its quickly growing audience that its content is worth paying for, even if it remains completely free to consume. But regardless of how big Passage gets, Geoff has been vindicated; with very little funding and virtually no institutional support, he and his colleagues proved they could counter the political Rightxe2x80x99s messaging online.Do you like this newsletter?Then you should subscribe here:Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist living in Washington, DC.

I'm Simon Owens and this is my media newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:Ok, letxe2x80x99s jump into the newsletterxe2x80xa6This is an interview with Stephen Perlstein, the VP of Podcasts at Studio71, which helps famous YouTubers launch their own podcasts. You may have noticed sometime in the last year that it seems like every famous YouTuber is launching a podcast, and there are a few reasons for this.The first has to do with the fact that podcasts are still mostly distributed in a decentralized, straightforward fashion xe2x80x94 one in which their episodes are delivered to subscribers in reverse chronological order. YouTubers live and die by the YouTube homepage algorithm, and itxe2x80x99s not necessarily a given that their videos will actually reach most of their subscribers. Perlstein discussed this reasoning in the interview:If youxe2x80x99ve spent any time in the influencer space, you know they spend a lot of time talking about the algorithm. I think they like to be free of it and forge deeper connections with their audiences in a way thatxe2x80x99s genuine and authentic, while making money at the same time xe2x80xa6xe2x80xa6 Some of them definitely recognize that the YouTube algorithm can be a finicky beast and that, relatively speaking, a podcast subscriber or follower has a more direct connection that doesnxe2x80x99t waver in the same way.I canxe2x80x99t speak for every creator, but Ixe2x80x99ve definitely heard rumblings along those ideas. But itxe2x80x99s also just the reality that a lot of top creators have to do certain things on YouTube xe2x80x94 whatever that means xe2x80x94 to stay relevant. Thatxe2x80x99s not always the case with podcasts. Obviously, it helps to have a big guest or a surprising, fun episode, but you donxe2x80x99t have to worry about losing 50% of your audience video over video in the same way.YouTubers also turn to podcasts to forge more intimate connections with their audiences. Why does an audio medium like podcasting induce more intimacy than an audio/visual one like YouTube? Because therexe2x80x99s something incredibly intentional about firing up a podcast app, choosing a particular episode, and then beaming it directly into your AirPods. A lot of YouTube views come from flyby viewers who land on a specific video and then never watch anything else from that same channel. Podcast listeners are much more likely to subscribe and return to your content over and over again.And then the final reason so many YouTubers are launching podcasts is that video versions of podcasts do surprisingly well on YouTube. The creator simply builds a recording studio and films the hosts/guests from multiple angles, and that simple setup can be highly engaging to watch.Take Hila and Ethan Klein as examples. Their main H3H3 Productions channel has 6.4 million subscribers and 1.5 billion views. They also have two channels dedicated to their H3 Podcast. The first is used to upload entire episodes, each upwards of two hours long. That channel has 2.9 million subscribers and over 500 million views. And then a second channel is dedicated to short clips of the podcast; it has 1.6 million subscribers and 730 million views. And thatxe2x80x99s just the audience on YouTube xe2x80x94 not counting the people listening to the podcast in their apps.This kind of dynamic grants you so much more mileage out of your content, allowing you to basically build out a following on two separate mediums without much extra effort. Thatxe2x80x99s probably the reason why Hila and Ethan have seemingly abandoned their main YouTube channel and are focusing almost entirely on their podcast right now.Daily news podcasts like The New York Timesxe2x80x99s The Daily have drawn in huge audiences and generate significant revenue, but can that success be replicated at the local level? Daily Detroit is proving that local news podcasts can grow into sustainable businesses. I recently interviewed its founder Jer Staes about how he bootstrapped the show into becoming one of the most influential media outlets in the Detroit area.To access this case study and others like it, you need to become a paying subscriber to this newsletter.

The section will focus on evergreen basics and will make use of the rigor that Wirecutter uses in its other reviews, a testing process that can take between four to 10 weeks, said deputy editor Jason Chen.Wirecutter is moving into fashion, sort of, and also trying to cover fast-moving product trends. In other words, it's becoming more \"newsy.\"This is a good deep dive into how some local publishers have seen success with operating virtual events.  I set it to private and then only promote it within this newsletter. That way I can ensure that the only people I let in are just as obsessed with the media industry as I am. There are now over 500 members and we chat about industry news on a daily basis. Join here: [Facebook]From the article:TikTok news personalities Josh Helfgott and Lisa Remillard realized in 2020 that all it took to build their brand and spread the news was a camera, decent lighting and background knowledge in storytelling. Helfgott has more than 3.1 million followers, and Remillard has a million.In many ways, being able to script, record and edit a video all in one platform is like having a broadcast studio at your fingertips, which is what drew Remillard, known as xe2x80x9cThe News Girl,xe2x80x9d to the app. She had previously worked for a variety of ABC News affiliates and now runs her own video production company, Beond TV, in Los Angeles.It's funny how much these TikTok videos resemble traditional TV news broadcasts, they're just chopped up and distributed as individual news segments instead of tied together into one 30-minute broadcast. From the article:Podcasts ... generate NPRxe2x80x99s largest chunk of corporate sponsorship money, one of the public radio giantxe2x80x99s most important sources of revenue. The amount that NPRxe2x80x99s podcasts have made through this avenue has tripled in the past five years.  The public radio ecosystem is just going to look so different a decade from now. Traditionally, local public radio stations provided a way to beam national content from  places like NPR into the car radios of local listeners, but now itxe2x80x99s just so much easier for NPR to reach those listeners directly via podcasts.So what does that mean for the stations? Some will probably die off, but the survivors will double down on providing great local programming that canxe2x80x99t be replicated anywhere else. If youxe2x80x99re New York Public Radio, thatxe2x80x99ll be relatively easy. But if youxe2x80x99re a station in rural Nebraska? You probably have a much bigger lift ahead of you.I've always thought Mr. Beast was one of the world's most overrated YouTubers. His videos are extremely gimmicky and boring. I've never been able to sit through one in its entirety. I'm definitely confused as to how this acquisition fits into Twitter's mission. Why is an ads-funded platform acquiring a company that removes ads from media websites? Can't really see how this integrates with any of Twitter's current core offerings.Not only that, but this acquisition apparently resulted in the closing of Nuzzel, which was a product that people actually liked and enhanced the Twitter experience.  Luxury real estate is becoming a huge niche on YouTube.This is really fascinating. The Globe & Mail relies on an AI program called Sophie that constantly scans content and determines whether an article should be placed behind or in front of the paywall. It also optimizes article placement on the homepage to drive more engagement.  From the article:A company spokesperson says: xe2x80x9cSophi has helped the Globe move from a 70% advertising revenue and 30% reader revenue split, to a 30% advertising and 70% subscription revenue split, and wexe2x80x99re not losing market share on the advertising side.xe2x80x9dThe Globe says Sophi has brought in a 17% increase in click-through rate from the homepage and a 10% increase in subscriber acquisition.It says that Sophixe2x80x99s work at the Globe has led to millions of dollars in incremental revenues, a more than 100% increase in website registrations and the 51% increase in subscription conversion.This is a great example of how creators can diversify their income streams. She runs a popular YouTube channel AND sells her own games -- which she plays on her YouTube channel. It creates a fantastic feedback loop.Then you should subscribe here:Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist living in Washington, DC. Follow him on Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.

About a year ago, there was an update to the system to help measure engagement within reportersxe2x80x99 goals. For example, if a slideshow has 50 images, each image viewed equals one page view. In text-based stories, every 50 words scrolled equals another page view, according to a former reporter. This is because at about that interval of text and images, there is a new ad that generates on the page, equating page views to ad views. All of the data is automatically collected and generated into a shared audience data platform called Chartbeat.This is a fascinating deep dive into how Business Insider quantifies the success of each of its journalists.A lot of people in my Twitter timeline used this Digiday article to bash such metrics-based systems, but itxe2x80x99s hard for me to get angry that a news organization is codifying a system that virtually every newsroom already has in place. If you work at a digital outlet long enough, you know that a handful of staffers are typically responsible for the bulk of traffic each month and that management places a lot of value on that traffic. Business Insider is effectively trying to create a more level playing field by offering up several different metrics for measuring an employeexe2x80x99s worth other than just raw traffic.Letxe2x80x99s say youxe2x80x99re a writer that specializes in longer, in-depth pieces that donxe2x80x99t go super viral, but those articles generate deeper engagement for the readers that land on them. Under BIxe2x80x99s rubric, that writer can be judged on a level playing field compared to a colleague who pumps out 500-word viral fluff.  Will these metrics ever be 100% fair? Definitely not. Will publishers always need some level of subjective analysis for judging a writerxe2x80x99s worth? Sure. But Ixe2x80x99ve worked for an outlet that used opaque, pageview-driven metrics for evaluating journalistsxe2x80x99 value, and I would have swapped those for Business Insiderxe2x80x99s more sophisticated system any day of the week xe2x80x94 not only because BIxe2x80x99s system is fairer, but also because it results in better journalism.6AM City reaches 400,000 individual email subscribers and generates 15 million monthly impressions. It wants to be operating in all 50 states within the next few years.A few weeks ago I put out a call to my social media followers for questions, and I finally got around to answering them. Check out the video I made and leave me new questions in the comments section.From the article:In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet said YouTube brought in revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter xe2x80x94 up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. Thatxe2x80x99s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. Itxe2x80x99s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth in Q1, and expects growth to slow to 19% next quarter.If its current growth trajectory continues, YouTube will book between $29 billion and $30 billion in revenue this year. Netflix is expected to report $29.7 billion in revenue for 2021, according to an average of estimates from analysts polled by Refinitiv.55% of YouTube's revenue goes to content creators. That's $16 billion per year. Just think of how many of tomorrow's top filmmakers are getting their start on this massive platform.  This is why I don't spend much time fretting about the size of Disney.Is Disney a huge conglomerate that's taking a bigger and bigger chunk of traditional box office?  Sure, but it's also never been a better time to be an independent filmmaker.  From the article:At the beginning of 2020, Flipboard began talking with successful newsletter publishers that successfully sold sponsorships against their newsletters rather than run-of-the-mill display ads. By the fourth quarter of 2020, Flipboard had begun removing banner ads from its emails, starting with its flagship xe2x80x9c10 for Todayxe2x80x9d email, which curates the top 10 most interesting stories of the day.By the end of the first quarter of 2021, the company had moved nearly all of its emails to a so-called xe2x80x9cnative,xe2x80x9d or sponsorship, format, in which an advertiser pays to sponsor an email for a single day and have a piece of branded content appear in the body of the newsletter. Flipboard is on track to do away with banner ads completely by the end of the second quarter for its seven regular newsletters.Was anyone else surprised to learn that Flipboard has a robust newsletter operation? I guess it makes sense as a way to keep users engaged even when they're not constantly opening the app.From the article:Snapchat has so far spent $90 million on Spotlight ... We can guess that most of the money likely went toward the $1 million-per-day payout Spotlight divvies up amongst creators of its top-trending videos.This is a lovely history of the New York Times op-ed.Five or six years ago, even a YouTuber with 1 million subscribers could struggle to pull in a decent income. Now, a YouTuber with just 350,000 subscribers can make into the high six figures.At first glance, Spotify's podcast subscription platform beats Apple's on almost every front: Fees: Apple plans to take a 30% cut during the first year a listener subscribes and a 15% cut after that. Spotify will take no cut (other than payment fees) for the first few years and then phase in a 5% cut. The only downside to Spotifyxe2x80x99s system is that podcasters will have to drive subscribers to a web URL to complete the transaction in order to avoid iOS and Android app store fees. Within the Apple Podcast app, subscribing is a more seamless experience. Access: This is the most exciting part of the announcement. As youxe2x80x99re probably already aware, the Apple Podcast app is only available on iOS, whereas Spotify is available on both iOS and Android. But Spotify is also allowing for the creation of customized RSS feeds so paying subscribers can listen to your paywalled content on other apps, including Applexe2x80x99s. And then finally, Spotify is rolling out an open podcast ecosystem where customized RSS feeds from platforms like Patreon and Supporting Cast can now be played on Spotifyxe2x80x99s player. Thatxe2x80x99s an incredible level of flexibility that Ixe2x80x99m sure a lot of podcasters will appreciate.Audience ownership: One of the biggest criticisms of Applexe2x80x99s subscription offering is that podcasters wonxe2x80x99t have any direct access to their subscribers. Not only are you unable to leave the platform with your subscribers, but you donxe2x80x99t even get basic information about them, including their email addresses. According to some reporting I saw, Spotify will allow more direct audience access, but we wonxe2x80x99t know the details until it rolls the tool out to all creators.My verdict? Apple is innovating too little and too late. It needs to up its game if it wants to maintain its dominance.This pieces makes a good point: writers who launch paid subscription newsletters underestimate how much time is required to work on paywalled content that won't help you grow your audience.  One of the best ways to speed up podcast audience growth is to convert your episodes into articles. Thatxe2x80x99s what the company Podreacher specializes in. I recently interviewed its founder Jaclyn Schiff about how she decided to dive into this very niche form of content marketing and the role these articles can play in speeding up a podcastxe2x80x99s audience growth.Then you should subscribe here:Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist living in Washington, DC.

I'm Simon Owens and this is my media newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:Depending on the day of the week, Erin McPherson had one of two roles at RALtoday, the Raleigh-based newsletter she co-edited before she was promoted to a different job earlier this year. xe2x80x9cThe way that our co-editing experience works is that every day one of us is focused on the newsletter and the other editor is focused on our social media audience development,xe2x80x9d she told me in a February interview, prior to her promotion. On the day that we spoke, McPherson was in charge of compiling the newsletter. xe2x80x9cIn the morning, I aggregate events and news, identifying what's going to be most relevant to our readers.xe2x80x9d Once she was done choosing the news items, she then set about writing small, conversational blurbs around each one, making sure to include links to the original sources. xe2x80x9cThen I will also write that day's conversation, which can be anywhere from 200 words to a full 1,000-word feature.xe2x80x9d Today, for instance, RALtoday devotes the opening 216 words to the history of the North Carolina governorxe2x80x99s mansion. A few days ago it opened with 328 words recommending 10 things for tourists to do while visiting the city.On the days McPherson was assigned to write the newsletter, her co-editor Carly Delengowski would be on social media and email duty. xe2x80x9cWexe2x80x99ll be on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram going through and responding to posts from other organizations and community members,xe2x80x9d McPherson said. xe2x80x9cOur goal with both emails and comments from readers is to be as close to 100% responsive as possible, making sure that our readers know there are two people on the other side of the product and that we're listening to what they have to say.xe2x80x9dThis isnxe2x80x99t just for brand-building purposes; a tremendous amount of content that ends up in the newsletter is crowdsourced from its readership. Those 10 tips for tourists I referenced above, for example, were all submitted via social media and email.The RALtoday newsletter debuted in late 2019 and now has over 50,000 recipients, almost all of whom organically opted in to receive it. Its success wasnxe2x80x99t a fluke; by the time of its launch, its parent company 6AM City was already operating several other newsletters, all of which utilize the exact same model for curating news. In the five years since its founding, the company has developed a scalable model for crowdsourced local journalism, and it plans to operate in all 50 states within the next few years. I recently interviewed its founders on how they developed this model and what role 6AM City plays in restoring local news.Founding the company6AM Cityxe2x80x99s two founders, Ryan Johnston and Ryan Heafy, come from completely opposite backgrounds.Johnston grew up in a family that owned a newspaper; his father Mark launched it in Greenville, SC two decades ago, and though Ryan didnxe2x80x99t spend much time in the newsroom as a child, he did grow an appreciation for the newspaperxe2x80x99s civic role within the community. The company eventually launched other newspapers, and in 2012 Ryan joined to run a new business publication called Upstate Business Journal. xe2x80x9cOver the course of five years we grew it into the largest circulated business product in the state of South Carolina,xe2x80x9d he told me in a 2020 podcast interview.Heafy, on the other hand, graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and moved to Greenville in 2012 to run an aerospace manufacturing company. In the mid-2010s, Heafy and Johnston started running into each other at a local coffee shop and eventually struck up conversations about their mutual interests. At the time, Johnston was a longtime admirer of daily newsletters like Morning Brew and theSkimm, and he began to wonder if their model could be replicated at the local level. He really liked the idea of having a direct connection to an audience via the inbox, and he thought that a newsletter could become a daily habit in a way that a digital news website couldnxe2x80x99t. When Johnston met Heafy, he felt that hexe2x80x99d found someone with the kind of operational and engineering background needed to scale such an operation. xe2x80x9cAfter a conversation or two and a few beers, I convinced him to come in and help us put together the framework for what this product would look like,xe2x80x9d said Johnston. xe2x80x9cRyan likes to joke that he helped engineer a media company, but one of the largest challenges in scaling a local media company is in the consistency of the distribution and the content.xe2x80x9dHeafy didnxe2x80x99t bother with trying to build proprietary publishing technology, but instead cobbled together already-existing cloud products. xe2x80x9cOur IP is our playbook,xe2x80x9d he said. xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s kind of like when you buy a Subway franchise. Therexe2x80x99s this playbook for all the stuff that you have to have in your store, with rules on everything from the paint colors to the labels to how you greet your customers. We've built that for local media, and so now our ability to scale and launch in a new city in less than 60 days is locked and loaded. We can go to as many cities as we want as fast as we want, as long as we have the cash to pay for it.xe2x80x9dThe 6AM City model is fairly straightforward: every city has two editors, each trading off between writing the newsletter and community development. Heafy developed a training workflow that can bring a newly-hired editor up to speed within a matter of weeks. xe2x80x9cTheir job is to experience the city we serve and then share that experience with the community in a conversational tone,xe2x80x9d he said. The 6AM City newsletters typically steer away from politics, both local and national, and focus heavily on businesses, events, local history, and culture. The ultimate goal is to pull the local residents into the content creation process. xe2x80x9cWe like to say that the public is our publisher,xe2x80x9d said Johnston.They launched their first newsletter, GVLtoday, in Greenville. Over the next few years they expanded to Columbia, Charleston, Asheville, Chattanooga, and Raleigh. Within the last few months they debuted two new newsletters in Nashville and Richmond, and Heafy said he hopes to have newsletters live in 15 cities by the end of 2021. According to statistics on the companyxe2x80x99s website, 6AM City reaches 400,000 individual email subscribers and generates 15 million monthly impressions. Can 6AM City replace local newspapers?Given the struggles of legacy newspapers and the rising anxiety around local news xe2x80x9cdeserts,xe2x80x9d I couldnxe2x80x99t help but wonder what role 6AM City played in the delivery of local news. Both founders were adamant that they didnxe2x80x99t see their companies replacing local newspapers. xe2x80x9cWe 100% are not investigative journalists,xe2x80x9d said Heafy. xe2x80x9cWe are not trying to compete with or replace the local newspaper. We kind of describe ourselves more as like an Amazon distribution center for local content.xe2x80x9dJohnston argued that the company is complementary to local news. xe2x80x9cOne of the first things we do when moving into new cities is try to sit down and have conversations with editorial management of the local TV stations, local newspapers, radio stations and say, xe2x80x98Hey, this is how we operate. We try to really collaborate, not compete.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d And though 6AM City is advertising supported (more on that in a moment), Johnston is a real advocate for newspaper subscriptions. xe2x80x9cOne of my favorite comments from readers is when they complain that our links are to news sources that have paywalls,xe2x80x9d he said. xe2x80x9cAnd my response to that feedback is always, xe2x80x99if you clicked on a link six or seven times and then a newspaper asks you to pay, then maybe you should do just that.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d  Still, the newsletters do more than aggregate. Via their crowdsourcing, theyxe2x80x99re often the first outlets to report on businesses that are opening or closing. They amplify and contextualize government messages. They may not be sending reporters to cover city council or school board meetings, but they seem to actually influence the community around them. Johnston told me an anecdote about a regular series the newsletters run called Be the Broker. xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s a situation where maybe a landmark retail building comes up for a lease, and we crowdsource and ask everyone, xe2x80x98What business should go into this space?xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d One year a building opened up for lease in Columbia, and COLAtoday readers suggested en masse that it was the perfect place to put a popular regional restaurant chain. xe2x80x9cOne day [the restaurantxe2x80x99s] Instagram started blowing up because our readers were begging them to come to Columbia, and six months later they announced they were coming to that location. They attributed the decision specifically to the conversation we had that morning.xe2x80x9dHow to launch in a new cityI wanted to get a better sense of how 6AM City launches and grows a new newsletter, so thatxe2x80x99s why the company connected me to Erin McPherson. At the time that we spoke, she was one of two co-editors at RALtoday, but later that month she was promoted to a senior editor position at 6AM City that spans across several of its newsletters.McPherson started her career working for traditional magazines, both on the print and digital side. xe2x80x9cI wasn't super familiar with 6AM Cityxe2x80x99s products at the time that I applied, but I was really interested in learning more about what they were doing,xe2x80x9d she told me. xe2x80x9cI got hired as the launch editor for RALtoday. At the time it was their seventh city.xe2x80x9d Six weeks later they hired her co-editor Carly Delengowski.McPhersonxe2x80x99s job was thoroughly mapped out for her prior to her hiring. She started by introducing herself to several Raleigh-based organizations and businesses. These community leaders proved crucial in both supplying the newsletter with early news tips and growing its audience. And as that audience grew, both editors became hyper responsive, striving each day to operate at Inbox Zero. xe2x80x9cWe get a lot of readers on a daily basis who just will send us pictures of a sign or say, xe2x80x98Hey, I read about this, are you guys going to cover that too?xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d Much of RALtodayxe2x80x99s historical content is fed to it by readers who have lived in the city for decades. xe2x80x9cEmail is probably our biggest connection to the community,xe2x80x9d she said. xe2x80x9cAnd then Instagram also feeds into that. People will use our hashtag to tell us about businesses and restaurants opening. Companies engage with us there as well to let us know when they have news.xe2x80x9dRALtoday launched in late 2019 and saw some of its most explosive growth during the pandemic shutdowns. xe2x80x9cWe shifted from covering events, which had been a huge part of the newsletter, to providing readers with alternate ways to interact with their community,xe2x80x9d said McPherson. The newsletter maintained an updated list of restaurants with heated patios. It also kept readers abreast of new restrictions mandated by the state and city.MonetizationIn February of this year, 6AM City announced it had received a seed investment round that would help accelerate its expansion into more cities. But the company isnxe2x80x99t one of those startups that dragged its feet on monetization; from its very first day it built an aggressive advertising operation that mostly relies on native ads within the newsletter itself. xe2x80x9cWe have a lot of local and regional advertisers that advertise either in one or more of our cities,xe2x80x9d said Heafy. The mix is heavily indexed on hospitality, tourism, grocery, and real estate companies. Local organizations generate about 80% of advertising revenue.The remaining 20% are national direct-to-consumer brands, the kind that will often offer up discount codes and ship directly to your door (think Casper mattresses and Blue Apron meal kits). xe2x80x9cOnce we crossed the quarter million subscriber threshold, we saw a pivot to more national interest in direct advertising with us,xe2x80x9d said Heafy. xe2x80x9cWe've been told by folks that when we get to the 500,000 subscriber mark, it will be an even bigger game-changing opportunity for us to pick up some more of these bigger national brands.xe2x80x9d In the early days, the newsletter editors were responsible for writing the ad content, but 6AM City eventually hired a team to handle it. Is 6AM City the future of local news?Whenever you read about the struggles of legacy newspapers, you see a lot of complaints about the unfair monopoly powers wielded by tech giants like Facebook and Google, but I rarely hear complaints about these platforms when speaking to the entrepreneurs behind local news startups like 6AM City. xe2x80x9cIf you look at Facebook's local content, it is so bad,xe2x80x9d said Heafy, referring to Facebookxe2x80x99s local news widget it launched a few years ago. xe2x80x9cWe're not concerned. They would be better off acquiring us to launch in all the different markets versus what they're putting out there right now. If you look at the local content that's aggregated, it's typically homicides, car accidents, and national news. Their algorithm is elevating clickbait, and it's not necessarily elevating value. I think that's a problem for those bigger platforms.xe2x80x9dWhile everyone I spoke to for this article assured me that 6AM City wasnxe2x80x99t replacing the local newspaper, it was hard to ignore the level of community engagement that these newsletters spurred xe2x80x94 the kind of engagement that legacy newspapers need to attract if they are to survive. xe2x80x9cI think with the way that consumer reading habits are shifting, our product is providing that experience within a framework that actually still fits into people's daily routines,xe2x80x9d said McPherson. The similarities hadnxe2x80x99t been lost on her. xe2x80x9cWe've received a lot of feedback across different cities where people write in and say, xe2x80x98you know, this is the closest thing I've experienced in a while to just having my cup of coffee and reading the newspaper.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d  Do you like this newsletter?Then you should subscribe here:Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist living in Washington, DC.

I'm Simon Owens and this is my media newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:Letxe2x80x99s jump right into itxe2x80xa6From the article:To create new value, publishing needs to unbundle and then rebundle in much more rational ways. The destruction of the cable bundle was a necessary and messy step. Wexe2x80x99ve seen the start of the unbundling of publishing with Substack. The defection of many well-known writers heralds the needed collapse of the op-ed pages. But the people who dismiss Substack and newsletters as just hot takes sound a lot to me like the people in the early 2000s who dismissed bloggers as dudes in their parentsxe2x80x99 basement with pizza stains on their t-shirts and a desperate need for vitamin D. How things start are not how they end.I agree. We're only at the beginning stages of the unbundling of media. In fact, I would separate media unbundling into three distinct stages:Unbundling 1.0: This is the phase wexe2x80x99re currently in xe2x80x94 what I would call the Substack Era. Star journalists and columnists are quitting their mainstream media jobs and leveraging their huge Twitter followings to drive paid subscriptions to their own standalone platforms. Theyxe2x80x99re no longer content to subsidize the work of their less-experienced colleagues.  Unbundling 2.0: The universe of writers who have enough clout to amass 1,000 paying subscribers in a short period of time is extremely small. Because of this, wexe2x80x99ll start to see more and more writers pool their resources and form flotillas that will minimize risk. In some cases, this will come in the form of writer collectives like Defector, Every, and the Discourse Blog. But wexe2x80x99ll also see other interesting forms of experimentation, like the Sidechannel Discord server. Eventually, new startups aimed at facilitating these collaborations will launch. Several months ago I interviewed the founder of a company called Lede, which helped both Defector and the Discourse Blog build their publishing platforms. Unbundling 3.0: Eventually, traditional media companies will recognize the Great Unbundling as a legitimate threat to their businesses. Theyxe2x80x99ll grow tired of building and nurturing talent, only for that talent to defect once itxe2x80x99s reached maximum value. So mainstream media outlets will begin to restructure their relationships with creators in order to incentivize them to stay. Forbes, for instance, is rolling out a newsletter program in which it pays advances to star writers and then shares subscription revenue with them. A former Vanity Fair editor is raising money to launch an outlet that employs a similar model. Tag Nxe2x80x99 Brag distributes its content to over 100,000 followers across YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Itxe2x80x99s also convinced dozens of hunting apparel companies to sign year-long, exclusive contracts to have their products featured in its videos.In a recent interview, one of its cofounders walked me through how he and his brother built this business.To access this case study and others like it, you need to become a paying subscriber to this newsletter. By doing so, youxe2x80x99ll not only receive these case studies in your inbox, but youxe2x80x99ll also be supporting the production of the free newsletter and podcast.

Click on the link below and get a 10% discount for the first year:Get 10% off for 1 yearFrom the article:TikTok assigned individual managers to thousands of stars to help with everything, whether tech support or college tuition, inspiring a sense of loyalty among creators.From the article:The earliest users of Clubmarket's marketplace include some of the founders of the biggest clubs on Clubhouse, which range in topics from entrepreneurship to mental health to pet care. Brands can work directly with clubs and their owners xe2x80xa6 Creators can apply to become part of Clubmarket's platform through its website. The digital-marketplace software is not fully developed, so Clubmarket's team is coordinating sponsorships themselves over emails and calls.There are more and more marketplaces opening up that make it easier for brands and creators to link up.From the article:At Defector, which has 37,000 subscribers, every staffer has the same base salary, as well as a separate, role-specific target salary that depends on the company bringing in a set amount of money.This is a fascinating look at the world of pirating websites and how they monetize.From the article:A new film and streaming upstart called Creator Plus (styled \"Creator+\") has raised $12 million to produce long-form movies starring influencers. The startup, cofounded by Next 10 Ventures' Benjamin Grubbs and investor Jonathan Shambroom, says it will produce six feature films this year. The movies will air on a new streaming platform the company created starting in 2022. To watch a film, users pay per view rather than paying a monthly subscription fee for access. The company said the price for a film rental will be roughly the cost of a movie ticket, and that creators get a cut of any sales generated. It plans to spend low seven-figure budgets on each project.This'll be an interesting startup to watch. I always thought Quibi should have invested much more in influencers. It could have paid a fraction of the cost and still probably would have converted many more subscribers.From the article:To track the engagement of its readers, the Financial Times calculates a metric through the recency of visits, frequency of visits and volume of articles read (RFV). If this number drops below a certain cohort-based threshold, the publication might deploy tactics designed to stimulate engagement xe2x80xa6xe2x80xa6 Subscribers with low RFV scores whose renewal period is impending might receive an email from the Financial Times, presenting them with statistics about their site engagement. The email might show them how many articles theyxe2x80x99ve read, on which topics, written by which authors and for how long. The point, said Spooner, is to demonstrate the value of their subscription.The most successful subscription publishers are building out really sophisticated retention strategies.This is a good rundown of all of Applexe2x80x99s newly announced podcast subscription features.I donxe2x80x99t think itxe2x80x99s hyperbole to say this is a major step forward in the evolution of podcasting. Itxe2x80x99s the first example of a major podcast player allowing for every creator to launch a paid subscription offering within the app itself. Prior to this, podcasters needed to use third party platforms like Patreon and Supporting Cast. This created a sub par user experience, since paying subscribers need to figure out how to get a customized RSS feed imported into their podcast player of choice. Not only that, but this customized feed operates separately from the main feed of the show xe2x80x94 meaning that the paid episodes donxe2x80x99t appear next to the free episodes. Even worse, these customized RSS feeds donxe2x80x99t work on streaming platforms like Spotify and Pandora.Apple Podcast subscriptions will create a seamless experience within the app itself, allowing paid and free episodes to appear within the same space. Whatxe2x80x99s more, Apple already has millions of credit cards on file, so subscribing is only a single thumbprint away.This is a great example of Apple zigging where Spotify zagged. The latter spent hundreds of millions of dollars to lock down stars like Joe Rogan and the Obamas. Rather than relying on big headliner exclusives, Apple is essentially launching thousands of them, big and small. Podcasters will collectively broadcast to their millions of listeners that, in order to access their premium content, they need to use the Apple Podcast app.Of course, not all podcasters will be enticed into trying out this new tool. There are a few downsides, namely:Cost: Apple is taking a 30% cut of every transaction for the first year and 15% after that. Platforms like Patreon and Substack take 5-10%. Lack of control: The relationship between customer and podcaster is completely facilitated by the Apple ecosystem, meaning the podcasters donxe2x80x99t have access to even basic information, including subscriber email addresses. iOS exclusivity: This is the biggest sticking point for me and the reason Ixe2x80x99ll probably never test out Apple Podcast subscriptions: the app isnxe2x80x99t available on Android. More than half of the worldxe2x80x99s smartphones run on Android, and I just canxe2x80x99t imagine a scenario where I would willingly exclude them from accessing my content.Of course, Spotify is working on its own creator subscription tool, and it has the added benefit of being available on both iOS and Android. Whatxe2x80x99s more, Spotify is also building out its own programmatic ad network that it plans to open up to all podcasters. Whatxe2x80x99s that mean for Apple? If it wants to maintain any real momentum in podcast subscriptions, it needs to launch an Android version of its app. Then you should subscribe here:Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist living in Washington, DC.

As you mentioned, what Forbes is doing is one of the bet examples. Abrazo desde Mxc3xa9xico.

Once you arrive, youxe2x80x99ll find a range of channels organized by publication, along with some shared ones that may be of interest to all. (There is a lounge for chatting, for example, and a room to post jobs of interest.)Over the past year, wexe2x80x99ve seen many indie writers team up together to cross pollinate  their audiences so they can grow more quickly. In some cases, they launched bundled subscriptions at reduced prices. In other instances, they formed writer-owned cooperatives. The theory behind these experiments boils down to this: building an audience and business model by yourself is hard, so letxe2x80x99s team up to make it a little easier.The problem with these types of cooperatives is that they entangle your business with someone elsexe2x80x99s. What happens if you partner with someone on a bundled subscription and then, three months into it, they stop writing new content? Do they still get half the money? How do you account for the fact that some writers will bring in more paid subscribers than others?To solve these issues, the cooperatives often install rules that use a bunch of complicated math to determine writer payouts. But not every indie newsletter creator is going to want to enter into these sophisticated agreements just so they can grow a little faster.Thatxe2x80x99s what I love about this new experiment outlined in the link above: these writers arenxe2x80x99t offering a bundled subscription, but are rather launching a community forum that their existing subscribers can join. All the writers are sharing value without exposing their existing businesses to any sort of riskUnder this framework, a participating writer can leave the community without harming the rest of the group. It would also be easy to onboard new newsletter writers who want to participate.I could see how this model could be especially beneficial for creators within narrow niches. Letxe2x80x99s say you have five writers who run crypto investing newsletters. Itxe2x80x99s easy to imagine how their subscribers would benefit from joining a joint forum thatxe2x80x99s much more intimate than Reddit or other massive community platforms. And as the community grows, it serves as a more enticing reason for crypto investors to subscribe to one of the participating newsletters so they can gain access.I subscribe to Nick Quahxe2x80x99s Hot Pod, one of the participating newsletters, so I look forward to joining the Sidechannel Discord and seeing if it generates real value.

From the article:Former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter's new media venture, Air Mail, expects to employ 40 people by year's end, up from 30 today and 10 at launch in 2019, Axios has learned. It currently has over 75 editorial contributors.xe2x80xa6While some have criticized the outlet as a nostalgic attempt to recreate print online, its strategy has helped the company seamlessly transition into new revenue streams like e-commerce, where brand authority is important.Air Mail is an interesting company to watch because it's essentially a newsletter that's trying its best to recreate the experience of an old-school, glossy print magazine.  From the article:DraftKings has hired Brian Angiolet, former senior vice president and chief business officer at Verizon, as the companyxe2x80x99s first-ever chief media officer.Details: Angiolet will lead a team responsible for evaluating potential media acquisitions and content efforts, sources tell Axios. The team will help vet future deals and content partnerships that the company will use to help drive customer referrals to its sportsbook.I'm beginning to think that sports media is entering a gambling-fueled bubble. Not a week goes by without either a major acquisition or VC investment predicated on the idea that relaxed gambling regulations will trigger a major boom in sports betting.Will that boom actually happen? Almost certainly. But this rapid expansion reminds me of the early 2010s when media companies took their Facebook-fueled, hockeystick growth and used it to raise billions of dollars at sky-high valuations. As with most media business models, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.From the article:Liberated Syndication Inc., the industryxe2x80x99s leading podcast hosting platform, today announced the acquisition of Glow, a leading podcast monetization platform that enables podcasters to build membership programs and generate listener-supported revenue. Glowxe2x80x99s membership technology, which includes private feed distribution and subscription billing, will allow podcasters on Libsynxe2x80x99s 75,000+ podcasts to benefit from new monetization features and tap into significant new revenue streams.Libsyn acquired a podcast membership platform mere weeks after it acquired a podcast ad tech platform. It knows that if it's going to compete with Spotify's Anchor  -- a free product -- it needs to start helping podcasters make money.From the article:Substack has captivated an anxious industry because it embodies larger forces and contradictions. For one, the new media economy promises both to make some writers rich and to turn others into the content-creation equivalent of Uber drivers, even as journalists turn increasingly to labor unions to level out pay scales.The anxiety over Substack is really an anxiety about a massive shift in power within journalism. A small number of writers have been able to escape the harsh economics of digital journalism, leaving the rest of their colleagues behind.From the article:Google said it will prioritize product reviews that feature information gathered through hands-on evaluation of the product, rather than aggregated information about it. The move stands to hurt publishers, especially those that have found success in aggregating product reviews.Most publishers have launched or expanded their ecommerce operations over the last few years in an effort to diversify their revenue streams and leverage their high SEO value. But therexe2x80x99s a wide range of quality among outlets.Publishers like BuzzFeed and The New York Times have made pretty significant investments in their ecommerce content. BuzzFeed has actually rolled out its own custom-designed products and NYT extensively tests products before recommending them on Wirecutter.Many other publishers, however, simply aggregate deals and reviews from outside platforms, providing little in additional value. But because their article pages rank high in search results, theyxe2x80x99ve still benefited from the ecommerce boom caused by the pandemic lockdowns.It looks like Google has caught on to their game, though, and the partyxe2x80x99s about to be over.

Most people probably assume that a lawyer writes each contract from scratch, but in reality the lawyer is most likely copy and pasting clauses and sections from already-existing contracts and modifying them for their particular client.One of the resources lawyers often turn to for this is Law Insider. Founded in 2010, Law Insider indexes the millions of contracts that have been uploaded to the SEC website by publicly traded companies. It generates over 4 million monthly pageviews and has over 250,000 registered users, about 5,000 of whom pay $30 a month to access its archives.I recently interviewed the sitexe2x80x99s co-founder Preston Clark about how he and his partners came up with the idea, what they did to build up its massive audience, and why theyxe2x80x99re expanding into a full-fledged media company that produces everything from articles to YouTube videos.To listen to the interview, subscribe to The Business of Content on your favorite podcast player. If you scroll down youxe2x80x99ll also find some transcribed highlights from the interview.iTunes/ Stitcher/  Overcast/ Spotify/ Google/ YouTube/ AudibleThis transcript has been edited for clarity.The launch of Law InsiderPreston started his career as an in-house lawyer before moving on to a job selling SaaS products. xe2x80x9cThrough my role as a salesperson, I got to know several legal technology startups like Rocket Lawyer and LegalZoom. I realized that these sites,  in very simple ways, have started aggregating publicly available legal information. And it got me thinking, what if we really went deep on this and tried to compile the world's largest contract database, and then if we could get smart with the data and how we organized search, we could potentially build something lawyers would actually use.xe2x80x9dGiven his background as a lawyer, Preston knew that there was huge demand for access to already-existing legal contracts. xe2x80x9cLawyers draft contracts the same way a business person drafts a contract, which is you don't start with a blank piece of paper. You're always starting with something, a template of a contract you used previously, a contract you got from a friend or a colleague, and so aggregating everything seemed like a really, really valuable resource. But in order for it to ultimately work, you'd have to really have a high level of adoption.xe2x80x9d Most lawyers turn to Google when searching for contracts, so whatever site Preston and his cofounders launched would require several months for its content to get adequately indexed within search engine results. So where would Law Insider find a large database of contracts? There was one obvious candidate: the SEC. xe2x80x9cPublicly traded companies need to publish material documents to their business. Some of those are press releases, some of those are financial filings, and some of them are contracts. It turns out a lot of them are contracts. We found a way to extract and aggregate and organize those contracts. We weren't the first to do it, we haven't been the last, we just think we've been the most focused on it. This is all we do. All we do is contracts. Wexe2x80x99re adding thousands of documents every month.xe2x80x9dThey launched Law Insider in 2010 and ran it as a side hustle for several years. As the repository got bigger, the site received more and more traffic. They eventually began aggregating contracts from other government websites. xe2x80x9cWe now rank in the first page for literally tens of thousands of keywords. In many cases we'll rank not just in the first two spots, we'll rank on all 10 spots on the first page of Google, because it's such a long tail that we've developed over the years.xe2x80x9dMonetizationWithin a few years, Law Insider was generating millions of pageviews a month, and its founders began to think more deeply about how to monetize it. They started by installing a registration wall that required frequent users of the site to register with their email address. Law Insider quickly amassed a fairly large mailing list. xe2x80x9cAnd then about two years ago we flipped the switch on a premium membership model.xe2x80x9dHow did it work? xe2x80x9cIt's all integrated into the experience. The best analog for our business is Shutterstock. You go online, you conduct a Google search for a guy on his phone, you see a bunch of images of a guy on a phone, all of which have watermarks. You click on one of those watermarked photos and end up on  Shutterstockxe2x80x99s website, which gives you some options. You can download this one image for X dollars, or you can upgrade your subscription and get all the images you want, or some variation of that. And that's effectively what we did.xe2x80x9d Basically, if someone lands on Law Insiderxe2x80x99s site, theyxe2x80x99re allowed to download a few contracts for free. xe2x80x9cBut there are thousands of people who need more than that. And those are the people who wexe2x80x99re trying to build a subscription around. They get some value for free, and at some point we say, xe2x80x98start a free trial.xe2x80x99 A trial goes between seven days and 30 days, but it's typically seven. And if you continue on after your trial, then it's $30 a month, or $250 a year. And that's the simplicity of it.xe2x80x9dItxe2x80x99s been about two years since Law Insider launched the paid membership. xe2x80x9cWe're close to 5,000 active paying subscribers now. The growth rate is good. We have a churn problem for sure, but we got from zero to 5,000 in two years, so the churn problem isn't preventing us from growing at a healthy rate. It's just preventing us from blowing up, and so we have to solve it.xe2x80x9dExpanding beyond contracts Now that Law Insider is generating revenue, itxe2x80x99s able to expand into new verticals, including editorial content. xe2x80x9cThere are so many adjacent stories and educational materials that we can pack into this. As someone who did a lot of content marketing earlier in my career, it's just so exciting, because now we can start telling the stories and building use cases around our ideal customer profile and moving people through an engagement journey with us in a way that is much more proactive than just waiting there for them to download another document.xe2x80x9dLaw Insider isnxe2x80x99t just creating article content; it recently launched a YouTube show called Contract Teardown. xe2x80x9cWe totally stole this idea from a company called ProfitWell that does pricing analytics and consulting for SaaS companies. They'll look at how a company like HubSpot or Salesforce prices its services and whether or not itxe2x80x99s adopting a good pricing strategy.xe2x80x9d Contract Teardown does something similar, except itxe2x80x99s analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of contracts signed by major corporations. xe2x80x9cSo many lawyers have strong opinions about very specific documents or provisions, and we bring them on, we give them a platform, and we have a host thatxe2x80x99s tearing down an agreement and walking through what aspects of it are good or bad, or could have been drafted better.xe2x80x9dLaw Insider has only recently begun to experiment with this kind of editorial content, but so far the engagement is encouraging. xe2x80x9cEach video gets anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 views. We get a really good response from our subscribers. We're just at the beginning stages of this, but we feel good about it.xe2x80x9d Do you like this newsletter?Then you should subscribe here:Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist living in Washington, DC.

I'm Simon Owens and this is my media newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:Over the past few years Ixe2x80x99ve encountered various cases in which publishers attempted to drive subscriptions/memberships by running what could be described as NPR-style pledge drives.The specific strategies can vary, but in most cases the publisher, for some period of time ranging anywhere from a week to a month, will cut its subscription prices while simultaneously bombarding the audience with a large volume of messages encouraging them to subscribe.  Why do this? Because a lot of potential subscribers arenxe2x80x99t all that eager to hand over their credit card information, and a concentrated nudge that only occurs once or twice a year can be just enough to tip them over the edge.The idea always made logical sense to me, and a few months ago I began to think about what a pledge drive would look like for me. I launched a paid version of this newsletter on February 19, and I decided I wanted to launch the drive at the six-month mark, which was almost exactly a month ago.So how did I design the pledge month? And more important, what kind of results did I see from it? Ixe2x80x99ll dive into all of that below.Deciding on a discountAlmost all subscription drives lead with some kind of discount; in a lot of cases, theyxe2x80x99ll slash prices by 50% or more. Ixe2x80x99ve always been a lot more conservative on this front. In my view, you can actually devalue your work by cutting prices too low, and I also donxe2x80x99t have the cash runway that would allow me to make huge upfront bets that subscribers will stick around once the discount ends.In a normal month, I offer a 10% discount for the first year, so for the pledge month I doubled it to 20%. Itxe2x80x99s big enough to generate real savings while at the same not so steep as to create sticker shock when it reverts back to the full price after the first year.Opening up about my processWhen you look at actual public radio pledge drives, youxe2x80x99ll notice they spend a significant amount of time talking about what goes on behind the scenes at the radio stations. There are two reasons for this.The first is that it establishes a more personal relationship between the listener and the station employees. Youxe2x80x99re more likely to buy a membership if you care about the people who are drawing a salary from that membership.This approach also helps the listener understand what their membership dollars are actually going toward. It can be easy for the average news consumer to forget that producing high quality journalism is expensive, so thatxe2x80x99s why pledge drive hosts spend a lot of time talking about the high impact journalism the station has broadcast over the previous 12 months.I did my own version of this by spacing out three articles over the course of the month. The first was titled xe2x80x9cThe exact time commitment it takes to run a paid newsletter.xe2x80x9d For this one I focused on detailing all the work that goes into researching and creating the free and paid newsletters, as well as my weekly podcast. My hope was to communicate to readers that this newsletter isnxe2x80x99t just a casual side gig; itxe2x80x99s actually a huge time commitment that required me to sacrifice monthly income in order to make it a reality. This article was actually my most successful for the month. It made it to the front page of Hacker News, driving over 10,000 impressions and dozens of free signups. My second article was titled xe2x80x9c4 lessons I've learned while running a paid newsletter.xe2x80x9d For this one I wanted to provide some concrete takeaways for my audience to utilize in their own content businesses while also opening up more about my newsletter business. This one didnxe2x80x99t get shared as widely on social media as the first one, but I received several email replies from people who indicated they planned to test out several of the strategies I outlined.My third article is the one youxe2x80x99re reading right now. I figured my pledge drive experiment was substantial enough that it warranted its own article, and I also thought it would be a good way to close out the pledge month. So if youxe2x80x99ve been annoyed by how much Simon Owens-focused content youxe2x80x99ve received lately, donxe2x80x99t worry because itxe2x80x99s about to be drastically reduced.Social media calls to actionIxe2x80x99ve never been one to beg on social media for people to subscribe to my newsletter. I always figured the better -- and less annoying -- tactic would be to simply lead with my content and let that drive conversions. But for the pledge month I decided to increase the amount of messaging on Twitter that encouraged people to sign up.First I created a spreadsheet of every Twitter user who encouraged their followers to sign up for my newsletter. Then, once a day I would screen capture one of those tweets and then share it on Twitter. I also threaded the tweets so people could scroll through all the recommendations all at once. Finally, I made sure to tag each user with their recommendation, which more often than not resulted in them retweeting me.Itxe2x80x99s hard to say how many signups this strategy drove, but those tweets collectively generated over 20,000 impressions, which is fairly significant.Social media adsIxe2x80x99ve read a few dozen case studies about how publishers drove newsletter signups by purchasing targeted social media ads promoting their individual articles. I didnxe2x80x99t have a huge budget for this kind of promotion, but I figured that, given the right level of targeting, I could see some decent traction without spending too much money.I chose four articles that had already performed well on social media -- one for each week of the month. I then would buy a promoted tweet optimized for website clicks, spending $50 on each article. I targeted these tweets based solely on the lookalike audiences for several prominent media reporters who cover my same beat.This strategy performed surprisingly well. Not only did the ads drive decent click-through -- which lowered my cost-per-click significantly -- but they also led to organic retweets from some blue checkmark accounts. In fact, my very last Twitter ad led to retweets from two separate accounts with over 100,000 followers each. That was definitely $200 well spent.ResultsSo those were all the steps I took this month to turbocharge my newsletter growth. So what results did I see?Letxe2x80x99s start with free signups to my newsletter. I saw an 11.6% increase to my total number. It was easily my biggest month since launching my newsletter back in 2014, and while most of those didnxe2x80x99t convert into paying subscribers, my hope is that many will in the coming weeks.The jump in paid subscriptions was much more significant: 30%. It seems like my suspicions were correct that I had a bunch of potential subscribers waiting on the sidelines who just needed a little nudge. So does that mean Ixe2x80x99d rate the experiment a success? I think Ixe2x80x99ll have a better handle on that in the next few months, since my hope was that this pledge drive would generate some momentum that I could continue to ride after it ended. In two months or so Ixe2x80x99ll be able to look back and see whether my newsletter growth rates returned to what they were prior to the pledge month, or if they picked up speed.But Ixe2x80x99m definitely encouraged by what Ixe2x80x99ve seen thus far, enough to where Ixe2x80x99d consider attempting another pledge drive in another six months or so. As I mentioned, this article marks the end of this monthxe2x80x99s pledge drive.

I'm Simon Owens and this is my media newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:I knew I wanted to build a paid newsletter long before I actually launched one. Mainly this is because itxe2x80x99s one of the few business models that caters to my particular brand of journalism. I donxe2x80x99t produce content with enough frequency to generate the scale that would attract major advertisers, and I donxe2x80x99t write about the kind of consumer products that could convert into affiliate sales. I also really liked the idea of the value exchange that a paid subscription model brings. By producing high quality, niche content, Ixe2x80x99m able to establish a longterm relationship with my audience, and Ixe2x80x99m rewarded for the value I create when my readers open up their wallets and pay me. It creates the right balance of incentives in which Ixe2x80x99m encouraged to grow a large following without succumbing to clickbait tactics.But though I knew I really wanted to pursue the paid subscription model and had done a fair amount of research on other successful paid newsletters, I also understood that building such a product would require plenty of patience, experimentation, and learning. And so when I finally launched my paid newsletter in mid-February, I did so with the understanding that my strategy would evolve over time as I learned what worked and what didnxe2x80x99t.Flash forward six months, and I feel like Ixe2x80x99ve absorbed enough lessons from the experience thus far that itxe2x80x99s worth pausing and sharing some of them. Ixe2x80x99d consider this to be Part 1 in an ongoing series where I roll back the curtain on my strategies for building a newsletter business.Here are four lessons Ixe2x80x99ve learned while running a subscription newsletter:The paid version canxe2x80x99t just offer more of the same. It needs to be different.When designing a paid offering, many writers simply assume that readers will want to pay for access to more of what theyxe2x80x99re already receiving. So the writers will publish one free newsletter per week and then pump out a few paywalled newsletters that look almost exactly like the free version in both format and content.What I think this approach fails to recognize is that your readers are already inundated with too much content. From the very moment they open their inbox in the morning to when they put their phone down at night, theyxe2x80x99re bombarded with tweets, photos, articles, videos, and podcasts. Even if they enjoy your newsletter, theyxe2x80x99re probably fine with reading it and then waiting a week until the next free issue comes out. Only your biggest superfans will be champing at the bit to subscribe and receive more. This is the trap I fell into with my own newsletter. For the first few months, the paid version was indistinguishable from the free product. Once a week Ixe2x80x99d spend a few hours writing up some analysis of the latest media industry news Ixe2x80x99d read that day. I never felt quite like I was producing all that extra value, and I even felt a little guilty asking people to shell out upwards of $10 a month for content that would quickly become outdated within a few weeks.Then one day the solution dawned on me. I was keeping a spreadsheet of all my paid subscribers, and in the spreadsheet there were three main fields I was tracking: Name, email address, and occupation. It was while scrolling through that third column that I realized that most of my paying subscribers were successful entrepreneurs and executives within the media industry -- the very industry I covered in my newsletter. I was sitting on a wealth of industry knowledge, and I just needed to figure out how to mine it in a scalable way.So I began reaching out to my paying subscribers and interviewing them, going deep on their successful ventures. I then took these transcripts and converted them into case studies with actionable intel. Here are a few examples Ixe2x80x99ve placed in front of the paywall:How a blogger sold $72,000 in ebooks over a 3-day periodThis barbecue website has 15,000 paying members and a thriving ecommerce businessHe built a massively popular newsletter by syndicating it to media outletsNot only do these case studies provide a lot more value than what I was sending out before, but theyxe2x80x99re also evergreen in nature, which means a new subscriber can immediately start diving into my archives. In essence, my subscription bundle generates more value every single week, and a year from now Ixe2x80x99ll have 50 of these stored up.I debuted the case study series about three months ago and Ixe2x80x99ve noticed a definite improvement in my free-to-paid conversions.Change up your calls to actionSo many subscription publishers recycle the same messages that urge readers to convert from free to paid subscribers. Itxe2x80x99s usually a copy-and-pasted message that they place at the top, middle, or bottom of their weekly free newsletter. I think this is a huge mistake. A user who doesnxe2x80x99t convert the first time they see a call to action probably wonxe2x80x99t convert the third time they see it. If anything, theyxe2x80x99ll simply learn to ignore it and scroll on to the next piece of free content.Think of your potential subscribers as existing on a spectrum. On the one end of the spectrum you have the person who really just wants to support you and your work. Theyxe2x80x99d subscribe even if it meant not receiving any paywalled content. On the other end of the spectrum is the person who doesnxe2x80x99t give a crap about you, they just need access to your paywalled content.Most potential subscribers will exist somewhere between these two points. You should be constantly switching up your messaging so that it appeals to various points along the spectrum.One of the best ways to convert free users into paying subscribers is by literally showing them what theyxe2x80x99re missing out on. Expose them to headlines from your paid newsletter and then couple that with different messages explaining the longterm value of a subscription. Make it nearly impossible for them to scroll past your calls to action without at least pausing to consider whether this is the week they finally hand over their credit card information.Churn will stingWhen I launched my paid newsletter, I understood intellectually that some percentage of my subscribers would cancel their subscriptions or let them lapse, but that doesnxe2x80x99t make it any less painful whenever I receive an email alerting me that someone has ended their subscription. There was one particularly bad week a few months ago when three or four subscribers canceled over a period of days. This happened to occur at the same time when my subscriber growth numbers had seemed to stall (notably, before I pivoted my paid offerings to the case study interviews). For me, it felt like I was taking two steps forward and the one step back.Unfortunately, churn is a fact of life. As any business owner can tell you, the day you start getting customers is the day you start losing them. This canxe2x80x99t be just a side hustleI think therexe2x80x99s this perception that a successful paid newsletter can be built by someone who just writes on their nights and weekends, and while Ixe2x80x99m sure it is possible, most wonxe2x80x99t achieve the level of consistent quality output needed to scale their newsletter business.Keep in mind that a successful paid newsletter requires a very steady stream of paid AND free content. Without the free content, you canxe2x80x99t get enough top-of-the-funnel signups that you can later convert to paid. And without enough paid content, your non-paying subscribers wonxe2x80x99t see any reason to convert.In a recent article, I laid out how much time I spend on each category of content every week -- my podcast, free newsletters, and paid newsletters. All together, I spend a minimum of 30 hours every week on my newsletter and podcast. Maintaining that kind of time commitment took real sacrifices; around the time I launched the paid newsletter I drastically scaled back my freelance client work, a move that decreased my monthly income drastically.Any newsletter strategy should include a plan for how youxe2x80x99ll set aside a sizable chunk of your week so you can work on it, because trying to squeeze your writing in between the time you eat dinner and the time you go to bed is going to lead to burnout pretty quickly.The subscription business is a long gameMost of the newsletter success stories you read about are outliers. A journalist with hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers quits their media job, they announce theyxe2x80x99re launching a paid newsletter, thousands rally around them, and within a month theyxe2x80x99re generating a six figure income.And if you have a huge pre-existing audience, maybe thatxe2x80x99ll also happen for you. But for the rest of us, building a subscription business is a slog. When I launched the paid version of my newsletter, Ixe2x80x99d already been operating a free version for over five years. Ixe2x80x99d been hosting my podcast for two years. I had tens of thousands of social media followers across Twitter and LinkedIn. And yet I was only able to convert a few dozen customers in my first month.Getting people to turn over their credit card information is hard. Really hard. And there are plenty of competitors out there who have much more resources and reach. Youxe2x80x99ve got to be prepared to show up every day and grow your audience one subscriber at a time. It gets easier as time goes on -- my subscriber conversions have definitely picked up recently -- but gird yourself for a years long marathon of steady content production. This is a business that rewards persistence, and the vast majority of paid newsletters will end up abandoned once writers come to understand how much work it truly takes to build one.Do you like this newsletter?Then you should subscribe here:Simon Owens is a tech and media journalist living in Washington, DC.

I'm Simon Owens and this is my media newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:When building a news subscription product, one of the most important decisions you can make is how to price it. Do you aim low with the hope that you can sell it to a mass market? Or do you jack up the price with the knowledge that your core audience is relatively price insensitive?To see this dynamic in action, look no further than The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. With my Amazon Prime subscription I get WashPo for something like $4 a month. The WSJ costs me $35 a month, or $400 a year. At those price points, the WSJ can generate 1/8th the subscriptions as WashPo and still collect the same amount of revenue, and itxe2x80x99s confident it can charge that much because of its business journalism bonafides. In fact, a huge portion of WSJ subscribers get their accounts through their jobs and might not even know how much a subscription costs. But therexe2x80x99s a third category of subscription product, one that costs its customers well into the four or even five figures each year. These services almost always rely entirely on enterprise sales; in other words, if your company isnxe2x80x99t willing to pay for it, then therexe2x80x99s little chance youxe2x80x99re handing over your personal credit card. The Bloomberg Terminal is probably the best example of this. Bloomberg LP generates billions of dollars annually simply because nearly every serious Wall Street trader pays $20,000+ a year to gain access to real-time market data and news. Politico Pro has also found success in this category, charging five figures for ultra-niche policy information to businesses that interact heavily with the federal government and its myriad agencies.But how large is the market for these super expensive subscription products, especially as more and more publishers launch their own? Fortune is the latest to throw its hat into the ring, launching a $2,500 a year xe2x80x9clearning platformxe2x80x9d thatxe2x80x99s geared toward senior executives who might otherwise attend one of its annual conferences.To start, there will be an online library of repurposed recorded conference content and a weekly newsletter. And a few weeks into October, virtual meet-ups, participatory events and xe2x80x9csprints,xe2x80x9d or condensed lessons of important topics, will kick off as well.Itxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9ca scalable platform for providing the lessons that we give at our conferences to a much broader group of executives,xe2x80x9d said Fortune CEO Alan Murray, adding that CEOs who attended conferences reported to Murrayxe2x80x99s team that the information presented would benefit emerging leaders in their companies who werenxe2x80x99t at the high enough level to attend the conferences themselves.I get the appeal of products like this; you can generate pretty sizable revenue with relatively few customers. But I remain pretty skeptical that very many publishers will be able to play in this arena before it becomes incredibly saturated. The universe of businesses that have the resources to pay for annual $2,500-per-person subscriptions is relatively small, and the sales conversion process is a lot more labor intensive.Publishers like The Wall Street Journal and WashPo can lead with their content, meaning that the typical sales conversion takes place when a user attempts to access a piece of important information and canxe2x80x99t. But products that cost thousands of dollars a year usually require an actual sales force to close deals. What this means in practice is that the person who approves the purchase is different from the person actually consuming the content. This throws all the efficiencies of scale the internet affords out the window.All of which is to say, I wish Fortune the best of luck, but Ixe2x80x99ll need to see some cold, hard subscription numbers before declaring this product a financial success.All across the world, thousands of entrepreneurs are experimenting with ways to solve the local news crisis. Some have launched local blogs. Other built town-focused networks. Still others debuted daily newsletters. Quite a few local news startups these days are nonprofits. But Alec Saelens and a few of his colleagues decided to try out a very specific model: a media cooperative. These involve group ownership, not just among the publicationxe2x80x99s staff, but also the local community members as well.A few years ago, they launched The Bristol Cable, an investigative news startup that boasts on its membership page that xe2x80x9cthere are no majority shareholders or commercial investors, and we do not accept corporate advertising.xe2x80x9d It currently has 2,100 paying members.I interviewed Alec about why they settled on the media cooperative model, how they found their first stakeholders, and what impact that publication has had on the Bristol community.To access this case study and others like it, you need to become a paying subscriber to this newsletter. By doing so, youxe2x80x99ll not only receive these case studies in your inbox, but youxe2x80x99ll also be supporting the production of the free newsletter and podcast. You get awesome content thatxe2x80x99ll help you in your career and youxe2x80x99ll be supporting an independent creator. For the next few weeks Ixe2x80x99m running a special discount that will get you 20% off for the first year.Get 20% off for 1 yearIxe2x80x99ve written in the past about how the xe2x80x9cAdpocalypsexe2x80x9d -- changes to YouTubexe2x80x99s ad platform that drastically reduced many creatorsxe2x80x99 earnings -- forced YouTubers to become more savvy business people and diversify their revenue streams. Within a year, most creators had launched brand collaborations, subscription products, and lots of merchandise offerings.In those early days, launching a merch line usually just meant slapping your logo onto a t-shirt and then selling it through some print-on-demand service like CafePress or Teespring. But as the merch market has become more saturated and competitive, wexe2x80x99ve been seeing more sophisticated product rollouts that aim for real differentiation within the market.Logan Paulxe2x80x99s Maverick is a good example. Itxe2x80x99s not just a logo applied to a bunch of products. Itxe2x80x99s a custom-designed fashion line and community. Paul has purchased LA billboards promoting it and wove it into the fabric of his daily vlog. He invites Maverick customers on the channel and is erecting an entire community around the brand.In a recent interview, he revealed that it generated between $30 and $40 million in just its first year. xe2x80x9cIt was the first time I really understood the power of a creator and being able to move an audience outside of a platform. Except now xe2x80x94 I mean, wexe2x80x99re all feeling this, all creators xe2x80x94 merch is so oversaturated. Itxe2x80x99s not the thing anymore. There a few creators, like the Nelk boys xe2x80x94 who are having their $30, $40, $50, $60 million years, and probably MrBeast, too xe2x80x94 but besides them, its such a hard industry to break.xe2x80x9dAs the programmatic advertising market continues to collapse, wexe2x80x99re going to continue to see more product-content integration all across the media industry, from independent creators to large publishing companies. This is the world that paltry CPMs have wrought. I have a secret Facebook group thatxe2x80x99s only promoted to subscribers of this newsletter.

Over the span of a decade, he started and abandoned several of them, often before they had a chance to amass much of an audience. But in 2011 he got more serious about audience growth for a blog he ran that focused on teaching standup comedians how to market themselves, and to help drive traffic to it he launched a newsletter.Pretty quickly, he grew addicted to the newsletter medium, and a few years later he merged a couple of newsletters he was running into a single list and renamed it For the Interested. Since 2016, hexe2x80x99s been sending out new issues each week featuring ideas to help creators to produce, promote, and profit from their creations. For the Interested now has over 25,000 subscribers, and Josh recently launched a paid spinoff newsletter.I recently interviewed Josh about how he grew his audience, the role his newsletter plays in his consulting business, and why he thinks so many writers are approaching paid newsletters the wrong way.To listen to the interview, subscribe to The Business of Content on your favorite podcast player. If you scroll down youxe2x80x99ll also find some transcribed highlights from the interview.iTunes/ Stitcher/ Google Play/ Overcast/ Spotify/ Google/ YouTubeThis transcript has been edited for clarity.How Josh first got interested in newslettersIn the early 2010s, Josh was operating a blog that taught standup comedians how to market themselves. xe2x80x9cI basically had three different things going that were each unique, but had some overlap. One was I had a newsletter that was really just from my personal website. That had a few thousand people on it. I had the website giving marketing and social media tips for comedians. And that had a few thousand people. And I had a website/newsletter that I had launched called The Person You Should Know. On that one, I  would just feature a different notable person every day with a mini profile explaining why theyxe2x80x99re interesting. So all three of those had a couple thousand of subscribers and I just realized I was spread too thin and wanted to figure out a way to just have one newsletter and have a flexible enough format combining the three things.xe2x80x9dAnd so he combined all three lists into For The Interested. xe2x80x9cThe through line is it's all advice to help people better produce, promote, and profit from their creations. So I took in some the strategies of audience growth and monetization that I was doing just with comedians and expanded the advice for all creators, businesses, and entrepreneur types. That was about four years ago. I published it every Sunday. This week was the 215th week in a row, which is hard to believe.xe2x80x9d***Like this article so far?

Subscribe over here:Ok, back to our scheduled programmingxe2x80xa6***How Josh grew his newsletter audienceJoshxe2x80x99s newsletter is mostly curational, in that it links to outside content. So how does he get people to sign up for it if the newsletter itself doesnxe2x80x99t contain much original writing? He also publishes a weekly article to his blog that features calls to action for readers to sign up to his newsletter. xe2x80x9cYou have to be consistent. I think it's a long game. The idea, especially when it comes to newsletters, is they're not going to grow overnight. It just takes time. I personally believe that if you want to grow a newsletter, you have to publish at least once every two weeks.xe2x80x9dJosh has also bought ads and formed partnerships with other newsletters. xe2x80x9cI'm not a huge fan of Facebook at the moment, but in the past I've run Facebook ads. I've had some success with that. One quick note on that is when I've done it, I don't run ads just saying xe2x80x98subscribe to this newsletter.xe2x80x99 I would run ads promoting one of my original blog posts, and then within that have plugs for the newsletter. I've done cross promotions with other newsletter creators. That certainly can work well if it's a good match in terms of audience.xe2x80x9dJosh has seen some traction from cross-posting his articles for Medium. xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99ve gotten a lot of subscribers from people who didn't know I existed, but found it on Medium and then subscribed that way.xe2x80x9d He places the articles behind Mediumxe2x80x99s metered paywall, which allows him to generate additional revenue. xe2x80x9cIn the past year, I made between $400 to $1,500 a month. Ixe2x80x99m not going to retire on that, but it's pretty good for a simple syndication channel.xe2x80x9dHow Josh designed his paid newsletterRecently, Josh launched a paid subscription newsletter called This Is How I Do It. xe2x80x9cIt is a weekly email where I literally just share a breakdown of exactly how I do something in my own business, content creation, et cetera. So whether it's how I write emails, engage with clients, or give feedback, that kind of thing.xe2x80x9d Josh is a big believer that paid newsletters should offer something different from their free versions. xe2x80x9cI see a lot of cases where the paid version of their newsletter is essentially more, so you get one free issue, but if you pay, you get three issues a week or whatever it is, and I increasingly believe that people don't want more, they want different, and that even if they love your newsletter, they don't just want more emails.xe2x80x9dJosh offered both a monthly and annual rate. xe2x80x9cI offer it as a monthly subscription for $20 a month or an annual subscription for $120 a year. As you can tell by that pricing, I wanted to nudge people towards the annual rate, and that is what has happened. I've been really happy with that. It's almost a two to one ratio of people subscribing for annual versus monthly, so that that's been really encouraging. It's still early, but I feel like I'm headed down the right path.xe2x80x9d Did you like this article?Do you want me to create awesome content like this for you?

I'm Simon Owens and this is my media newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:For the past 15 years or so, dozens of media companies have tried to design the perfect platisher model. A portmanteau of the words xe2x80x9cpublisherxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cplatform,xe2x80x9d a platisher hypothetically combines the scalability afforded by user generated content with the prestige journalism produced by traditional media outlets.I say xe2x80x9chypotheticallyxe2x80x9d because most platisher strategies have been widely derided within the media industry, to the point where the term is often thrown around as a tongue-in-cheek pejorative. Critics argue that the more you hand over content production to the crowd, the more it undermines the integrity of your journalism. It also subjects your site to all sorts of manipulation by shady characters who will leverage your publicationxe2x80x99s good name to push through unethical, conflict-ridden content.But while the platisher model presents an ethical and reputational minefield, I think one company has done a reasonably good job of navigating its pitfalls: Medium. The Ev Williams-led company has wedded the traditional journalism youxe2x80x99d find at most magazines with the scalable content production and monetization thatxe2x80x99s thus far only been achieved by tech platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. And while it hasnxe2x80x99t attracted universal respect from the media industry, many journalists are watching its progress with some hopeful optimism. To understand how Medium solved this model, itxe2x80x99s helpful to look back at past platisher models and examine why they struggled to gain respectability in the marketplace. Specifically, I want to look at the contributor programs at both HuffPost and Forbes.HuffPostWhile Arianna Huffington didnxe2x80x99t invent the platisher model (other platform-like blogs like Daily Kos and MyDD were founded earlier), she certainly brought it into the mainstream. You had to officially be invited into its contributor network, but the vetting was pretty loose, usually requiring that you merely knew someone at the site. Huffington famously got A-list celebrities to blog for free, but she also handed out accounts to random people she met while traveling. At its peak, the contributor network had 100,000 bloggers, though itxe2x80x99s unclear how many were blogging on a month to month basis.That contributor network lent HuffPost a level of traffic scale not available to most blogs in the mid-2000s. At the time, mainstream media companies were only beginning to take the internet seriously, and as outlets like The New York Times and Washington Post started to struggle amid cratering print ad sales, some wondered whether HuffPost would become the first great newspaper founded in the 21st century. It was able to ride this hype and scale to a $315 million AOL acquisition in 2011.With AOLxe2x80x99s resources at its disposal, HuffPost went on a hiring spree, sniping journalists from top tier outlets. In 2012, it won a Pulitzer for its reporting on wounded veterans returning home from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. There were also occasional scoops from its contributor network. Mayhill Fowler, a then 61-year-old stay-at-home mother, published two blockbuster stories during the 2008 primary season, the first when she recorded then-candidate Obama at a fundraiser claiming that conservative xe2x80x9cclingxe2x80x9d to their guns and religion, and the second when she recorded an unhinged rant from Bill Clinton.But the contributor network also provided plenty of headaches for Huffington. From almost the very beginning, she was dogged by criticism that she was profiting off the back of unpaid bloggers. I always found this criticism a little unfair -- after all, nobody criticized Facebook or Twitter for not paying users for all their content -- but it provided constant fodder for whenever old media fogeys wanted to take some shots at the site. In 2010, Fowler famously quit writing for the publication after she made the case that Huffington should pay her and Huffington refused. In 2011, some contributors filed a class action lawsuit alleging they were owed part of the money paid out in the AOL acquisition. The lawsuit was later tossed out by a judge, but it was still used as a battering ram for those who liked to criticize Huffington for devaluing journalism.Whatxe2x80x99s worse, HuffPost was never able to erect a true social graph. Really, the only way for a contributorxe2x80x99s article to receive traffic was if an editor featured it on the homepage, and many unpaid bloggers grew discouraged as they toiled away in obscurity. Because of this dynamic, the sitexe2x80x99s scale was always limited, and its hockey stick traffic growth eventually plateaued as legacy media companies beefed up their online operations.Ultimately, the contributorxe2x80x99s network ended up being more trouble than it was worth. In 2018, editor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen, Ariannaxe2x80x99s successor, shut down the network completely. xe2x80x9cOpen platforms that once seemed radically democratizing now threaten, with the tsunami of false information we all face daily, to undermine democracy,xe2x80x9d Polgreen wrote in a blog post at the time. xe2x80x9cWhen everyone has a megaphone, no one can be heard.xe2x80x9d ForbesWhen Forbes launched its contributor network in 2010, it was clear that it had learned from some of HuffPostxe2x80x99s mistakes. That same year Forbes acquired Lewis DVorkinxe2x80x99s startup True/Slant and installed DVorkin as Chief Product Officer. True/Slantxe2x80x99s model involved paying its writers a portion of ad revenue based on the traffic they generated, and he instituted a similar model when he recruited several hundred business influencers and journalists to blog for Forbes.The contract Forbes contributors signed was pretty straightforward. If you published a certain number of articles per month, you received an upfront payment of a few hundred dollars, and then you generated additional income based on the amount of traffic your articles attracted. Though the rates varied over the years, one contributor in 2014 told me she received a half cent per unique view and five cents for repeat visitors. The network eventually ballooned up to 1,800 writers (not all of these were under the revenue share contracts, but many were), and it pulled down some real wins, both for the company and the writers themselves. From the time it launched until  2014, it increased its monthly unique visitors by 19.5 million. Advertising revenue grew by 35% during this same time period, and then-CEO Mike Perlis later credited Dvorkin with saving the struggling magazine. And how did this work out for the writers? Dvorkin revealed in a 2014 post that xe2x80x9c60 [contributors] made as much or more in 2013 than the $45,250 a year the Bureau of Labor Statistics says is the nationwide average for a professional reporter or correspondent. Five or so have built big enough loyal audiences xe2x80xa6 to top $100,000. Many dozens more make between $10,000 and $25,000.xe2x80x9dBut people quickly began to notice the contributor network was eroding Forbesxe2x80x99s journalistic brand. Most of the writers werenxe2x80x99t journalists, after all, and they were paid based on an advertising ecosystem that rewarded clickbait. xe2x80x9cForbes has blurred the lines more than any other mainstream publisher between journalistic content and marketing/PR,xe2x80x9d wrote The Columbia Journalism Review in 2014. xe2x80x9cFlacky garbage written by marketing executives and consultants is barely distinguishable at first glance from reported stories written by staff writers.xe2x80x9d Even journalism prof Jeff Jarvis, whoxe2x80x99s typically bullish on citizen journalism models, panned the network. xe2x80x9cNow, when I see a link to Forbes on Twitter, I donxe2x80x99t know whether it is going to take me to (1) the good work of a Forbes journalists, (2) the good work of a Forbes contributor, (3) the bad work of one of many Forbes contributors, or (4) the paid and wordy shilling of a Forbes advertiser,xe2x80x9d he wrote on BuzzMachine.  Forbes basically ran up against the problem every platisher eventually faces: as the number of content creators expands, quality control gets more difficult. With 1,500+ writers, itxe2x80x99s impossible to police for things like conflicts of interest. Working in the PR and marketing world, Ixe2x80x99m aware of at least a few cases in which executives with Forbes blogs interviewed their own clients or client prospects. In 2016, a PR executive posted a redacted screen capture of a Forbes writer soliciting payment in exchange for coverage. Sometimes, Forbes was forced to pull down contributor posts, as it did in 2014 when a columnist claimed that drunk women were the gravest threat to fraternities.Eventually Forbes began to rein in its contributor network. In 2018, it announced that it would begin paying 100% of its writers but that it would periodically cut 10% of its network based on poor performance. This year it lowered both its upfront monthly payment to contributors and its audience based payouts. Visiting the site today makes for an unpleasant user experience, in that it has some of the most abusive ad tech in the industry. Upon landing on an article, youxe2x80x99re immediately hit with a pop down ad that covers most of the screen. Once thatxe2x80x99s done, youxe2x80x99re then forced to watch a silent auto-play video for several seconds. I guess when youxe2x80x99re paying your writers based on traffic, you need to eek out every ounce of revenue possible for each unique view.To be clear, Ixe2x80x99m not declaring Forbesxe2x80x99s contributor model a complete failure; it expanded its audience and paid its writers, after all. It reached profitability, which is more than can be said about many legacy publishers. But I think a lot of media executives look at the Forbes brand today and arenxe2x80x99t in a hurry to emulate its platisher strategy. How Medium improved on the platisher modelWhich brings me to Medium. I wonxe2x80x99t bore you by recounting how its platform evolved since its founding, but will instead just focus on it as it is today. According to recent figures released by CEO Ev Williams, millions of logged in users visit Medium each month and several hundred thousand of them pay $5 a month to access xe2x80x9cpremiumxe2x80x9d content. Non-subscribers are allowed to access three premium articles a month before being hit with the paywall.Medium has hired away editors from legacy media companies, and they commission feature pieces and columns from freelance journalists, paying them agreed-upon rates. It also syndicates pieces from publications like The Atlantic and The New York Times. In that sense, Medium resembles your standard traditional publisher. But it also operates a partnership program that virtually any Medium user can opt into. Participating writers get paid based on a Spotify-like system that measures reading and engagement from paying subscribers. Youxe2x80x99re also rewarded if someone reads your piece and soon afterward converts into a paying subscriber.So how did Medium improve upon the platisher model? Well, for one, it created a true platform, one that doesnxe2x80x99t require a special invite to join. More importantly, itxe2x80x99s built a social graph with real network effects. Users can follow each otherxe2x80x99s accounts and share articles to their followers. They donxe2x80x99t have to wait around and hope a Medium editor promotes their pieces to the front page. Theyxe2x80x99re rewarded for a consistent publishing schedule that will increase their content exposure over time. This allows Medium to scale in ways that Forbes and HuffPost never could.But what about the brand erosion problems faced by other platishers? Well, for one, I think it helps that Medium launched as a platform and there was no pre-existing journalism brand to tarnish. Users approach its posts with the same level of skepticism theyxe2x80x99d apply to a YouTube video or tweet. Whatxe2x80x99s more, Medium allows for the creation of publications that bestow their own imprimatur of quality on an article. When I land on Mediumxe2x80x99s tech publication OneZero, for instance, I expect a higher level of writing than I would from a random Medium user because I know a professional editor commissioned and reviewed the piece.But I think therexe2x80x99s more to it than that. Medium has installed incentives that reward higher quality content. In its early days, the platform had pursued a native advertising model, but in 2017 Ev Williams announced he was shutting down the companyxe2x80x99s ad operations and pivoting to paid subscriptions. The paid partnership program that later debuted specifically predicates payment on the amount of engagement one receives from paying members. Publishing a clickbaity article that goes viral on Facebook or Twitter will generate very little remunerative value. Writers are incentivized to create content that converts users into paying, loyal subscribers.Does that mean the system canxe2x80x99t be gamed? Of course not. And as with any major social platform, Mediumxe2x80x99s admins have to continually police content for abuse and misinformation, especially in the age of Covid. It was forced to remove a post in March, for instance, that downplayed the deadliness of the pandemic.But I do think Medium has come closer than virtually any other company in achieving the equilibrium between running both a publishing and platform operation. Itxe2x80x99s proved that a platisher model can work, and I think its strategy should be studied by any publisher that wants to incorporate more user generated content into its offerings.

You can subscribe by clicking on this handy little button:Of all the content publishing platforms out there, Substack has received a disproportionate amount of attention these last few months, mostly because high profile writers keep leaving their legacy media jobs to launch paid newsletters on it. Andrew Sullivanxe2x80x99s recent departure from New York magazine, for instance, sparked the same level of discussion on Media Twitter as Lebron Jamesxe2x80x99s 2010 announcement that he intended to take his talents to South Beach.With all eyes on Substack, itxe2x80x99s been easy to forget the other major platform thatxe2x80x99s set its sights on helping creators generate revenue from their writing: Medium. The company made a series of announcements over the past month about upcoming changes to layout, publishing tools, and discovery. Itxe2x80x99s a good time to check in and analyze what these changes mean for the direction of the platform and how itxe2x80x99s affecting writersxe2x80x99 careers.User and subscriber growthFirst, letxe2x80x99s take a look at Mediumxe2x80x99s adoption. It didnxe2x80x99t reveal any exact figures, but CEO Ev Williams dropped several hints in a series of posts. He wrote that there xe2x80x9care millions of people logged into and reading Medium on the web and in our apps.xe2x80x9d More importantly, he revealed that Medium has xe2x80x9cseveral hundred thousand [paying] members.xe2x80x9d Assuming somewhere in the neighborhood of 400,000 subscribers paying $5 a month, then it could be generating at least $24 million in revenue.What does it mean for the writers who publish content behind Mediumxe2x80x99s metered paywall and therefore get a cut of that money? Williams wrote that xe2x80x9cwe pay out over two million dollars per month to writers, editors, and publication owners.xe2x80x9d The site also publishes monthly stats on its partnership program, and its top writer made $33,000 in the month of June. So with $24 million a year in writer payouts, some creators are making some decent money on Medium. Thatxe2x80x99s larger than the editorial budgets of all but a few major national publications. Itxe2x80x99s still far south than the $1 billion a year in creator payouts just announced by Patreon (more on that further down in the newsletter), but presumably therexe2x80x99s a lot of expected growth ahead of it.LayoutThis part I wonxe2x80x99t dwell on too long, but last month Medium announced it would begin introducing different background templates so writers can switch up the color and presentation of their articles. There are some writers out there who donxe2x80x99t like the sameness and uniformity of most platforms and want more control over aesthetics. Ixe2x80x99m not one of those people -- I just want my writing presented in a way that makes it easy to read and share -- but to get an understanding  of that design mindset, check out this great piece from writer Ernie Smith on why he prefers designing his layout from scratch rather than adopting the cookie cutter layouts embraced by platforms like Substack and Medium.Content discoveryThis is the one I really want to sink my teeth into, as itxe2x80x99ll have the biggest impact on audience growth for individual Medium writers. To understand the changes, it might be helpful to look back at how discovery has evolved at Medium over the years. In its earliest days, it resembled a traditional social network. When you landed on a piece of content that you liked, you could share the content with your network and then follow the writer. It was basically Twitter, but for longform writing.As a writer who back then didnxe2x80x99t publish content as consistently as I do today, I loved it. I had my own website blog, but it was just so hard to drive traffic to my articles. With Medium, I could publish an article there and then all of my followers would see it when they visited the homepage. I had several successful pieces there and over time I built my following up into the thousands.Things began to change sometime around the time Medium started forming partnerships with established media outlets like The Awl, ThinkProgress, and Pacific Standard. It rolled out an algorithmic feed which, not coincidentally, seemed to feature a lot of the content from these partner publishers. The homepage started to resemble the YouTube homepage, in that it focused less on showing you headlines from users you followed and instead tried to predict what content you actually wanted to read. This disconnect between your followers and content exposure grew even more pronounced when Medium debuted its paid partnership program. It hired lots of curators whose job it was to find good content and promote on the homepage, and it explicitly stated that you articles wouldnxe2x80x99t be considered by the curators unless you opted into the partnership program.As a creator whoxe2x80x99d built up a following on Medium, I quickly grew disillusioned with the site. I felt like they were taking away my audience and giving it to someone else, and I gradually began shifting all my publishing to Substack. Apparently I wasnxe2x80x99t the only person who felt this way, because Williams announced that Medium was shifting back toward its social media roots:Instead of starting with an algorithmic feed of stories, the new app is xe2x80x9creoriented around following xe2x80x94 so that readers can be sure theyxe2x80x99re not missing anything from writers they love, and those writers and publications can more actively engage and grow their audience.xe2x80x9d He hinted at the reason behind this change a little further down:While you can build followers on Medium, our algorithms have played a bigger role in what gets distributed. As a result, readers have been less likely to follow writers because it doesnxe2x80x99t have a huge effect.It doesnxe2x80x99t stop there. Medium is trying to reorient engagement away from the headline. Now, when one of the people you follow uploads a new article, youxe2x80x99re simply shown their profile photo on the homepage. You need to click on the photo to then scroll through their recent content. My guess is this is similar to the experience you get when youxe2x80x99re exposed to your friendsxe2x80x99 Instagram Stories; you actually need to click on the icon to see them.As a person whoxe2x80x99s never really liked Instagram stories, I canxe2x80x99t say Ixe2x80x99m too psyched about this development. If I like an article on Medium and follow the author, Ixe2x80x99m not going to necessarily remember who that author was a few days later when I see their profile photo. Just show me the headline so I can make a quick judgement call as to whether I want to read it. I donxe2x80x99t have all day!And then finally therexe2x80x99s the new newsletter feature. The company actually announced it a few weeks ago, portraying it as a way for Medium authors to more reliably reach their audience. But people scoffed when they found out that someone signing up for your newsletter on Medium wouldnxe2x80x99t actually get you access to their email addressing, meaning you couldnxe2x80x99t take your list with you if you decided to leave Medium.Williamsxe2x80x99s post recognized this as a problem, but didnxe2x80x99t offer up a solution. xe2x80x9cWe are working on the details and will have a solution to import and export for your newsletter list soon.xe2x80x9dIf Medium builds true list portability into its newsletter product, it might be a game changer. It'll essentially allow you to leverage its network effects to build a list that you own while also providing a pretty easy way to monetize your content.There were a few other product updates sprinkled into these announcements, but I think the ones I listed above are the most consequential. So what to make of these changes? I think Medium recognizes that Substack has emerged as its chief rival, and the reason high profile writers keep choosing Substack over Medium is that it gives them more direct access to their audience. Sure, one of the downsides to Substack is that there are fewer network effects, but when you already have a large fan base (as Andrew Sullivan or Matt Taibbi does), those network effects are less important. Every modern day journalist watched as Facebook delivered huge audiences and then took them away. The fact that Medium introduced its own Facebook-like algorithmic feed is probably giving a lot of writers pause.If you want to launch a new high quality podcast, the learning curve can be steep. First therexe2x80x99s the equipment and software for actually recording it. You have to learn how to edit the audio, purchase music rights, and find a web host. And those are just the technical aspects; most non-podcasters donxe2x80x99t realize how difficult it can be to find an entertaining show format, book interesting guests, or ask engaging questions.If youxe2x80x99re a full-time content creator, youxe2x80x99ll probably have the patience to figure all this out on your own, but many executives who want to dabble in podcasts as a form of content marketing want someone to guide them through the process. Thatxe2x80x99s the gamble Angela Connor made when she opened a physical recording studio in Raleigh, North Carolina. Angelaxe2x80x99s career spans across journalism, marketing, and public relations, and recently she noticed that many of her local business clients were starting to get interested in podcasts.A serial entrepreneur, Angela made the decision to rent coworking space and build a studio from scratch. I interviewed her about how she designed her podcast consulting offerings and what it takes to launch a high quality show.To access this case study and others like it, you need to become a paying subscriber to this newsletter.

Patreon also got in on the action. Its CEO Jack Conte published a YouTube video this week revealing several new developments.First, letxe2x80x99s tackle the headline news. Patreon just took on another $90 million investment in which it was valued at $1.2 billion. More important, he revealed that Patreon creators have generated $2 billion since the platformxe2x80x99s creation, and theyxe2x80x99re now on track to generate $1 billion (!) per year. Letxe2x80x99s put that in context: Patreon is generating more for its creators than The New York Times is through digital subscriptions. That seems like a pretty amazing fact to me.The biggest thing that jumped out at me in Contexe2x80x99s video was what he said about creator discovery. A few weeks ago I penned an article about xe2x80x9cwhy Patreonxe2x80x99s business model is under threat.xe2x80x9d I pointed out that every major content platform -- from YouTube to Facebook to Twitter -- was copying its core offerings, and they all had a distinct advantage because they controlled massive content distribution.Patreon used to pride itself on being content agnostic. I remember reading an interview with one of its executives who boasted that the platform didnxe2x80x99t play favorites because creators were wary of the algorithmic feeds they already had to deal with on YouTube and elsewhere. But now the company seems to be changing its tune. In his video, Conte said:Creators say, xe2x80x9cYou make me go to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and bring my audiences to Patreon. Why donxe2x80x99t you send me patrons? When I go on to YouTube, YouTube sends me audience. Why donxe2x80x99t you send me audience?xe2x80x9dThatxe2x80x99s a problem we can fix. Imagine being able to search by topics or content. Imagine being able to explore by creators and genres. And by just being a creator, the ecosystem of Patreon is sending you patrons that know you and love your work. Wexe2x80x99re building out that functionality right now.Itxe2x80x99ll be interesting to see how Patreon tackles this problem. A lot of the content uploaded to Patreon by creators is paywalled, and so it might need to start encouraging its users to publish more free content to it so it can then expose that free content to potential fans. Either way, itxe2x80x99s clear that Patreon recognizes the major content platforms as threats to its longterm business, and itxe2x80x99s not going to stand by and allow its creators to be lured away. I have a secret Facebook group thatxe2x80x99s only promoted to subscribers of this newsletter.

When he wasnxe2x80x99t working on his book, hexe2x80x99d write articles for places like The Atlantic and New York magazine. The mixture of book advance and freelance revenue provided a reasonably stable income.Today, the economic climate for journalism is much more dire. The Covid-induced recession has led to mass layoffs and a squeeze on freelancer budgets. Some publications have closed up shop completely. But in many ways, Jessexe2x80x99s income streams are more secure than ever. Thatxe2x80x99s because he launched a paid newsletter through Substack and co-hosts a hit podcast that monetizes through Patreon. Together, these two sources generate a nice six-figure income for him.I recently interviewed Jesse about why he decided to monetize his audience directly, how he designed his paid offerings, and whether he thinks platforms like Substack and Patreon can replace the income for laid-off and underemployed journalists.To listen to the interview, subscribe to The Business of Content on your favorite podcast player. If you scroll down youxe2x80x99ll also find some transcribed highlights from the interview.iTunes/ Stitcher/ Google Play/ Overcast/ Spotify/ Google/ YouTubeThis transcript has been edited for clarity.On what motivated Jesse to launch a Substack accountJesse had a pretty stable freelance career. He had his book advance and regular contract gigs at major media outlets. So why bother with a paid newsletter? The decision came after the founders of Substack reached out to him and encouraged him to join the platform. xe2x80x9cI figured I have some free time. The freelance market does not look particularly sturdy, not because of reasons having to do with me, just because of structural reasons. So why not give it a shot? And it ended up working out for me, in part, because I arrived already having a large following.xe2x80x9dThe newsletter started out completely free. xe2x80x9cI do think one of my strengths as a writer is I can do the sort of breezy, bloggy, almost Gawkery style posts. And then I can also dig deep into a social science paper that I think is important and show lay people why it's important. If you look at the most successful Substack writers, they usually operate under a single theme or tone or style. I think Ixe2x80x99m a little bit more all over the place. As with everything else I do, I cannot point to any particular strategy or forethought. I'm sure if I'd been a bit smarter, I would have written myself a memo. I would have predicted benchmarks and saw if I reached them. I didn't do any of that. It just sort of worked out from the hard work of writing, basically.xe2x80x9dAs the freelance market continued to get shakier, Jesse began thinking of Substack as a way to diversify his revenue, and he eventually launched a paid version. Unlike most Substack writers, he now puts the bulk of his longform work behind the paywall. xe2x80x9cI try to limit the free ones, especially now that I have a solid base of subscribers, but when I do a free one, I try to make it either a big sweeping argument that latches onto the present conversation, or I often just do these book giveaways, which are a good way to draw new eyes for the newsletter. Basically, if a book looks interesting to me and I feel like I'm unlikely to have time to cover it or sometimes even read it, I'll just ask the publisher for a few copies to give away on my newsletter. And I think I'm batting a thousand on that. They're always happy to. It's so brutal getting publicity for books that they're basically always happy to do it and I'm happy to do it.xe2x80x9d***Like this article so far?

Subscribe over here:Ok, back to our scheduled programmingxe2x80xa6***Why he also launched a Patreon accountSo if he was seeing so much success with Substack, why bother with another payment platform? In the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, his journalist friend Katie Herzog got furloughed from her job, and the two decided to launch a podcast called Blocked & Reported. xe2x80x9cI think the goal was always to make money off it. We didn't really have a strategy. We decided to just launch it and see where it goes.xe2x80x9d The success was almost instantaneous. xe2x80x9cThe beginning of June was just this huge inflection point. And then maybe a month after that, I started noticing that our first day download numbers had jumped by three or four times.xe2x80x9dTheir Patreon strategy was pretty simple: you need to pay to access all their episodes. xe2x80x9cRight now we're doing at least three paid episodes a month for our lowest tier. We always do one free weekly one on Monday morning. For those who pay $10 a month, every two months we do an ask us anything and we do a live video stream, both of which you get access to. And then for the $20 tier, the only other perk you get is we'll give you a shout out once a month, if you want one.xe2x80x9d How this success affected his freelance careerJesse is now generating a six figure income between Patreon and Substack. I asked him how this impacted his work for traditional media outlets. xe2x80x9cI'm no longer going to do the quick column for a few hundred bucks. These days, even if you can get $300 for an online column, that's fairly generous. The point is there's a big segment of the freelance market that's collapsing anyway, but I basically don't have to deal with it, which is incredibly fortunate. There are a lot of outlets I still like to write for, especially ones that they can support you and give you travel money for reporting and pay you well. And I feel like I can still pitch those despite whatever controversy has gone on. And I think when the book comes out, it will maybe bring more reporting opportunities. But at the end of the day, this gives me a comfortable base of income and I can just write and it's very enjoyable.xe2x80x9dDid you like this article?Do you want me to create awesome content like this for you?

You can sign up for this newsletter here:This yearxe2x80x99s Podcast Movement, an annual industry conference that attracts thousands of attendees, is currently wrapping up in Orlando. I didnxe2x80x99t go this year, but apparently the closing speaker for the conference was Guy Raz, the famed podcaster who hosts TED Radio Hour and How I Built This.There were multiple people in my stream live tweeting Razxe2x80x99s speech, and he had one line in particular that jumped out at me: \"I would take 5000 podcast listeners over 100,000 Twitter followers.xe2x80x9dThis quote really resonated with me, and I agree with it wholeheartedly. Some might read it and wonder why someone would willingly trade such a large Twitter following for an audience thatxe2x80x99s 1/20th the size. In this newsletter Ixe2x80x99m going to explain the logic behind Razxe2x80x99s assertion.Letxe2x80x99s start with a hypothetical Twitter user with 100,000 followers and compare it to a half-hour, weekly podcast with 5,000 regular listeners.By this point I hope youxe2x80x99re aware that a Twitter accountxe2x80x99s actual following is much lower than the official number of followers listed on the personxe2x80x99s profile. If you want to be extremely generous, then youxe2x80x99d estimate that maybe half of them are real followers. The other half consists of bots, brands, and users who follow thousands of other accounts, thereby guaranteeing that your tweets almost never show up in their feeds.So wexe2x80x99re already down to 50,000 true followers. But because of the speed at which tweets flow through the stream, probably only 10 percent of your followers will see any individual tweet of yours (Ixe2x80x99m basing these numbers on my own Twitter analytics and other large accounts Ixe2x80x99ve controlled on behalf of my clients).Now wexe2x80x99re down to 5,000 Twitter followers seeing any individual tweet you send out, which is the same number that listen to your hypothetical podcast.But the comparison doesnxe2x80x99t stop there. The average tweet takes no longer than 10 seconds to read. The podcast is a half hour long. So the total time your Twitter followers spend reading a single tweet of yours is 50,000 seconds, which is the equivalent of 14 hours. Seems like a lot, right?Well, the total time 5,000 podcast listeners spend listening to a single episode comes out to 2,500 hours. In other words, youxe2x80x99d have to tweet 178 times to generate the same amount of time spent consuming a single episode of your podcast. Thatxe2x80x99s 12 tweets a day over the span of two weeks.Therexe2x80x99s a reason why those within the industry claim that podcasting is one of the most intimate mediums. There are very few internet-based platforms that can generate the same amount of loyalty between a content creator and their audience.So yes. While I would never turn down the opportunity to generate 100,000 Twitter followers, Ixe2x80x99d take those 5,000 podcast listeners over them any day.Did you like that newsletter?

[link]Heads up about some changes to this newsletterSo longtime readers of this newsletter know that I publish many of my articles to Medium. I experimented with publishing some articles behind the Medium paywall, but the payouts I received werenxe2x80x99t very large, so I ended that experiment after a month and continued publishing in front of the paywall.But herexe2x80x99s the thing: because Medium is so focused on growing its paying subscriber base, it treats its non-paywalled writers like red-headed step children. So even though I have close to 10,000 followers on Medium, most of them donxe2x80x99t see my articles in their feeds when they visit the Medium homepage.Ixe2x80x99ve decided to start publishing articles directly as Substack newsletters. That means an entire article will be delivered to your inbox, but you can also just click on the headline and read a web version if youxe2x80x99d like. Why am I doing this? Because 100% of people who sign up for my Substack newsletter actually receive it. Ixe2x80x99m tired of giving away my content to platforms that then seek to siphon off my distribution as soon as itxe2x80x99s convenient for them.So anyway, this will be an ongoing experiment where I try to figure out the formatting of the newsletter.

Take LinkedIn as an example. A few years back, I started publishing articles to its publishing platform, and LinkedInxe2x80x99s editors, in order to reward me for this behavior, placed me on some kind of list that recommended me as a person that other LinkedIn users should follow. After about a year or two, Ixe2x80x99d amassed about 64,000 followers on LinkedIn. Which was awesome! My posts to LinkedIn had high visibility and I was able to generate a lot of engagement on my content.But as soon as LinkedIn giveth, LinkedIn taketh away. A few months ago, I started noticing that my posts were reaching fewer and fewer of my followers. Today, itxe2x80x99s not uncommon for a LinkedIn post to be seen by fewer than 200 people, which is a tiny fraction of my 64,000 followers. What was once a very promising distribution platform for my content now delivers very few actual readers.Why am I talking about this? Two reasons. The first: I interviewed one of the editors responsible for distributing content on LinkedIn. The second: I wrote about another platform that seems to be alienating its independent content creators: YouTube. Letxe2x80x99s jump right into it...Why LinkedIn hired the worldxe2x80x99s top business journalistsLinkedIn has an editorial staff of 60, and these editors are responsible for everything from curating user content to producing their own original reporting. [link]How YouTube is rigged against independent video creatorsMany YouTubers maintain a longstanding belief that YouTube has turned its back on its creators. Mainstream entertainment companies that produce ad-friendly, premium content are seeing the red carpet rolled out for them at the expense of independent video creators who feel theyxe2x80x99re being pushed aside.

Because it's successfully turned content into a cheap commodity. Its users just aren't loyal news readers and therefore they're not primed to pay for content.

Can here! You might have noticed Ixe2x80x99ve been a bit away from Margins. The last couple of weeks have been a bit crazy xe2x80x94 I traveled to Turkey as Northern California ceased to be livable. And right after I waited out my quarantine, I took a week off from all internet, which has been a godsend. I am still in Turkey, but we are back on schedule with Margins! Today, we talk about the Coinbase memo.Itxe2x80x99s tough to avoid the sight of Eiffel Tower in Paris, but not everyone is, or was, a fan. Famous writer Guy de Maupassant hated the Eiffel Tower so much that he'd have lunch at the base of it every day. Of all the places in Paris, he said that was the only place where he could avoid the sight of that hideous monstrosity.I thought of this when I first read the now infamous Coinbase memo. Brian Armstrong, the generally non-confrontational CEO made waves in the technorati by stating not only that Coinbase would practically eschew and discourage any political activity inside the company that doesn't relate to the company's stated mission of \"creating an open financial system.\"As an avowed believer in the futility of tech CEOs writing pointless diatribes, I found it hard not to roll my eyes when I saw it making the rounds. I think such memos serve more the writer than the intended audience, but as I also moonlight as a tech commentator right now, I took the time to read it. And hey, Brian Armstrong seemingly goes right into it:In short, I want Coinbase to be laser focused on achieving its mission, because I believe that this is the way that we can have the biggest impact on the world. We will do this by playing as a championship team, focus on building, and being transparent about what our mission is and isnxe2x80x99t.Not surprisingly, the post elicited a whole slew of reactions, especially due to its somewhat patronizing tone but also especially at this section:Political causes: We donxe2x80x99t advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission. Even if we all agree something is a problem, we may not all agree on the solution. There were people who thought it was the most honest elucidation of what most CEOs really think and also those who believed that those who believe in compartmentalized view of society would be the first to be put up against the wall when the revolution comes. All in all, though, people generally fell along party lines with fans of billionaire CEOs singing its praise, and vice versa. September 28th 2020I am not sure if a billionaire CEO makes the cut when extending sympathies in this holy year of 2020, but I gave it a try. On the one hand, as Armstrong says, facing so many difficult events both in the US and internationally, facing an increasingly activist employee base could be challenging. It's not like, as he doesn't quite say but obviously implies, he is paying all those people to go around and be political activists with cushy tech salaries.Yet, dig a bit deeper, and it's easy to see why so many people, not so surprisingly on the progressive side, were so bothered not just the content but also the tone of this new manifesto.Firstly, there are the irredeemable ironies. Political apathy is not a neutral stance, but a strongly conservative one, almost by definition. When there are competing forces, one trying to pull you in direction and another forcing you to stay where you are, saying that you'd rather not move is picking a side, not removing yourself from the equation. This is hardly a thought experiment. Here in the United States, not a single day goes by without someone pointing out how the meager turnout is one of the biggest reasons why election results are way more conservative than the entire electorate. In many other countries, like my homeland of Turkey, there are whole generations who have been actively de-politicized to let the conservative, right-wing take hold. And there's the other irony of making such a politicized statement that your company grinds to a halt discussing nothing but, as you guessed it, politics. There've been many reports of Coinbase employees going on endless debates on Slack, trying to figure out what all this means. My friends who are there now confirm those reports. Good job, Coinbase?And that brings me to my second, slightly more personal point. It's one thing to say, with some delusion but undoubtedly good intentions, that you are not a political entity. Still, it's a whole another thing to do it in such a tone to imply that any political discussion is not welcome at your company. People often say that you should never discuss sex, politics, or religion at work, yet I have never been at a workplace where adults discuss anything but. And, you know what, things often work out fine. I find it utterly infantilizing to assume that you can bring together a bunch of smart people to work on whatever but that those people can't perform their duties without letting their politics get in the way so that you tell them that there are no more politics allowed. I don't know Brian Armstrong personally, and what little I've heard of him, he seems like a good, if not slightly eccentric and nerdy fellow. Still, this decree feels less like telling people to focus on the company mission, but more of abdication of his duties as a leader. In contrast, I am reminded of how right after the 2016 elections, our director at Uber told us that while he was extremely disappointed at the outcome, he expected us to treat each other with respect. Soon after, I had discovered a couple of coworkers had voted for Trump. While I was understandably upset, I took our relationship as coworkers who spent many waking hours together, as the common ground to discuss otherwise heated topics. That is not too much ask.And lastly, the supposed company mission of creating an open financial system. I am admittedly still a crypto-skeptic, but I am approaching my own skepticism with a heavy dose of doubt at this point, given the obscene amount of money flowing into it. I still don't get how most crypto applications aren't merely worse implementations of append-only databases or content-addressable storage systems. Still, I am tapering those understanding that sometimes you just need a shock to the system to uncover new ideas, and maybe crypto is that shock. Yet, it's hard for me to square the lofty goals of \"creating an open financial system\" with the actual business of Coinbase, which is mostly letting people in the developed world speculate on assets that they don't understand, have no basis in reality, and do nothing but burn electricity. Suppose I am entirely wrong, and Coinbase is actually about creating an open financial system for the world. In that case, it's almost farcical to argue that the company that's now sitting at the center of this new system would not be involved in practically every single political decision in the world. This is the same as arguing that Wikileaks is not political because all they do is publish leaks, or that any news organization can or should be genuinely neutral. Itxe2x80x99s laughable. It goes without saying the main political ideology behind most things crypto is libertarianism and this memo barely hides its authorxe2x80x99s leanings. While I donxe2x80x99t generally have favorable opinions of libertarianism, I do respect their proponentsxe2x80x99 staunch desire to be wrong at every turn about how humans operate in the real world. What I canxe2x80x99t really handle, however, is veiling onexe2x80x99s own political goals of rebuilding the entire world order, regardless of its plausibility or feasibility and then pretending therexe2x80x99s nothing political about it. How could one, with a straight face, make the case that the world would not be made in Coinbasexe2x80x99s founderxe2x80x99s political image if they are successful at throwing it all out and rebuilding it? [1]I've talked about before how one of the unique and valuable things about America and the Western world in general is the sense of quiet it provides. There's nothing nice and inviting about having to worry about what is happening in the news that day, being glued to the TV (or Twitter, I guess) every waking day. I used to tell my friends in Turkey one of the things that seem to make America more productive is that you do not have this constant drivel of news that sucks out all the oxygen. So, I am not saying that Brian Armstrong is wrong in being worried about his company's employees being distracted with the news, or that his company dragged into politics.What I fundamentally disagree with him is the notion that you can separate the business from politics. Whether he likes it or not, any company that employs people, which is still all companies, will be involved in politics. As companies operate through people, they will be forced to take stances in what those people may or may not believe in. It might not always make everyone in the company happy, and that doesn't mean you have to respond to every news cycle by blasting out a press release, but there's no way people to turn off what is important to them as they step into the office, or sign into Slack. Again, as I mentioned before, I often think such lofty memos are more for its author to feel good about themselves than they are about charting a new course for the company. Itxe2x80x99s hard for me to imagine a workplace where there are no discussions of politics, let alone in one that is founded entirely as a political act. I am glad, in that sense, Coinbase is doing the right by allowing people who would rather not be part of it by providing them with generous exit packages. But I am also suspicious that such a policy can survive in its intended pure form. With exceptions carved out over time, itxe2x80x99ll be nothing but just another memo, written by another slightly bored tech CEO. But hey, thatxe2x80x99s what Ixe2x80x99m here for.1: The other thing is, as far as I know, Coinbase has long decided not really to throw out the the financial system but instead be part of it while making hand over fist letting people speculate crypto assets. This change of heart is one of the reasons why the company had a few high profile hires leave relatively quickly.

Today Ixe2x80x99m writing about how the TikTok deal, the infamous Trump jobs number tweet of June 2018, and the general shattering of business norms taking place.In May 2019, in one of the earliest Margins' posts I wrote the following about TikTokxe2x80x99s Chinese ownership:I still can't believe its not a bigger story that a Chinese-owned app is quietly taking over the American market. Think about all the times American tech firms have stepped over themselves to try to access the Chinese market (my favorite is imagining Xi Jinping's reaction when Zuck asked him to help give his kid a Chinese name).My fascination with the app was not one of watching people do karaoke. It was having built my own personalized news startup and always having wondered about Bytedance, the TikTok parent. I include this not to take some kind of victory lap for being early to the story (well, fine, maybe a tiny bit), but more to remind readers that the US-China tech conflict is something I have long been fascinated by.Watching this TikTok \"deal\" has been excruciating, yet so familiar. I'm going to touch on it, but first I want to go back even earlier, to June 2018.Most of the guys (yes, they were almost exclusively guys) I used to work with, in trading, were Republican. They were that very Northeastern \"keep my taxes low, I don't really care if you're gay, and most likely my family has been Republican for a few generations\". I grew up in the intensely liberal town of Lexington, Massachusetts, and until I went to college I had never met someone genuinely conservative. Sure I'd met plenty of self-identified Republicans, but never an across the board social-to-economic-to-hating-the-Clintons-with-a-passion conservative. That was until I got to college in Atlanta, GA, where experiences good enough to grace the pages of a college pamphlet abounded. One of my hallmates, who I ended up being really good friends with, told me I would be going to hell as a nonbeliever. It was a motley crew of political and social upbringings (though not hugely economic ones) and reminded me how much my childhood influenced my political leanings.When I got to work in NYC finance, I was in a much better place to handle just how antithetical to my politics the prevailing views were. It was fine, and Ixe2x80x99d even argue a productive thing. While a large part of my experience in life was defined by being an ethnic minority, being an ideological one was also formative. One thing, left or right, we all universally held was an almost religious reverence for the monthly Nonfarm Payrolls number.On the first Friday of every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the number of jobs added (or lost) in the past month. I'd guess most Margins readers are familiar with the metric, at least in passing. The minutes after the number's release were the most uniformly volatile of the month. Normally you might have one asset class see a bit of craziness. It was rare everything would get wild at a predetermined time.At 8:29 am everything would be dead silent. At 8:30:01 every Bloomberg Terminal and CNBC screen would be lit up with the month's release. The floor would erupt with yelling and fists pounding desks (or sometimes, screens). It was honestly fun and probably the thing I miss most about trading floor culture (other than the wasabi-eating contests).In June 2018 this happened. At 7:21 am Trump tweeted:June 1st 2018I vividly remember it. There were plenty of FinTwit-y people speculating whether that meant the number would be a good one. That he couldnxe2x80x99t possibly have tweeted that to give away the number. It was a tradition, one of the most sacred norms of the financial markets.But of course, it was a good number. Of course, he broke the protocol. It hasnxe2x80x99t happened since. I still wonder whether that was the one time Kudlow raised his voice. I've now spent well over a decade arguing with a few of my friends from trading life over politics. We almost got kicked out of a restaurant for arguing loudly during the Iraq War. When I did a lot of campaigning for Obama they'd harass me endlessly. But Trump was different. For them, it was more of the \"he's an idiot, but Hillary is the devil\" attitude. That jobs tweet, though, that was the moment I was beseeching them that this was something different. Something that they cared about was now forever broken. It might sound like this niche cultural thing, but like so many others, it mattered.Watching this TikTok deal unfold has felt like the drawn-out version of that jobs tweet. I really care about the business climate. I genuinely care about financial markets and technology. I am telling you this, not as some b.s. boilerplate text from the Business Roundtable about an acronym like CSR or ESG. I mean it as someone who, having had the privilege of growing up in the US while spending plenty of time in 1980s/1990s India, and seeing how a healthy climate of business built on efficiency, law, and trust can transform your overall quality of life and even your physical health.This deal reflects the absolute worst of grifter capitalism. It's so grifty I hesitate to call it a capitalistic transaction.First, at the time of writing, I honestly have no clue what is going on. I will assume most Margins readers have followed this story to some extent, but what I understand as some highlights:It's basically a cloud contract to help supercharge Oracle's cloud business.China still is saying the deal is nowhere near done.Americans might or might not own a majority of TikTok.The magical algorithm will, unquestionably, remain in China.There's something about a $5 billion tax payment to a 1776 fund, or something (fun fact: the town I grew up in is where the first battle of the American Revolution took place on April 19th, 1775).Trump needs to xe2x80x9capprovexe2x80x9d the deal for some reason.Larry Ellison and Safra Catz are big Trump donors.Those are all the \"facts\" as I understand them, but I canxe2x80x99t even state them definitively because no one really knows what is happening. This Reuters piece is the best play-by-play of the deal to date and I highly recommend you read it, just to remind yourself of the sheer absurdity of this. This is not how business should be done.The whole thing is an absolute mess, rife with conflicts of interest, demagogic personalities, nationalism, and grift. It's also one where we simply end up back at the status quo. A lot of people announce and tweet a lot of things, but nothing really happens, other then the rule of law and business predictability end up in tatters. The oddest part of trying to process this is I began this piece reminding readers....I was genuinely worried about TikTok's Chinese roots a year ago. I have been for years! I think there have been very valid concerns about it on the grounds of national security (that could be an entirely different post).But not like this. September 20th 2020I still cannot understand how any business-loving American can support this type of behavior. Left, right, up, or down. My co-host Can wrote how Facebook has become a PR company, and this reminded me how, in an era of rampant corruption, every company effectively becomes a lobbying firm. Your D.C. office becomes more important than your R&D center. At this point, we all kind of know about Zuck and Trump. I still find it a bitxe2x80xa6oddxe2x80xa6.that Trump zeroed in on TikTok so suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere. Maybe he read my Margins post from last year? But otherwise, he never even mentioned the app until after there were dinners with Zuck and the app became the most recent existential threat to the Facebook empire. But that is thinking that leans conspiratorial and instinctual rather than factual. Maybe Casey Newton's new Platformer thing will one day give us a more definitive answer.But the Oracle thing is so painful because there is no conspiracy to be conjured. It's all right out there in the open. Their entry was so nonsensical and business-comical that we don't need to stretch our imagination to come up with an explanation. Ellison strongly supported Trump so he was given the prize. A prize that was acquired in a manner worthy of an emerging market dictatorship. It would almost be more kosher if Oracle just paid out in full for TikTok and got stuck running it. But the attempted structure is even worse. Instead, they get a sweetheart investment and a supercharging of their nascent cloud business. One that without this deal, would most likely fall to the other giants who are years ahead of them. I brought up that jobs tweet story because we are just seeing more and more norms smashed. The cut-my-taxes-and-leave-me-alone segment of Americans should be terrified. They need to be terrified. This WSJ editorial titled, Trump, TikTok and Crony Capitalism, was almost comical in its lack of self-awareness:Economic statists may cheer all this, but it sure looks to all the world like U.S. government meddling that rewarded political allies. Cfius was established to protect national security, not to be used as leverage to steer investment to certain companies. Better to ban TikTok outright than negotiate a deal that the French would be proud of.Trying to take a jab at \"the French\" at the end feels like some last gasp at taking us back to the pre-Trump days. This version of TikTok capitalism is what the WSJ editorial board has been pushing for the past four years. This is the endgame they have allowed, enabled, and generally celebrated as they have sat back and watched the stock market fly. This isnxe2x80x99t French. This is the new American, brought to you by the editorial pages of the WSJ. To write \"first they came for the jobs number, then they came for tech M&A....\", given the endless array of atrocious things happening to people on a daily basis, is not the most sensitive thing to write. But, for my little corner of the world, these things trouble me endlessly.

I'm not an expert and don't have a strong understanding of how his rhetoric relates to the current (certainly unprecedented) situation.  Would very much benefit from your take.do you suppose this could be the beginning of a new phase in the so called \"trade war\", where American and Chinese cronies attempt to nationalize each others' overseas operations?No posts","title":"TikTok and the new American capitalism - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/tiktok-and-the-new-american-capitalism"}

Can here.The relentless assault on my respiratory system that is living in California in 2020 has taken a turn towards my visual cortex this week. I woke up to an orange tinged sky that my camera had trouble recognizing, which got darker and more orange as the day went on. And now, 2 days after The Day Sky Burned in San Francisco, I now woke up to what is truly the densest fog-cum-smoke Ixe2x80x99ve ever seen in Bay Area. I can barely see the end of my block from where Ixe2x80x99m sitting now.I am grateful to be in good health, not forced to evacuate, and have the financial means  to weather through this, but it does make one wonder.

Stayxe2x80xa6indoors? Outdoors?

I truly miss it every day, and maybe even more so now. The Little Red Dot is a fan-favorite among the technorati class. Itxe2x80x99s time to build, like Singapore, people say often. And of course, the indubitable father of Singapore, the man with the iron in him, Lee Kuan Yew is revered like a god too. The Great Man Theory of leadership is always a questionable one, and this amazingly written piece makes a similar case. You owe yourselves to read this.But the rise of Singapore provides compelling lessons of a different sort, ones which help us understand how the city-state was built in its unique conditions. Today, the new U.S.-China rivalry is playing out in the divergence between different development pathsxe2x80x94a divergence which may end the mythos of a universally applicable model. While Leexe2x80x99s admirers in the art of statecraft cannot import a Singaporean model, they can learn from the ardent pragmatism which drove him to reject the easy solutions of outsiders and build a state which defied all conventions.As an aside, I always thought this infamous speech by LKY as the perfect crystal ball. Everyone sees what they want to see.Matt Stoller, BIGIs Facebook a right-wing echo chamber that also profits off of polarization and rumors? Or is it just a mirror to our society where there are lots of evil people who do evil things? As cliche as the saying is, the truth is probably somewhere in between but itxe2x80x99s worth noting that Facebook is the way it is, because itxe2x80x99s designed to be that way. Itxe2x80x99s not a platform, where everything is teated the same, gets the same reach and distribution. The oligarch-in-charge, Zuckerberg, does press his thumb on the scale often. Then, does this means he needs to be liable?  And if that is so, then we need a different framework to understand just what these things are. In one sense, Facebook is a dominant communications platform that should be subject to public utility regulation and antitrust law. But I also think that standard product liability theories should apply. If a product causes harm to the customer that the customer did not expect, and the producer could reasonably see that it would do so, then the product is defective and the producer is liable for that harm.Tom Junod, EsquireAs I alluded up top, I started at an American boarding school the week 9/11 happened. Literally, one of my first memories is me running to the dorm, telling people to turn on the TV and then being ushered back to our rooms where we listened on the radio whether the world would come to an end soon after. The Twin Towers were both so far away xe2x80x94 I hadnxe2x80x99t even been in the US at the timexe2x80x94 but also so close. Maybe more so than what some Americans experienced it. But aside the whole geopolitical aspect, the towers were where real people, actual living beings worked, feared death by fire and then decided to take the matters into their own hands. This is a harrowing, but also a very human and powerful read. Itxe2x80x99s one of those pieces of writing that I go back again and again. [xe2x80xa6] All over the world, people saw the human stream debouch from the top of the North Tower, but here in the United States, we saw these images only until the networks decided not to allow such a harrowing view, out of respect for the families of those so publicly dying. At CNN, the footage was shown live, before people working in the newsroom knew what was happening; then, after what Walter Isaacson, who was then chairman of the network's news bureau, calls \"agonized discussions\" with the \"standards guy,\" it was shown only if people in it were blurred and unidentifiable; then it was not shown at all.Emily Monaco, BBCI always found it easy to connect with French people. In them, I found a mutual love of complaining. Look, as someone who grew up in a troubled land, I appreciate the optimism of America, but it can be a little nauseating at times. Life sucks sometimes. Americans find the silver lining in a catastrophe, and thatxe2x80x99s just not cool, man. But really, when French people (and I) complain, it is less about being unhappy or sad, but more about acknowledging the existential dread we all toil away in. Itxe2x80x99s more meaningful than talking about the weather (ugh!), if nothing else.In France, a complaint is an appropriate xe2x80x93 and frequent xe2x80x93 conversation starter. One could begin talking about a restaurant by focusing on the poor service during an otherwise great meal, or highlight the fact that the east-facing windows in your new flat mean you now have to buy curtains. But while, as Julie Barlow, Canadian journalist and co-author of The Bonjour Effect, explained, xe2x80x9cTo Americans, saying something negative sounds like youxe2x80x99re closing the conversationxe2x80x9d, in France, such comments are perceived as xe2x80x9ca way to invite other peoplexe2x80x99s opinionsxe2x80x9d. North Americans, she said, are not as comfortable with confrontation xe2x80x93 or with criticism xe2x80x93 as the French are.

This week I am going to try to explain a Gamma meltup to the non-finance folks while digging into what happened to the markets this summer.Masayoshi Son, at one time considered to be the Warren Buffett of Japan, has pretty much gone full Robinhood trader. - BloombergIn that Doordash piece, I mentioned how I get Softbank-triggered whenever I watched a Vision-Fundxe2x80x99ed company \"raise a ton of money, lose a ton of money, and just obliterate the basic economics of an industry.\" I've also wrote how I get Robinhood-triggered when I watch newbies dive into options trading and distort markets while endangering their bank accounts. In my most recent post, I wondered what the hell was driving the insane summer moves in the stock market.Never, in a million years, could I have imagined that all three of those posts would come together in some magical end of summer confluence. That summer rally. That 26% Salesforce ($CRM) move. That 45% Zoom ($ZM) move. Those Apple and Tesla split rallies. One of the reasons Ixe2x80x99ve effectively been ignoring markets is that it was so obvious there was something very artificial about what was happening. Especially having worked in emerging markets trading, where markets are illiquid and specific trading flows can move markets, you can feel when things are being driven by xe2x80x9ctradingxe2x80x9d and not xe2x80x9cinvestingxe2x80x9d. There was plenty of speculation over whether Robinhood and retail traders were pushing the market. But never, ever, in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that my favorite spoil Softbank had themselves gone full Robinhood! Never could I have imagined that the same people that made pizza delivery weird were making the S&P 500 weird. 2020, just stop it. This is getting too ridiculous. Nothing is real. Nothing makes sense. I have reached some sort of Margins singularity. I am laughing like a crazy person at my desk.I feel like this robot (image via Insider)Okay, I'm going to try to get a hold of myself and explain what happened. Because the more I thought about it, it all makes complete, perfect sense. If this does turn out to be a final act of sorts for this mad market, the writers will have truly delivered a masterful crescendo.Let's go back to 2017. I still remember when I first learned that the head of Softbank's Vision Fund was going to be an ex-Deutsche Bank credit derivatives trader. As someone from the bank trading world, I found it a bit odd. The moment I arrived at business school, I quickly realized that trading provided very few transferable skills relevant to the business world. You donxe2x80x99t even quite learn to invest, so much as financialize things (Ixe2x80x99m not saying thatxe2x80x99s a bad thing, just different). From what I understood, Rajeev had been involved in structured financial products, which are the opposite of understanding operational capacities and market sizes.  I spoke with someone in 2018 who had pitched the Vision Fund, and he relayed what would become an almost cliched story: They were trying to raise $100 million and were asked what they would do with $500 million. When they pushed back, they were told that if they didn't take the $500mm, it would go to their closest competitor and they would be crushed. It sounded really weird to effectively threaten a founder with more money than they had a plan for, but we all came to learn this was some new kind of investing that would play out most famously, or at least, publicly, with WeWork and the whole \"you need to be crazier, Adam\" story.But you definitely started to see the Deutsche trading floor spirit of complex structured finance making its way into the way Softbank did private markets. Just go back to that famous Series H WeWork round that supposedly valued WeWork at $47 billion. The big announcement was that Softbank invested $2 billion at a $47 billion valuation, yet $1 billion of that money was going to buy shares from investors and employees at a valuation of $20 billion. At the exact same time. Like some kind of weird Schrodinger's valuation.That is the type of financial innovation that would make a bank trader proud. Which brings us back to the current state of the markets. This summer has been nuts. It was so clear that something was completely off. It just got more and more nuts. Salesforce, now a $200 billion company, had a +26% move. Yes, they are positioned well for the post-COVID economy blah blah, but those moves just donxe2x80x99t happen at that size. Zoom, after a solid earnings report, was up freaking 40%. Again, Zoom is a great company and the future blah blah blah, but a +40% intraday for a company of that size mustxe2x80x99ve been turning analysts armed with only DCF models into crazy people hurling feces from the corner of a room.    And then, Zerohedge first, then the FT and the WSJ, reported that, yes, Softbank was at work. They were buying up call options.I had read that Softbank had started investing in all the trendy public tech companies. It brought a smile to my face; that after all the unicorn charts and 300-year plans...they just were mimicking every single other investor. But a few billion dollars spread across the stocks of a bunch of trillion-dollar firms could not be what was really tweaking the markets. But $4 billion poured into relatively illiquid options markets could. This week we learned what Masa and the Deutsche crew were up to, and if the Schrodinger's WeWork valuation was the appetizer, this is really the main course.Okay, I'm going to try to explain to you the concept of a Gamma meltup. It might be a bit ambitious to explain all of this in a newsletter, but these are all genuinely straightforward concepts and anyone with any investments should at least try to understand whatxe2x80x99s at work.Let's say my co-host Can and me have taken Margins public (maybe via a reverse merger with the Mergence Corp to get the ticker $MRGN). $MRGN stock is now worth $10, because this free newsletter is such a great business.Robin H. the investor thinks MRGN will go up a lot and very soon. But instead of buying the stock itself, she buys a call option - which is the right to buy the stock at a given price on a set date. Robin buys call with a strike price of 20 that expires on October 16th, 2020 for $1.If on October 16th MRGN is trading at $30, that contract/option is now worth $10 and happy days, Robin H. has made $9.Where things get interesting is Robin had to buy that option from someone. Enter the market maker who we'll call Ditacel. When the market-maker 'writes' the option and sells it to Robin they make $1 upfront. They now have the obligation to sell MRGN to Robin at 20 on Oct 16th.  But if our MRGN stock goes up to $30 when that option expires, they have now effectively lost $9. If free newsletters get even hotter and MRGN is at $100, Ditacel after taking $1 upfront to sell that option to Robin, has lost $80.Again, Robin has the right to buy at a certain price while Ditacel has the obligation to sell at that price. The most important dynamic to understand is the people selling the call options have theoretically infinite losses.The sellers of options need to hedge or cancel out all that risk. You can buy the underlying stock - that way if the stock runs up, you would lose money on the option you sold but make money on the stock you now own. You can buy a similar call option from some other market-marker. Both of these hedging actions would exert some kind of upward pressure on both the stock and the call option price.This act of hedging your risk from selling options is known as managing your Gamma. According to Goldman back in June, \"Gamma has the potential to be one of the most important non-fundamental flows in equity markets\". It's exactly that - a flow of money that has nothing to do with the fundamentals of companies or economies but is simply a weird momentum byproduct of options trading.In a normal market, this risk-hedging wouldn't have any real impact on the price of the stock itself. The amount of options being traded would be tiny relative to the amount of actual stock being traded. All this stuff would be taking place via transactions triggered in the background by automated risk systems and we would instead be analyzing earnings reports to assign long-term valuations.There had, however, been talk of a secret \"Nasdaq whale\" that was buying up billions of dollars in call options, and this week we found out it was motherfucking Masa, man!Now it has also made a splash in trading derivatives linked to some of those new investments, which has shocked market veterans. xe2x80x9cThese are some of the biggest trades Ixe2x80x99ve seen in 20 years of doing this,xe2x80x9d said one derivatives-focused US hedge fund manager. xe2x80x9cThe flow is huge.\"and we also need to factor in that normally during the summer, trading volumes are lighter, making any big trade have even more of an impact:The size and aggressiveness of the mysterious call buyer, coupled with the summer trading lull, has been a big factor in the buoyant performance of many big tech names as well as the broader US stock market, according to Mr McElligott. This week, he warned that dynamics around options meant the heavy purchases forced banks on the other side of the trades to hedge themselves by buying stocks, in a xe2x80x9cclassic xe2x80x98tail wags the dogxe2x80x99 feedback loopxe2x80x9d.Try to understand the self-reinforcing aspects of a strategy like as follows:SoftBank buys far more call options than the market is used to handling. The market-makers have now sold far more call options than they're used to and need to hedge, meaning they're going to be buying that underlying stock. That pushes the price up, meaning they will need to buy even more of that stock to hedge. And let's not forget the COVID + software will eat the world stories, which are very true. Does anyone want to bet against Apple or Tesla or Amazon or Zoom or Shopify? What other stock are you going to buy?This explains how a giant company like Zoom goes up 40% in just one day. There's natural buying pressure from people excited about those amazing earnings, but these distorted market dynamics create a buying frenzy as the market-makers who are exposed to these run-ups have to buy more and more of the stock to keep their exposure down. They buy more stock to hedge which triggers algorithms somewhere else to buy more of that stock. Regular humans who just want to buy stocks get alerts about an amazing stock and also buy that stock. Which makes the market-maker who originally sold the option need to buy even more stock to hedge. That's the Gamma Melt-up.September 6th 2020A good thread that outlines some numbers behind a potential Gamma melt-upSuddenly Softbank is showing profits of $4 billion in just two months on an initial investment of $4 billion (a 6300% IRR?)!To anyone from outside of finance, it must sound ridiculous that this is how the very capital markets that handle your retirement money function, and as I write it, it kind of is. But again, if there's one thing to take away, it's that there can be these quirky, short-term feedback loops (reflexivity in real-time!) that completely distort prices in a market. And if there's one thing I always would've imagined the Softbank investment team was genuinely qualified to do, it's this kind of stuff. Investing in data-driven dog-walking apps always felt a bit out of their wheelhouse. Exploiting the short-term dynamics of a somewhat illiquid, fast-moving and gigantic market? Thatxe2x80x99s the stuff Deutsche traders crave for. Rajeev Misra oversaw the Deutsche traders who made the bet against U.S. subprime and were even featured in The Big Short. Meanwhile, the new head of the Softbank public markets fund behind all of this was formerly a prop trader at Deutsche.Maybe the world is finally making more sense to me.It's not just Softbank either. There's plenty of debate over whether the options activity of retail traders as a whole has been affecting the market. Whoever is \"to blame\" the Robinhood-ification of the stock market as a whole has already taken place:Goldman had observed a \"historic inversion\" in the stock market: for the first time ever, the average daily value of options traded has exceeded shares, with July single stock options volumes hitting 114% of shares volumes.September 5th 2020In most matters of capital, there is always some element of a game. But there is also that whole capitalism thing where capital is smartly allocated to create businesses. When Softbank is involved, it feels like the entire thing becomes the game. It's all financial engineering, and of course it is! That's who was always running the show!Hopefully, the above explanation made some sense, especially for the non-finance folks. The gamification of the public equity market has been fun for me to watch and has certainly made a lot of people who have actually managed to sell a lot of money. But, while it's boring, it's worth remembering that capital markets are supposed to be about allocating capital. And there are real consequences to this run-up. And when we have record highs in the stock market like this, things happen, like we collectively lose the will to push through an extension to the stimulus.....Note 1: This self-reinforcing Gamma melt-up is not a secret. r/WallStreetBets was supposedly coordinating similar strategies on small-cap stocks. I know this post is already really long, but I wanted to paste this entire section from Matt Levinexe2x80x99s newsletter because it's from all the way back in February, yet reads so perfectly when switching out r/WSB with Softbank:Another big part of the r/WSB story is about, uh, manipulation? I do not want to give you legal advice, but as a general matter, for entertainment purposes only, I will say:If you like a stock, and buy it, and go post on Reddit xe2x80x9cI like this stock and bought it and here is why,xe2x80x9d and other people are persuaded by your reasoning and buy it too, pushing the stock price up, then good for you, smart trade.If you like a stock, and buy it, and go post on Reddit xe2x80x9cwouldnxe2x80x99t it be funny if we all buy this stock to push the price higher and then offload it to unsuspecting n00bs who are attracted by the price action,xe2x80x9d and your Reddit buddies are persuaded and you all go and do that, then that might be market manipulation.If you buy a stock and go post a bunch of lies on Reddit about how great the company is and how it has discovered a cure for cancer that will be announced imminently, and other people read your lies and are persuaded and buy the stock while you sell it, then that might be securities fraud.And one natural result of r/WSBxe2x80x99s effect on the market, and of the attention it gets from the media (sorry!), is that more posts on the forum will tend to be in categories 2 and 3, because now those categories can work. You need an audience for manipulation, and now you can get one. Byrne Hobart notes that an audience for manipulation might attract professional manipulators; xe2x80x9cin equities, the scalable professionals are either a) people who work in the industry and are constrained in how much they can tout, and b) criminals.xe2x80x9dNote 2: These kinds of self-reinforcing strategies have always been present in smaller, more illiquid markets. The gamesmanship in the Trading Places attempt at cornering the orange juice market is still one of my favorite movie scenes of all time. Sell Mortimer!Note 3: While all the main financial publications are doing great reporting on this story, ZeroHedge really has been a must-read. When it comes to financial skullduggery and complex market dynamics, and especially anything Deutsche related, they're still a go-to.Note 4: I have never written/sold options and only understand the concept of Gamma hedging at a theoretical level. Ixe2x80x99m sure there will be some who read this and think xe2x80x9cthis guy has no cluexe2x80x9d. This was a good thread from someone who insists that Softbank hasnxe2x80x99t really had an effect:September 6th 2020Note 5: Where do we go from here? While these newsletters by no means constitute investment advice xf0x9fx98x80 (seriously, remember my rule: \"a general rule is anytime anyone tells you about an investment, you shouldn't listen.\") I will say that I have been flummoxed and frustrated at how little sense the markets were making to me.

Ixe2x80x99m currently in Nahant, Massachusetts - a tiny island that feels like Cape Cod but is not too far from Downtown Boston. The local fish market has a giant lobster tank where theyxe2x80x99re on special for $5 a pound. Boiled. Steamed. Poached. Baked. Grilled. Newburg. Thermidor. Itxe2x80x99s all happening this week. For my half of the links, I will warn you itxe2x80x99s a bit lobster heavy. I learned today that my co-host Can is allergic to shellfish and hasnxe2x80x99t had lobster in years, so he will take you in a different direction.

I vividly remember reading around the time it was first published in 2004. As someone who grew up in the Boston area and was around plenty of lobster - even in an Indian family, it kind of felt like part of the assimilation process - I had never really xe2x80x9cthoughtxe2x80x9d about lobsters. It was the first time I learned that lobster was considered low-class food through the 1800s, but more importantly, the first time I actually thought about the act of boiling a lobster (spoiler: Ixe2x80x99m still okay with it).Itxe2x80x99s a slow build; calling it like water coming to a slow boil would be a bit clichxc3xa9, but that is kind of what it is. It reminds us of the power of an essay thatxe2x80x99s a bit narrative, a bit rambling, a bit thought-provoking, doesnxe2x80x99t quite end up anywhere too firm, but leaves you with a lot of questions. If wexe2x80x99re doing our Marginsxe2x80x99 job right, hopefully the experience is sometimes similar.Me on Medium from 2013 - 3 min readIf you were offered a 1.5 lobster in Chinatown from an outdoor fish market for $5.72, would you eat it?This was one of the earliest pieces I wrote using the Medium platform. Clearly lobster prices have long been on my mind for a while. I think as a New Englander who is obsessed with the economics of food, itxe2x80x99s a natural fit.There was a good deal of talk this summer about lobster prices. While the price in Maine fell to $2.20 a pound, New York City lobster rolls barely budged from their $15 average. One theory on this market inefficiency is restaurants need the price of lobster high to make fish dishes look relatively cheaper. If they drop the lobster prices, the whole charade crumbles. Another more innocent explanation is theyxe2x80x99re simply hedging for when prices rise again.There is however one place in New York City where the invisible hand still reigns supreme: Chinatown.Gastropod (Podcast) - 40 minute listenWe listened to this on the drive up to Boston. There is an amazing section featuring the author of a book: The Secret Life of Lobsters - How Fishermen and Scientists Are Unraveling the Mysteries of Our Favorite Crustacean covering how lobsters effectively urinate from their faces to communicate with one another. Therexe2x80x99s also a really fascinating section on how lobster shells are both incredibly strong and flexible, and is now being experimentally repurposed into packaging, and even armor.New Atlas - 2 min readLobster innovation xf0x9fx94xa5.YouTube - 3 min watchMy final goal for the week.

As many of our readers know, Ixe2x80x99m from Turkey and the Turkish government has been, letxe2x80x99s say, quite creative in using Twitter, both as a tool to disseminate its message and crowd out the dissenting commentary, but also as a company as a whole to hunt out its critics. There are always rumors in the Turkish diaspora that there are mules working at Twitter, both pro-and-against the government. I never got to the bottom of it, but suspected therexe2x80x99s some truth to it. The Saudi family seems a bit more, errr, aggressive in their attempts? Maybe not so surprising coming from a regime that chops its critics to pieces.Then came the ask. Twitter users were making trouble for Mohammed, including one nicknamed Mujtahidd, who had been brazenly criticizing the royal family and publishing rumors about senior members that often had a kernel of truth. It was a political mess, but it wasnxe2x80x99t criminal or terrorist in nature, so Twitter wouldnxe2x80x99t reveal the identity of such users to Saudi law enforcement. Asaker asked if Abouammo could help them find information on the people who registered these accounts.New Yorker - 14 min readI am not a US citizen (yet?) so the whole election brouhaha is not really relevant. I mean, it is relevant that I do live in the US and am deeply impacted by who gets to rule the federal government (in fact, more so than most American since as an immigrant, I deal with the federal government more than most of you) but itxe2x80x99s still a bit more academic than pragmatic. As Turkey is obviously in Europe and hence Ixe2x80x99m obviously European, itxe2x80x99s a bit of a stretch for me to call when people call Biden a xe2x80x9cleftyxe2x80x9d figure but hexe2x80x99s center through and through. Ixe2x80x99ll take it.When Obama asked Biden to join the ticket, some Democrats were baffled. Biden, running as a candidate in that yearxe2x80x99s primaries, had failed to crack one per cent in the Iowa caucuses. But Obama admired his feisty debate performance, his knowledge of foreign leaders, and his connections in D.C. Biden was also, as Axelrod put it to me, xe2x80x9cculturally and geographically well situatedxe2x80x9d: he made Obama more attractive to older working-class Midwestern whites, who might not feel a natural connection to a Black former community organizer. Beneath the raw electoral calculation, Biden and Obama shared a basic belief that Americans craved unity in politics. Running for President, Obama called attention to fraying social bonds. He told an audience in 2008, xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m talking about an empathy deficit, the inability to recognize ourselves in one another, to understand that we are our brotherxe2x80x99s keeper and our sisterxe2x80x99s keeperxe2x80x94and, in the words of Dr. King, we are all tied together in a xe2x80x98single garment of destiny.xe2x80x99 xe2x80x9dNY Times - 5 min readPeople say things like xe2x80x9cinternet is not real lifexe2x80x9d often, and this becomes more specific among the Twitter-addicted pundit/media class by replacing the internet by Twitter. Itxe2x80x99s worth remembering though that while Trump is the Twitter president, Facebook is almost 10 times bigger than Twitter (by really any metric you choose) and what happens on Facebook often goes unnoticed among the media types. And as Kevin Roose shows over and over again, what happens there is not pretty.But what sticks out, when you dig in to the data, is just how dominant the Facebook right truly is. Pro-Trump political influencers have spent years building a well-oiled media machine that swarms around every major news story, creating a torrent of viral commentary that reliably drowns out both the mainstream media and the liberal opposition.The result is a kind of parallel media universe that left-of-center Facebook users may never encounter, but that has been stunningly effective in shaping its own version of reality. Inside the right-wing Facebook bubble, President Trumpxe2x80x99s response to Covid-19 has been strong and effective, Joe Biden is barely capable of forming sentences, and Black Lives Matter is a dangerous group of violent looters.Kirby Fergusonxe2x80x99s Everything is a Remix series is one of my favorite things online and you owe it to yourselves to watch it. But this time, he comes with something both darker and relevant to our times (and our themes on Margins). I donxe2x80x99t eat shellfish so I canxe2x80x99t really contribute to this weekxe2x80x99s Lobster Discourse, but Ixe2x80x99ll do better.

Can here. Today we talk about Facebookxe2x80x99s never-ending PR nightmare.A couple weeks ago, I talked about the dual reality I seemed to be living in. In one, there's an America that's in shambles, with her back broken from unemployment and poverty and tiny virus, and another that seems to be awash in cash, with investors who are dying to pour millions of dollars to yet another tool for thought or a future of work idea.August 17th 2020I have received a couple of pieces of feedback on that piece. Obviously, having it called a miserablist diatribe was my crowning achievement. I mean, I enjoyed the not-so-subtle \"Let them eat stocks!\" vibe from telling people who are unemployed and can't put food on the table that they should be happy $SHOP is doing well, but you know, it is what it is. Haters gonna hate, and stonks willxe2x80xa6stonk? Remember: This newsletter is not financial advice. For that, you have to go to Dave Portnoy's Twitter feed (again, which also is not financial advice).Anyway, speaking of dual realities, let's dive into one of my favorite companies ever. Yep, Facebook. The answer, again, depends on where you are looking at. On the one hand, they are doing better than ever. Alongside its frenemies, Microsoft, Google (never Alphabet!!), Amazon and Apple, the blue-app company's stock is one of the precious few that are not just going up and up, but almost carrying the entire stock market on its back. Seriously, it's doing great! SO GREAT! Rocketship emoji! Fire! Yet, if you divert your gaze away from your Bloomberg terminal (or Robinhood app) for a second and look at the headlines surrounding the company, you'd think they are running with their hair on fire.  I mean, this is just an assortment of headlines about Facebook from the last couple of weeks:Facebook CEO admits 'operational mistake' in failure to remove Kenosha militia pageFacebook Executive Supported India's Modi, Disparaged Opposition in Internal MessagesFacebook Fired An Employee Who Collected Evidence Of Right-Wing Pages Getting Preferential TreatmentThat is not great!Look, at this point, it's not even worth mentioning that we owe to Facebook for Trump. People have made this point, the day after the election, Zuckerberg called it a \"pretty crazy idea\", but then even the Facebook executives had to come to terms with the reality their engagement-bolstering machine powered by (and for) ads is so powerful that it can infect millions of brains so effectively that it can hand over the nuclear codes to a reality TV-show star.August 28th 2020The other day, I saw on Twitter a leak from Facebook where the comms people were pleading to their coworkers to stop leaking to the press. The comms folks, in a weird form of irony, were so inundated with their moderation work that they had to ask people whose main task is to create more moderation work for the poorly paid and mentally traumatized people to please creating less work for them. In my view, Facebook should keep things on brand and promise to replace the comms people with AI tools to relieve them of their pain, but also keep things on even more brand and never actually do that and instead subject them to grueling work conditions!My co-host Ranjan once talked about how Facebook's PR feels broken, and I think there was a bit of truth to that, at least at that point in time. However, I personally am thoroughly amused by how good at this company is coming up with buzzwords and cute phrases and have them not just absorb the energy from the news cycle but also inject them into popular culture, let alone Silicon Valley nomenclature.The Move Fast and Break Things was the first entrant, which obviously is a too-on-the-nose and extremely tired metaphor for the company's overall impact on the world, but that soon made its way to Move Fast with Stable Infra. There was the extremely-obnoxious Building Global Community phase, which really was a sequel to Making the World More Open and Connected and also is somewhat related to A Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking. Ixe2x80x99m so tired. But then, during the great Cambridge Analytica Happening, we had the Not a Breach of Data, but Breach of Trust, a phrase actually coined by yours trulyxc2xb9.When Zuckerberg et al. started getting weary of its impact on journalism, it invented the term The Fifth Estate, and placed itself at the core of it to much critical acclaim. And more recently, the company declared itself the ever-so-righteous Not an Arbiter of Truth, so as not to hurt its oligarchic relationship, and also recently brushed over its endemic inability to moderate (as usual) as An Operational Mistake. We are done?I am unclear what the explanation for having an Islamaphobic executive in its ranks in India will be, but a Zuckian mixture of \"Lapse in Judgement\" and \"Diversity of Thought\" seems likely. Wexe2x80x99ll have to wait and see.One of the jokesxc2xb2 at Uber was that if things ever did not work out as a ridesharing app, we could just pivot to becoming a law or a consulting firm since we were so good at introducing ridesharing to many cities and finding creative ways to increase awareness and gain market share. The darker way to read the joke is that Uber is less of a tech company, but a financial entity composed to find regulatory arbitrage opportunities and suck the profits dry until it can find other sources of revenue. The joke is funny because it is true.So, in that way, I read Facebook less as a tech company, but instead a communications one. Not a telecom communications, but more like a PR / marketing consultancy. There's nothing original about Facebook. It's a company that hires people to build others' ideas, and, more often than not, it does that better and faster than them too. And when it can't do that, it just buys them outright. There is a lot of building, but the ideas are outsourced. But what Facebook is really good at is actually doing all this while fighting what seems to be a never-ending, at least since 2016 or so, PR battle while not giving an inch.With all the negative press around, you might think they are not doing a good job at avoiding criticism, but consider the alternative that they've been able to weather all this because they've been able to deflect the criticism and avoid scrutiny and accountability. I know this all sounds pretty unhinged right now, but, stay with me. This is a company who hires conservative politicians to its highest ranks in multiple countries, while maintaining a veneer of political neutrality. The same company pretends its not the arbiter of truth while employing tens of thousands of people to do exactly that. Ask yourselves: What has changed at Facebook?Of course, therexe2x80x99s another way to reconcile the constant deluge of bad PR with a skyrocketing stock price. Maybe none of it really matters. Maybe it is that while the critics might have a point here and there, things are actually fine. That seems sort of plausible: if you have billions of users, a good chunk of them will be bad people, and theyxe2x80x99ll do bad things. And, sure, obviously, Facebook also does a lot of good things for a lot of people too, like giving billions of people the ability to communicate freely, or providing marketing tools to especially small businesses all around the world. And sure, you can even have the tired, bad-faith \"The media is just mad at Facebook because Facebook (and Google) ate their lunch\" argument if you will.At some point, though, the chickens do come home to roost and the seed of truth in that joke, that Uber is a law firm in disguise, reared its ugly head. When Uberxe2x80x99s preferred method of innovation, that is business model innovation (or regulatory innovation, fine!), proved more profitable than one of technological innovation, and the firm put that into hyperdrive by valorizing a culture of aggressiveness both externally and internally, things got really ugly really fast. So much so that even the CEO could not survive the blast coming from the collapsing of the two sides of the joke into one.And, in that sense, Facebook's ability to receive this much bad press and its ability to still avoid any real accountability feel like a long running liability that will at some point come to a head. Somethingxe2x80x99s gotta give. Just like you can't merely look at a few charts on FT and say things are going better than ever in the US economy, you also can't look at Facebook's ARPU and P/E ratio and decide to stay the course while ignoring the headlines of real people suffering real damages. I get angry when people say xe2x80x9cYou are mad at Facebook because of Trumpxe2x80x9d as if thatxe2x80x99s not a good enough reason. And maybe some if it is on us. By now, we should know better than using a single metric to flatten the impact of one company, let alone thatxe2x80x99s as big and wide as Facebook. Just like no high watermark on S&P 500 will bring back the hundreds of thousands killed by Covid-19, no amount of dividends paid by $FB will bring lessen the impact of Trump, or Q, or a genocide. The reality is not a two-dimensional spectrum from light to dark; the good in one axis does not make up for the bad in another.At some point, the multi-dimensional reality will clash with the supposed two-dimensional narrative. The cute catchphrases and the sober speeches will no longer be able to act as the glue between what the company thinks it is, and what it really is. You can also wrap together so much PR ganache over what is a pile of turd. And who knows, maybe they are not even that good at that either. This, after all, is a company that once thought comparing itself to a chair was a good idea.1: As the Cambridge Analytica crisis was unfolding, I was bothered by some reporting that called it a xe2x80x9cdata breachxe2x80x9d. To me, it was clear what transpired happened with Facebooksxe2x80x99s knowledge, so it wasnxe2x80x99t a data breach, but Facebook breaching the trust of its users. A Facebook executive saw my tweet, and said he agreed and took the term to Zuck and co, who also liked it and decided to adopt it for the news cycle. And that was my contribution to The Discourse!2: The executive who made this joke deeply regretted it later, Ixe2x80x99ve been told.

I know we collectively keep saying this, but seriously, what a week! And itxe2x80x99s still going! It has been truly relentless here in the Bay Area, and itxe2x80x99s definitely taken a toll on me. Is anything ever going to get better, or should we just get used to living in hell? I kid, but only a little. I feel grateful and lucky to be up and healthy, but the entire country seems like itxe2x80x99s teetering on the edge of something. This week we have an assortment of reads for you. There are GPT-3 things, iPod things, and of course fire things. But also, on the lighter side, you can read about new media heroes, calendars, and also financial covenants!Stay safe!James YuAre you even a technologist these days if you donxe2x80x99t use GPT-3 for something? Is having access to it a flex? I donxe2x80x99t know. But,  James Yu has one of the most fascinating demos Ixe2x80x99ve seen with it so far xe2x80x94 he not only uses it to generate passages in his stories, but he also chats with it (what is the correct pronoun for an AI thatxe2x80x99s practically trained on all of the worldxe2x80x99s written content?) about the passages it has written. James has been a long time reader of Margins, and Ixe2x80x99ve always enjoyed his fiction too. You should give Singular a look, and then hop over to see more of his work. August 20th 2020Alex IrpanOK, letxe2x80x99s talk a bit more on AI. This is an interesting read from Alex Irpan, a software engineer on Googlexe2x80x99s Brain (lol, what?) team. He gives a good, slightly technical but definitely approachable overview of the main techniques used in machine learning that give rise to tools like the aforementioned GPT-3. We are approaching a point where unsupervised learning, where machines learn without much help, might yield good enough results and that is something to be both scared and excited.Enter unsupervised learning. These methods are getting better, and what xe2x80x9clabelxe2x80x9d means is shifting towards something easier to obtain. GPT-3 is trained on a bunch of web crawling data, and although some input processing was required, it didnxe2x80x99t need a human to verify every sentence of text before it went into model training. At sufficient scale, itxe2x80x99s looking like itxe2x80x99s okay for your labels to be noisy and your data to be messy.Anna Wiener, The New YorkerLiving in California, and especially in the Bay Area has been a relentless, sustained attack on our respiratory systems. First we had to Stay Home (TM), because the virus was spreading. And then, stay outdoors, because, again, the virus was spreading but apparently better indoors than outdoors. But now, we have the fires and we have to stay in again. Anna Wiener, in her dreamy prose as usual, captures the mood of living in San Francisco right now but also ties it back to what it means to be witnessing the struggles of a country that had it priorities messed up for decades and now watching it all fall apart. Itxe2x80x99s hard not to see all this in terms of a cascading series of national failures: the chaotic, politicized, fabulistic response to the virus; the political influence of oil and gas conglomerates; the fecklessness of private utility companies; cruel immigration policies and weakened labor protections; environmental rollbacks; a weakened social safety net. Some failures, like global warming, are bigger than any one countryxe2x80x99s, although the United States has failed here, too. According to meteorologists, last weekxe2x80x99s dry lightning was connected to the heat wave, which was generated by winds from Tropical Storm Fausto. Colorado is also experiencing a spate of wildfires, one of which is the second-largest in its history. These are the conditions for secondary environmental and public-health crises. Smoke from the fires in California and Colorado is uncoiling across the country. Plumes have already drifted as far as Kansas.Off the Run, Mary ChildsOK, look, I love reading  smart people explain complicated things inxe2x80xa6letxe2x80x99s say casual language. Itxe2x80x99s a tone I try to hit, but can rarely do so. Mary Childs hits it right out of the park. Filing this one under newsletter goals.lol ok I get that Brigade is doing an argument here, but I xe2x80xa6 is it more believable that Citi randomly had a fit of pity? like xe2x80x9cohhh poor hedge funds :( maybe they are right about that default, that was so mean of us/Revlon, letxe2x80x99s go ahead and, unprompted, make it rightxe2x80x9d ? That would be an exciting development in capital markets, but xe2x80xa6 Ixe2x80x99m not convinced.David Shayer, The TidbitsOne of the joys of working at a big enough firm is being called in every once in a while for projects that are very cool, but must be kept under the wraps. I am not even kidding, itxe2x80x99s just cool. You can sort of imagine from the first paragraph where this is going to go, but I couldnxe2x80x99t help smile through this entire thing. Itxe2x80x99s definitely quite a technical read, so skim over to the end for the good stuff.It was a gray day in late 2005. I was sitting at my desk, writing code for the next yearxe2x80x99s iPod. Without knocking, the director of iPod Softwarexe2x80x94my bossxe2x80x99s bossxe2x80x94abruptly entered and closed the door behind him. He cut to the chase. xe2x80x9cI have a special assignment for you. Your boss doesnxe2x80x99t know about it. Youxe2x80x99ll help two engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod. Report only to me.xe2x80x9dDavid Pierce, ProtocolHaving to manage relationships with a number of clients involves a lot of calendar management. When Calendly came on the scene (a tool I imagine a lot of Margins readers have had some exposure to) it felt like a bit of a revelation. The more people are working remotely, the more we need good calendar tools. I loved this Protocol piece that apparently started with:August 25th 2020Tools like Calendly exist entirely to make scheduling easier, turning a long chain of emails into a simple point-and-click exercise. These apps test certain unwritten rules about calendars, though. How many people should be allowed to put time on your calendar? And is it rude to send someone your Calendly link, as if to say, \"Look how few slots I have open, good luck fitting into my enormously important life?\" (Some say yes, but the growth of Calendly and others says otherwise.)Eric Feng, Media by MediumAs someone who writes a Substack newsletter and runs a consulting business advising people on content products and monetization, Ixe2x80x99m certainly paying close attention to this whole passion economy/follow-your-dreams-and-go-indie movement. This Eric Feng post laid out this strategy in a really creative way (more so for people who follow the DTC /retail worlds closely and know the famous Andy Dunn term): xe2x80x9cReturning back to the media industry, the exact same phenomenon is happening here. A new class of content creators has emerged that is writing, recording, filming, and producing incredibly unique and compelling media and then connecting directly to audiences to showcase and sell their creative products. I call them Digitally Native Vertical Creators or DNVCs. And just like their retail DNVB counterparts, DNVCs are also building off a new wave of technology platforms that have democratized access to capabilities across the entire media product lifecycle for this new breed of content creators.xe2x80x9dGeorgia Wells, Jeff Horwitz, and Aruna Viswanatha, The Wall Street JournalThe big FB news story from the WSJ this week that revealed Zuck had planted the seed of xe2x80x9cTikTok = evilxe2x80x9d last Fall is not surprising to me at all (but Ixe2x80x99m still glad is now somewhat in the public record). I had previously written how, for all the talk about AI in content moderation, the way Facebook approaches content is as human as can be. Except, rather than driven by some editorial sensibility, itxe2x80x99s driven by business strategy.At this point, how do those who still argue Facebook is simply a platform that should not be the arbiter of the truth reconcile the revealed decision after decision of the company making very editorial decisions when it benefits them? Ixe2x80x99m not being facetious here - please reply as Ixe2x80x99m genuinely curious about what our Marginsxe2x80x99 readers would think? Bradley Hope and Justin Scheck, Vanity FairI read this Vanity Fair article in Instapaper, so it was text only. As I was reading about a Saudi prince who living the life of a xe2x80x9clibertinexe2x80x9d, one detail jumped out at me: he weighed nearly 400 pounds. I forced myself to wait to do a google image search until I had finished the longish piece.With armed guards, six full-time nurses and a doctor, rotating xe2x80x9cgirlfriendsxe2x80x9d hired from a Swiss modeling agency, and an international assortment of hangers-on, Sultan spent millions of dollars a month. From Oslo to Berlin, Geneva, and Paris, the modern-day luxury caravan ate only the finest food and drank only the best wine. After a few days or weeks in a city, Sultan would order butlers to pack his bags and call the Saudi embassy for an escort to the airport. Theyxe2x80x99d hop on a rented plane and set out for the next cityxe2x80x9dFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.If Facebook is going to proactively arbitrate truth, who should be in charge of determining what is \"truth\"? The reason Zuck keeps punting on this no matter what he determines to be \"truth\", either Republicans or Democrats will criticize him for it and push for regulatory action. Zuck's inaction is him doing his best to avoid regulatory action.Sure, their algorithms will indirectly shape how we view reality but for the most part, Facebook's internal teams are focused on measurements like engagement, not truth. The News Feed almost definitely had an impact on the 2016 election but that was hardly what Chamath's growth team had in mind when they were laying down the foundations for it. The only way that Zuck would feel comfortable having an honest conversation about truth is if the politicians lay down their regulatory rifles. And we all know that isn't going to happen.No posts","title":"Links on the Margins â August 27th - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/links-on-the-margins-august-27th"}

Today Ixe2x80x99ll be laying out a few theories on how the shift to remote work might help explain why stonks keep stonking.August 18th 2020Most of you have been seeing the headlines: S&P at an all-time high! Apple is now a two-trillion dollar company!There's been ample discussion about the relation, or disconnect, between the stock market and the \"real\" economy. How can we possibly see a surge in prices while tens of millions of Americans are unemployed and a great deal of the stimulus packages are ending?My co-host Can tackled this topic of \"haves and have nots\" last week (in a post that led to someone referring to us as \"miserablists\"xe2x80xa6a moniker I will proudly own). I wanted to dig a bit more into the \"how\" I think we arrived at this confusing state of economic dissonance, and am going to try to explain why I think remote working (WFH) is playing a part in this.The first thing everyone should make sure to be familiar with is the idea of a K-shaped recovery. Back in late March/early April, there was a good deal of discussion around what a possible recovery could look like. We had letters like L, V, W, Z, and even some talked about a Nike Swoosh recovery.The first time I encountered the idea of a K-shaped recovery was back in June from Peter Atwater, a Professor at William & Mary. The idea is that rather than one collective recovery that follows some drawable path, there are two very distinct recoveries taking place. One line happily extends up and to the right, while the other concurrently declines.If you're interested in better understanding the economic data backing this up, along with a great piece on the technological underpinnings of the K, check out:Washington Post: \"Economists talking up 'K shaped' recovery as stocks surge but inequality widens\"Wall Street Journal: \"COVID-19 is dividing the American worker\" (this from Chris Mims should be required reading). But for the purpose of this article, letxe2x80x99s focus on the top half of the K. A lot of people are watching things around them improve.If you're among those doing well, most likely your cashflow is also doing very well. I write this with a bit of hesitation as I know it feels out-of-touch and obnoxious and seems to come up in conversations like a dirty little secret, but the data is clear:The U.S. personal saving rate xe2x80x94  the percentage of peoplexe2x80x99s income remaining each month after taxes and spending xe2x80x94 skyrocketed to a record 32.2% in April, up from 12.7% in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. At the same time, consumer spending fell 12.6% as the economy slowed down and unemployment rose.For me at least, there are just fewer things to spend money on. I'm still fairly millenial-y in that almost all disposable income I spend is on \"experiences\" (I hate that word). Travel, dining out, going out, activities with the kids; all of this spending just came to a complete halt while my income has not changed. Sure, I'll buy some stuff online, but otherwise, there is just more income left over to save and invest. Itxe2x80x99s not just the well-to-do. If you had managed to pull off some combination of stimulus checks, PPP loans or unemployment assistance, your bank account wouldxe2x80x99ve been very happy. When 40% of Americans can't afford a $400 emergency expense, those stimulus checks wouldxe2x80x99ve transformed bank accounts. And that was the exact plan: to unload cash upon the people! Say what you will about our government being dysfunctional, but Jerome, Mitch, and Nancy were certainly exceptional at firing the cash cannon.This isnxe2x80x99t going to be an argument about people trading their stimulus checks on Robinhood. But, that nationwide cash infusion wouldxe2x80x99ve certainly propped up businesses and industries, contributing to the overall state of the economy. You have a lot of people sitting on a lot more cash than theyxe2x80x99re used to.Like all great economic manias, there is always an underlying truth to the narrative driving things.\"10 years in 90 days\". \"Five years in five weeks.\" There have been a lot of different ways people have phrased it (McKinsey calls it \"the quickening\") but the simple idea is that longer-term digital trends have all rapidly accelerated due to COVID. This means that the Big Techs, the Shopifys, the DataDogs, the Pelotons, and their ilk will all tremendously benefit.It makes sense. Itxe2x80x99s a good story and one we are definitely in the midst of. But should Shopify be trading at 60x price-to-sales? Should Apple be worth $2 trillion? Should Tesla, I mean good lord, trade at whatever TSLA is trading at right now?The best piece I read addressing this priced-to-perfection market is from James Montier at GMO:One of my favorite definitions of risk comes from Elroy Dimson of Cambridge University who noted, xe2x80x9cRisk means more things can happen than will happen.xe2x80x9d I find this helps reinforce the unknowable nature of the future and highlights that history is just a series of discrete branches on a much larger tree. So, when I look at a very sharp recovery like the one we have all just observed, I canxe2x80x99t help but wonder if the world has forgotten about risk. It appears to be as if the U.S. equity market in particular has priced in a truly Panglossian future where everything is for the best in the best of all possible worldsBut what has been pushing that perfect pricing? Well, we have a large number of people who feel that things are improving, sitting on cash, and now we have a good story.Okay, now I have zero data on this :) But we started writing these newsletters to raise questions, or more accurately, bloviate theories, so here goes. The third element that has had an impact through the duration of the pandemic: Many people, especially among the investor class, are working from home.There are two parts to this: First, the impact on professional investors.Traditional finance is one of those industries where WFH was definitely not part of the culture. Face time at offices mattered. Being on the floor mattered. Networking in person mattered. It's definitely among the more conservative of industries in all these regards.A few weeks ago, I wrote about how the rapid shift to sitting at home and doom-scrolling is quickly and quietly transforming how many of us perceive the world. This can have dangerous outcomes, the clearest ones being QAnon or COVID disinformation. But, it's worth thinking about how that same shift has affected investors, both professional and amateur. For professional investors, it's worth understanding that while information flow is the lifeblood of performance, it's also somewhat controlled and restricted in an office setting. Lots of websites are blocked at offices; your information universe is limited to sources and channels deemed worthwhile by some compliance officer and knowledge manager working in tandem. With a Bloomberg Terminal you are clearly not going to be missing any major news but there is also some corporate filter keeping you away from dark corners. There's also the socializing filter of not wanting to have coworkers walk by and see you just scrolling Twitter or Facebook if those sites happen to be allowed. Consuming information in the office was a very specific thing, with norms and systems developed over the decades. That specific information flow drove markets.  I've now been seeing finance friends who had long shied away from finance twitter and the blogosphere diving into the deep end. Theyxe2x80x99re even sending me ZeroHedge links!!!!! This changes the topics followed and the general mindset. It definitely amplifies feelings of FOMO as algorithmic feeds are built to do. Tesla becomes a much more central company of conversation. People start having a much more emotional viewpoint on Gold.I won't get into whether this is a good or bad thing, but we should recognize the entire world of professional investing went from a highly-regulated information environment to the messy, infinite, and algorithmically curated one the rest of us without a Bloomberg Terminal have long navigated. I definitely donxe2x80x99t believe that a controlled information environment is better (Footnote 1) , but the speed at which people have been asked to adapt makes me think there is some discernible impact on markets. Of course, more people will be paying more attention to Tesla. Of course, more people will be sucked into the dominant market narratives. So the entire investor class is sitting at home and experiencing information in new ways. They are watching their own bank accounts grow and watching companies fulfill a market narrative as their stock prices simply cannot slow down. Why wouldnxe2x80x99t you crowd in? Even Masa Son is now invested in NFLX, TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, and SHOP! Side note: on compliance, I'm especially intrigued to see how WFH changes investor risk behavior. I canxe2x80x99t imagine there are no breakdowns in controls and risk monitoring when everyone leaves the office, but those things we'll have to wait to learn.And finally, letxe2x80x99s remember the merry band of Robinhood traders. The smartest thing I read about QAnon was that itxe2x80x99s like an \"alternate reality game\". It allows you to log on, start \"doing the research\", going down internet rabbit holes, and then thinking you are unmasking some truth the general population doesnxe2x80x99t know. All the while interacting and competing with thousands of others playing the same game.It's kind of like the stock market.Participating in the market always was kind of like some Massive Multiplayer Online Game. It's competitive. There are set rules. There are hundreds of thousands of participants. It straddles the line between the digital and the physical (servers, floor exchanges). You keep a very clear score.The stock market is really the perfect thing to \"do\" while sitting at home. It's exciting. There is constant motion. It's fun to talk about. You get really competitive. It can be played on your phone. You can get rich. And now take millions of people with some cash to burn, and it makes a lot more sense why you would see the retail trading boom.The Dave Portnoy pivot to stocks, love him or hate him, was a brilliant move. With no sports being played, trading could fill a lot of the same needs and the market was still definitely open. It also seems clear why everyone is suddenly trading options. It's just a lot more fun! Buying stock to hold indefinitely really does not get the juices flowing that buying an option expiring in a day and way out of the money does.There is plenty of debate on whether we can definitively attribute market moves to retail investors, but all these trends in confluence make me feel they are having an impact beyond their simplet trading volume. Itxe2x80x99s why Hertz and Kodak are topics even on CNBC. Itxe2x80x99s why Tesla, again, is doing what Tesla is doing (Ixe2x80x99m just watching in awe). Itxe2x80x99s why the entire market itself feels like itxe2x80x99s moving, in the same way, the lead stocks on Robintrack were. All this stuff works in tandem. I wonxe2x80x99t say Davey Day Trader and the Robinhooders are responsible for driving the market. But I do think they now play an outsized role in entering the headspace of hedge fund managers sitting at home, watching the markets go up and up, and flush with cash. Prior to early March, they survived on a steady diet of predictable newsfeeds, bank research, and newspapers, and now suddenly theyxe2x80x99ve been unleashed into a world of Twitter and Zerohedge. They are now very online but given no guidebook.It's probably clear from my past few pieces, I've been thinking a lot about how the WFH nature of the pandemic is changing the way we collectively think and interact with the world. There are very clear and present dangers, but when we look back, there will also be plenty of mundane, comical, odd, or academic second-and-third order effects we come to realize.There is certainly a whiff of mania in the financial markets right now, but there is also a feeling of confusion. Like many realms of life right now, itxe2x80x99s worth exploring how remote work has changed the markets. Davey Day Trader doesnxe2x80x99t come out of nowhere, right?Note 1: I want to make sure to clarify that I do not think the closed information environments of financial markets, especially through that of the Bloomberg Terminal network is a positive thing - even writing a post on this subject back in 2013 titled xe2x80x9cTear down that corporate firewallxe2x80x9d. A big part of the news startup, Informerly, I ran for nearly four years was trying to inject more blog and unconventional content into corporate newsfeeds! What worries me right now is simply the speed at which people have been thrown into this new world. Note 2: I still canxe2x80x99t believe that Point72 was apparently using Robintrack data.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Curious to why \"experience\" is a word you dislike. I always thought of it as a good way to describe things that well, you will *experience*, instead of a material possession. Basically none was prepared for WFH culture and suddenly it was imposed on many sectors.People working at office were not used to WFH, but now because of a few training sessions & planning now most of the companies are prepared for WFH. Especially IT companies are best prepared for WFH. So, slowly and gradually it will boost up market and economy. Many Mobile App development company like https://www.gojekclone.com/ are now fully working from home.No posts","title":"Is WFH affecting the S&P? - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/is-wfh-affecting-the-s-and-p"}

As with most things in 2020, we somehow went from a definite scandal to reputable people posting overly-panicked pictures of mailboxes in trucks to a DeJoy apology to finding out DeJoy is lying to right back to not knowing just how in danger our election is. I loved the opening line: In the Trump era, news doesnxe2x80x99t break, it invades.And later he continues:Itxe2x80x99s not just journalists who feel this exhaustion. Over the last four years Ixe2x80x99ve had countless conversations where friends, family, sources and random acquaintances remark that theyxe2x80x99ve felt forced to learn about the minutiae of the government during the Trump administration: the Hatch Act, the emoluments clause, the parliamentary procedure of impeachment. Lately wexe2x80x99ve added epidemiology, medical supply chains and antigen testing.This sudden literacy is not a result of a newfound passion for civics but a reaction to a torrent of lies and disinformation from the president and his associates. The New Yorker - 6 min read - 50 min cooking timeI recently ended up in a conversation about whether there is a high-end Wagyu equivalent of chicken. A few years ago I had the chance to go to Antoine Westermannxe2x80x99s Le Coq Rico here in NYC (which recently closed - not because of COVID, but rather mismanagement)  and had the famous Brune Landaise. It was really good. Of course, as things these days go, that conversation led to me find a heritage chicken at a Whole Foods and roasting it (using the poach-then-roast method). It was also good. While reading this article / recipe I learned about the xe2x80x9cOysterxe2x80x9d part of the chicken:But the whole, intact chicken, especially when roasted, has properties that you donxe2x80x99t want to lose by breaking it into bits: for instance, the three surprisingly satisfying segments of the wing, which you can eat with your fingers (youxe2x80x99d never bother with, say, the delicate little flappers of a tiny quail), or the wedge of yumminess surrounding the wishbone, or, possibly best of all, the xe2x80x9coyster,xe2x80x9d that teaspoon of tender meat residing near each thigh. In French, itxe2x80x99s called xe2x80x9cun sot-lxe2x80x99y-laissexe2x80x9dxe2x80x94i.e., only an idiot leaves it behind. This also led to a long rabbit hole of what exactly is Wagyu beef - I admit, I heard the xe2x80x9ccows get massaged by handxe2x80x9d rumor many times while out at trader dinners in the 2000s. This was helpful in finally giving me some clarity:Pressthink - 5 min readIxe2x80x99ve followed Jay Rosen, an NYU Professor of Journalism, forever. If every journalist followed his advice about how to cover Trump we would not be where we are. If youxe2x80x99ve never encountered it, go read the Citizenxe2x80x99s Agenda approach to campaign journalism.Hexe2x80x99s updated the original idea, into a somewhat more urgent call to action for every news media person out there:We know this sounds extreme. We wish it were not happening. We understand the risk we take by putting it so starkly: The presidency of Donald Trump is an active threat to American democracy. What do we mean by an active threat? Using the powers he won by election, the incumbent is trying to destroy public confidence in the results of the next election.Mel Magazine - 7 min readTherexe2x80x99s an alternate timeline where I never got out of the deep internet dive Ixe2x80x99ve gone in in the deep 2000s. There were many times I had nothing to do but go online and I did get sucked into weird conspiracy theories. This hit a bit close to home in that regard.Olivia, a 34-year-old teacher in Kentucky, had the xe2x80x9cgreat displeasurexe2x80x9d of watching one of her 14-year-old students become radicalized online. xe2x80x9c[He went] from a sweet kid to a year later tweeting that if homosexuals werenxe2x80x99t willing to change their ways, they should be killed,xe2x80x9d she says. xe2x80x9cHe then started tweeting about Black Lives Matter, immigrants, liberals, feminism and anything else he could get his hands on. This was a kid that was generally kind and quiet, but he began following far right figures on Twitter and the rest is history.xe2x80x9dThe Ringer - 14 min readI can still perfectly remember the every singe railing, every u-tube and every window of the warehouse level in Tony Hawkxe2x80x99s Pro Skater.  I was never really that good at it, but it was addictive in a way that you never fault inadequate or frustrated. Even when you fell, you were rewarded by seeing your tricks come to life. This was a great oral history of how the game and its infamous soundtrack came to life. I canxe2x80x99t wait to play the remake.Pease: Motion capture was mostly a marketing thing. xe2x80x9cWe need the footage of Tony in the suit to say therexe2x80x99s mocap to make the whole story more interesting!xe2x80x9d We didnxe2x80x99t need the mocap. But we went ahead and did the shoot and put Tony through the paces. He busted his ass off giving us all kinds of different tricks. He bailed on those ping-pong balls! It was fantastic to look at it on the computer and use it for reference, but it was way too late for us to get that data into that game. NY Mag - 13 min readI have mixed feelings on this one. On one hand, Olvia Nuzzi is a truly exceptional writer and this is a deeply reported piece on the shitshow that is the Trump 2020 campaign. On the other hand, every time I read a piece like this, I am reminded of the infamous Time cover, portraying the Trump campaign in a state of meltdown. August 2016 feels like a century ago now, but might as well be today.Seeing a path to Trumpxe2x80x99s reelection doesnxe2x80x99t actually require fantasy. If the pandemic subsides, if the debates wound the challenger, if the polling narrows a bit, the hidden Trump voter xe2x80x94 if such people exist xe2x80x94 and the design of the Electoral College may be enough. If circumstances get slightly less bad, if the president forms a habit of making things worse a little less often, if he gets a little luck just one more time, he could pull this off again. Maybe Kanye West, or doubts about the official results of the election, or ratfucking the Postal Service, or birtherism directed at Kamala Harris is all the campaign strategy Trump needs.Ethan Zuckermanxe2x80x99s blog - 4 min readOK, so, MIT Media Lab (which, unbeknownst to many, came out its MITxe2x80x99s Architecture school) has suffered a bit of reputational damage with the whole Epstein thing but it was home to a wonderful set of people too. This is a heartwarming love letter to a unique, creative culture where people form connections and bond over things as mundane (or wonderful) as a small piece of overly-elaborate gadgetry to open a window. Trust me, you have to read this.Ixe2x80x99m leaving the note because the previous occupant left me a note of sorts. I was working here late one night. I looked up above my desk and saw a visegrip pliers attached to part of the HVAC system. I climbed up to investigate and found a brief note telling the MIT facilities department that the air conditioning had been disabled (using the vice grips, I presume) as part of a research project and that one should contact him with any questions.BoJack Horsemanxe2x80x99s dark humor holds a special place in my heart and especially the last couple seasons where they focused on issues like mental health were one of the most interesting pieces of TV in years for me. But most importantly, Ixe2x80x99ve never skipped its intro ever: the music, the constantly changing references, its self-awareness coupled with a hint of melancholy captures the tone of the show perfectly. This was a wonderful recap on how the song and the intro come together.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Links on the Margins - Aug 20th - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/links-on-the-margins-aug-20th"}

Today we discuss how Silicon Valley seems to be taking off in the pandemic, while the rest of the country is sufferingIf America were a person and you asked her how shexe2x80x99s doing, what kind of an answer would you expect to get?Probably not a positive one. The country is being ravaged, both by a virus and a reality TV-star turned president, soon to come apart at the seams. The unemployment numbers are literally off the charts, and millions of people are soon going to risk eviction as they wonxe2x80x99t be able to make their rent. It is truly a bloodbath out there, from the looks of it. And, literally, the winter is coming which will surely put many of the virus related trauma into overdrive.First, the kids will either go to school and get their parents (and teachers) sick, or wonxe2x80x99t, and drive them insane at home. The cold weather will trap people in their homes, increasing the contagiousness. And if all that is not enough, let me remind you: we are a little under 3 months away from one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime. People will risk their lives to vote, and now more so that the leader of the free world is trying to suppress the vote by kneecapping the national postal service. Therexe2x80x99s no hope. Itxe2x80x99s all bad. We are fucked.But, what if America was not a regular person but was someone, say, who works in tech? What would she say? Probably something along the lines of xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s alrightxe2x80x9d:The stabilization has created a surreal disconnect between tech start-ups and the broader economy. While retailers, restaurant chains and many other companies are filing for bankruptcy and are dealing with one of the worst downturns on record, the tech industry has largely sidestepped the worst of the destruction.In fact, she might even be happier than ever. Obviously, many small companies [1] and especially those in industries like travel have taken a hit, but many of the big ones seem to be doing just fine. In fact, not just fine, but doing better than ever, at least comparatively so. This is some serious alpha:Why itxe2x80x99s important: Tech giants are becoming ever more important to the US economy. The six US-listed companies worth over $500 billion on Jan. 1 were Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Berkshire Hathaway. Aside from Berkshire Hathaway, the only non-tech company that made the cut, all of these companies valuation grew by more than 16% from Jan. 1 to July 22. Amazon is up nearly 70%. Without these five tech companies, the S&P 500 would have fallen by 5% since the start of the year, according to the New York Times. Berkshire Hathawayxe2x80x99s market cap actually fell by 15%.I know people love to say xe2x80x9cstock market is not the economyxe2x80x9d but that really does not do justice what is going on here. Again, Ixe2x80x99m on record arguing that xe2x80x9csoftware is eating the worldxe2x80x9d is actually a good tagline, albeit a bit overused, but that also does not capture the polarization of returns to capital in tech here. Before we go any further, letxe2x80x99s talk about why this is happening. For better or worse, the virus has accelerated The Great Restructuring of our economy. Almost overnight, we decided that we are going to do even more things online (hence software eating the world) and those who are better poised to take a bite out of that are seen as the potential winners. When you couple that with the fact that the overall pie seems to be shrinking, you can see where things are going. There are fewer holes to stuff your money in, and even a smaller number of those holes are guaranteed to not burn it. August 13th 2020Again, you can see how see plays out in real life. Entire streets worth of small, retail businesses are shutting down their physical locations, but they still need to sell things. So, they turn to Shopify to open an online store. Shopify uses Stripe for payments, which takes a cut. And Stripe runs their servers on Amazon, which again benefits. Shopify is seen as the new darling of the tech Twitter, but if your bet is that theyxe2x80x99re going to replace all the promenade streets and shopping malls of the world, they are still woefully undervalued. Same for Stripe, and Amazon.On one hand, this is expected and it is a good thing. These companies lowered the barriers to entry for millions of people to start a business online. If you want to sell something, you no longer need to rent a dingy space in a strip-mall and people no longer need to drive their gas-guzzling SUVs to your store and back. The world is forever changed. Now, you can just click a few buttons, and in less than a few minutes, the entire world becomes your addressable market. Especially in these dire times, this can be a lifeboat for many small businesses. I know about this personally. My brother has a couple retail stores in a touristic area of Spain. As tourists, especially from the US and China, have disappeared,  and the foot traffic dwindled to nothing, his only real source of revenue is the Shopify store he has, which he also promotes using ads on Instagram and Google. Again, this is tech in action, doing well while doing good, as the ever cheery Stripe founders would never let you forget.Patrick Collison @patrickcAugust 10th 2020On the other hand, it is hard not to be worried.One of the lesser-discussed impact of domination of the economy by the tech behemoth is how productive they are, per employee, compared to their competitors in other industries. Walmart, for example, employs more than 1.5M people in the US, whereas Amazon has around 275,000 employees. The Seattle behemoth is able to achieve 1.6T in market cap compared to Walmartxe2x80x99s 375B. This is a stylistic comparison, more than academic one, but the fact that Amazon is able to get more than 4 times the market cap with less than 20% of Walmartxe2x80x99s employees can be both a cause for celebration, that technology is good, and concern, that employment is not just money in peoplexe2x80x99s pockets but a source of dignity for many.The reason, for example, my brother is able to sell his good online with just a clicks is that instead of having to rent stores and hire people, he can benefit from the works of a bunch of Shopify employees. But when you think about how each of those Shopify employees serve not just my brother, but thousands, if not millions, of people, you can see where things go awry in the macro scale.August 14th 2020My brotherxe2x80x99s stores are closed and so are all the other ones in that touristic part. He no longer employs people, and neither do hundreds of other stores like his. He says the entire downtown is like a ghost town, with boarded up stores as far as the eye can see. Now, multiply that small part of Catalonia by thousands, and you can see how this is not a small crisis that will go away anytime soon. You just cannot optimistic-tweet this  away from sunny California. Again, therexe2x80x99s no denying that we would always be moving more and more of the economy online. I am a huge benefactor of this trend, both financially as someone who works (well, not currently) in tech but also as a civilian. I am glad I can make a doctorxe2x80x99s appointment using nothing but my phone, and I buy things on Amazon all the time. I talk to my friends and family in HD for free using the super-computer in my pocket and I still am amazed we got there so fast from when I had to wait for minutes for an MP3 to download on my dial-up connection.But, maybe we need to take a step back.The current debate thatxe2x80x99s going on how deindustrialization of America by the way of moving entire industries overseas in 70s feels like an apt analogy to what is going on now.The arguments of the decades past were not that much different from what tech is offering now. That by lowering the cost of production, wexe2x80x99d be increasing efficiency and that would eventually benefit everyone. Wexe2x80x99d be getting cheaper TVs, which we did, and eventually people who were laid off from factories would be able to find equally dignified jobs, which did not really happen.And you can take the similarities even further. Today, lots of people are rightfully worried about how not only we deindustrialized huge swaths of the country, but we also put all our eggs in one basket, which is held by our fiercest financial enemy. August 13th 2020This is not that much different, for example, than building our entire information age economy on ad-supported business. Now, a couple adtech companies like Facebook and Google have ravaged newspapers, and we are left millions of people getting their news from QAnon groups. No one did anything wrong [2] and everyone played largely by the rules, but we ended at a very bad place. We can rationalize all this as good things in academic language and give them fancy names, but the end result is a dire, sad one for our liberal democracies, which we may not even have for much longer. The dreaded unintended consequences do not just apply to regulation, but to any macroeconomic policy or phenomenon.But letxe2x80x99s go back to my original point. The divide between Silicon Valley and the rest of the country is wider it has ever been. Half my Twitter is people looking to angel-invest their millions in apps, and the other is reporters documenting the latest lows America has hit. This doesnxe2x80x99t bode well for the country, and will become a political and social flashpoint sooner than later. It surely is not sustainable. If the tech industry wants to enjoy its relative welcome, it should do more. This doesnxe2x80x99t necessarily mean working on pro-social, civic-minded enterprises, but also fighting for policies that can bridge the gap. Even when those policies can mean a haircut here or a trim there. We all need to do more than tweet good wishes and promote our companies here.Margins is where Ranjan Roy, a former Wall Street trader turned content strategist, and Can Duruk, a Silicon Valley technologist write about the technology of business, and the business of technology.1: Maybe therexe2x80x99s really no better example to show how the divide between tech and the real is widening than hearing that The Creamery shutting its doors. For those who are not as steeped in the San Francisco tech bubble: The Creamery was a small coffeeshop in SoMa where, especially in early 2010s, you could not get a table without running into some VC who is there to beta-test a new iPhone app or a tech reporter rubberneck for a scoop. The news of its closing brought together, for a brief period, both the tech journalists and the investor / exec class on my Twitter feed. Thoughts and prayers! f2: I am waving my hands here  quite a bit. I am not a lawyer, but it sure seems like there was quite a bit of anti-competitive behavior that led us here also. Ranging from Google pushing its own products to consumers who use Google Search to Facebook buying its competitors, therexe2x80x99s no doubt that there are reparations to be made.  For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.So, first, it takes a trader to use stock valuation as the numerator of a productivity equation. If we didn't live in the \"everything bubble\" that's been 100% financed by the fed, things would look different.Anyone who's lived through the deindustrialization of steel or autos knows the \"find other work\" thing is somewhere between an optimistic fantasy and a cynical sop. The reality is, the other, equivalent work goes to an increasingly small subset of young people. If we were to look at outcomes normalized for position in society, the picture would be pretty grim.The idea that Amazon is a great success only fits in a world where retail is an awesome outcome. So, one of the basic assumptions of the discussion is off. The same goes for advertising (Google, Twitter and FB's real business, given that they can't actually sell their products). (Don't get me started on Uber - low cost transportation based on exploiting people who can't factor the expense of running a personal car as a business into employment decisions. Microsoft, making us more \"productive\" for forty years based on nobody's metrics. Apple, the Hermes of smartphones. It's embarrassing, nobody does anything worthwhile or honorable.) And, yeah, the whole thing is ripping up the American fabric, so the only problem with the good, bad, and ugly is that it's all pretty ugly. The entire article reeks of SV bubble thinking.Covid accelerated exposure of the fractures that forty years of neoliberal \"greed is good\" / \"core business\" / \"profit is the only objective function\" have created. Anyone who's made money in the past ten years largely owes it to the fed mortgaging our future. The \"Greenspan put\" was amateur hour... child's play. So, we are left with haves vs have nots, SV and finance vs everyone else, educated vs ignorant, science-believing vs superstitions... Nobody at the top has  valued the health of our communities for more than forty years. And, everyone is armed.Thanks neoliberals!The very best part of the article was the fp pointer. With our current degree of living in two different realities, the idea that we could mount an effective challenge to China's onslaught is pretty laughable. Markets decide everything and the market will tell us if we need rare earths from Africa...only way after it's already too late. (It will probably make a fascinating business school case study about how markets mostly don't work well after all, given their deep problems with local optima and lack of strategic forethought... they're just better than Stalinism implemented with 1940s communication technology -- at the hands of Republicans, that seems to be the only comparison ever made.)Our future rides on two things: (a) our position holding the reserve currency and (b) that miracles really exist.(Btw, this is the third version I've typed in because whatever SV does in terms of making auth and accounts work well totally sucks.)Amazon has 876k employees. https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2020/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results/No posts","title":"The Other Digital Divide - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/the-other-digital-divide"}

This week wexe2x80x99re talking about text analysis, the way we communicate, and our robotic overlords.CB Insights was the first company I saw use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze earning call transcripts. They used algorithms to xe2x80x9creadxe2x80x9d thousands of pages of text to glean insight that no human analyst ever could feasibly do.In their typical style, they presented their findings in compelling, fun narratives (if you like this newsletter, youxe2x80x99ll probably like the one they produce). They wrote about stuff like whether corporate execs mention Voice products, or whether they use the term Big Data or AI more xe2x80xa6.They also did things like sentiment analysis on CEO language (how positively do they speak), or scoring CEOs on jargon usage. While these feel like fun NLP party tricks, you can quickly see how in financial markets, where everyone is looking for some hidden edge, this type of analysis will become increasingly valuable.(Most fascinating to me here was the seeming correlation between being scored as a xe2x80x9cpositivexe2x80x9d person and speaking in a lot of jargon. That says something about the models we use to analyze this stuff.)A friend of mine came up with the half-joke, half-serious business idea that we should coach CEOs and CFOs on what terms to use to trigger algorithms in a positive way. If you just use the right selection of words and tone of voice, maybe you could trick automated trading systems into spitting out buy orders. I came across a related academic paper that builds on the idea of analyzing public corporate executive speech (specifically social media feeds) to predict financial and operational performance. Side note: the paper introduced me to the term Upper Echelon Theory, which is a great management term that you should use in conversation this weekend. It states:Organizational outcomes are partially predicted by managerial background characteristics of the top level management team.Essentially who your managers are, will influence how your business does. Brilliant!Back to the paper: The researchers analyzed CEO social media feeds for \"linguistic cues\" to define a personality type for each leader (using the Big Five personality traits framework). They \"investigate the CEO personalityxe2x80x99s impact on both operational and financial performance.\"One of the straightforward findings was:We can see that CEOxe2x80x99s extraversion is positively related to cost efficiency. One feasible explanation is that extraverted CEOs are more sociable, which helps them build broad and diverse networks of social relationships. As a result, extraverted CEOs are accessible to more outer resources which are of benefit to reducing cost incurred to their own companies. Empirically, CEOxe2x80x99s high level of extraversion also improves employee productivity. It can be a result of they being more talkative, warm, enthusiastic and optimistic.A slightly more intriguing finding was:The most interesting and counter-intuitive empirical results come from the impacts of CEOxe2x80x99s conscientiousness and openness to experience. Conscientiousness is defined as self-disciplined, organized, strong-willed, dependable and achievement oriented, while openness to experience is defined as intellectual, curious, insightful, creative, unconventional and artistic. Intuitively, these two traits should be xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d characteristics. However, empirical results show that their impacts on business performance indicators are mostly negative. Conscientious CEOs lead to low cost efficiency. Itxe2x80x99s not just CEOs that are being algorithmically evaluated. Startups are already creating algorithms to help hiring managers understand how a candidate could \"fit\" into a company:\"We are very sharply focused on helping organizations hire faster and better at this point of time. Our analysis suggests that DeepSense can provide a 20-30% improvement in recruiter productivity while also lowering 'overall time to hire' by a non-trivial, measurable margin as well. DeepSense makes it possible by letting AI do part of the evaluation (esp. that around cultural fit and personality)Leaving aside the ethical questions of what data is being used to train the models used to evaluate \"cultural fit\", I would bet that the public language you use will increasingly be used to inform both professional and/or personal evaluations. Maybe the \"CEO earnings call language coach\" idea is a good one. Should everyone, from the CEO, down to the college student applying for their first job, start training themselves on how to better communicate to suit the algorithms that will eventually judge them? xe2x80xa6whatever the answer, you should definitely use Upper Echelon Theory in conversation this weekend.Wexe2x80x99ve always altered how we publicly present ourselves in the professional context. Itxe2x80x99s just being sensible. But that has always been to present ourselves in specific ways to other people. Real-life humans. Do we have to start changing the way we speak to also satisfy the algorithms?Job candidates can start figuring out how to game the systems that will analyze their body language, facial movements, and speech patterns in an interview. CEOs can finally hire me as an AI-speech training coach. But as I was thinking about the coach idea, it hit me: this is how so much of our online communication is. We already adapt our speech to please the robots.The entire world of SEO-driven article writing is real people sitting down and trying to figure out what combination of words will please satiate the Googles crawlers. The way we post on any algorithmically-ranked social media platform (which is....all of them) is to please the robots that will judge the words, images and video enough to seed them into our connectionsxe2x80x99 feeds. Real-life people will eventually have to Like or Retweet, but unless the robotic tribunal approves, it wonxe2x80x99t end up in anyonexe2x80x99s feeds. Itxe2x80x99s why everyonexe2x80x99s Instagram pictures look the same. The training has already begun.So what's the logical endpoint for our discourse? Any communication exchange that is even slightly algorithmically mediated is a natural candidate for optimization. Will the  most important professional skill become the ability to speak in a way that makes the algorithm happy? Will our entire lives end up looking like a LinkedIn feed? Usually, if you see a headline or post that has clearly been optimized for an algorithm, you find it a bit awkward. But the way we post does end up influencing the way we speak. Itxe2x80x99s like there is a robot-to-human spectrum, and while systems like Open AIxe2x80x99s GPT-2 are making machine-generated text sound more human, the robots, using tools like Gmail Autocomplete, are quietly training us to speak more like a machine. I always thought to pass the Turing Test, a robot would need to convincingly speak like a human. Maybe, as more of our speech becomes geared towards pleasing machines, the robots won't have quite as far a hill to climb to leave the Uncanny Valley. Or maybe theyxe2x80x99re already here xf0x9fxa4xafIxe2x80x99ve frequently referenced Winners Take All by Anand Giridharadas. He had a very important thread about the Mueller hearings, and whether Mueller shouldxe2x80x99ve adapted to the current state of communications & discourse, and given the soundbites that were needed to heighten the state of emergency on election interference. Effectively, you need pithy soundbites geared towards virality and algorithmic satiation to push a message. Thatxe2x80x99s just how things work now.This is something I am really torn on, especially in light of what I covered in this weekxe2x80x99s newsletter. Was Robert Mueller abdicating responsibility by sticking to an traditionalist interpretation of how things should work? Should he have accepted, if he really believes we are under attack, that maybe just give a soundbite? Would it be the same as FDR going on radio, or JFK going on television, and everyone just has to adapt to the medium and platform of the era?Or, given the platforms are algorithmic at their core, will a Trumpian figure always win these battles. Is our current information ecosystem transition something more pernicious than those of the past, and if itxe2x80x99s the game being played, the robots and dictators have already won.

Today, we talk data. Nothing personal.We talk a lot about data governance here. The main argument is that data comes not just as an asset, but also as a liability. The asset part is part is obvious. If you are in the ads business, data about your customers allows you to target them better, and charge more for your ads. The liability part is less obvious. For years, the thinking was that data is an unadulterated good. Yet, the tide is slowly turning. For example, as GDPR came into power and its enforcement picked up, even companies that youxe2x80x99d not immediately associate with data collection are and up having to pony up millions in fines. Itxe2x80x99s not like airlines are particularly profitable to begin with.Again, my argument has never been that data is not without value. Rather, we simply havenxe2x80x99t been able to account for its liabilities until now. Storage is practically free nowadays but governance is not. How do you make sure the data is accessed only by those who need to? Or more subtly, how do you make sure it is only used in the way you said you would use it? We are still figuring out these answers.For example, if you are asking people to enter (and verify!) their phone numbers  to improve your security, you end up with a bunch of phone numbers in your database. Now, can you use those phone numbers to target people as an advertiser? You probably shouldnxe2x80x99t. Itxe2x80x99s tempting, however, to think that you have all this data in your database, so why not use it? Itxe2x80x99s so much work to build all that controls and flags and tags to make sure data is not just stored, but also used properly. Engineers arenxe2x80x99t cheap, after all.Of course, that data has to come from somewhere. And itxe2x80x99s not that users are always losing something when they part with their data. Again, some of the examples are more obvious than others. Majority of people do not pay a dime to Google or Facebook to use their services. If you want to be academic about it, you could argue that people who advertise on Google and Facebook charge you higher prices, but how do you know theyxe2x80x99d not charge you more if they bought ads on the local paper.There are more interesting cases, however. For example, if you bought a Smart TV in the last few years, itxe2x80x99s probably subsidized to some degree thanks to the data it collects on you. Thatxe2x80x99s why sometimes non Smart TVs are cheaper than the smart ones. The tech that goes into making a TV xe2x80x9csmartxe2x80x9d is not expensive, but the data you get from figuring what people watch is enough to make the TV cheaper. Is that a win-win?Thatxe2x80x99s more of a philosophical question, and hard to answer. How you approach it really comes down to your personal politics too. If you are an individualist, you could argue that people who bought those TV sets consented to various privacy policies and knew what they were getting themselves into. Donxe2x80x99t want to get your data collected? Therexe2x80x99s no dearth of dumb TVs to be bought.But, that sounds a bit simplistic. First of all, It doesnxe2x80x99t sound reasonable to argue that we should subject people to hundreds of pages of legalese to catch the latest episode of The Bachelor (or The Bachelorette, I donxe2x80x99t judge). Smart TVs might be an improvement over dumb TVs (bear with me) in terms of functionality, but maybe we can take a more holistic approach. The more subtle argument is whether collecting this much personal data is something we should as a society put some brakes on. When you give up your data, itxe2x80x99s not just *you* thatxe2x80x99s affected. When you end up with a huge collection of personal data in one place, there are larger risks to society. You donxe2x80x99t have to go that far back, even, to come up with examples here.Facial recognition is an interesting case. I remember when identifying a face in a photo (i.e. xe2x80x9cis there a face in this photo?) seemed like magic, but now it seems like table stakes; a first year in a CS program could do it. Then the problem became facial recognition (i.e. xe2x80x9cwho is in this photo?xe2x80x9d). Again, for a while, it seemed like you would really need a lot of computation power and millions of tagged photos to figure that out. But now, the smartphone I carry in my pocket is able to miraculously tag my parents in photos that I took several years ago, without ever having to talk to a bunch of expensive servers in the cloud. Is there a cloud in my pocket?Again, one of my beats is that people (or me, at least) really under appreciate how fast technology develops sometimes. What is a hard CS problem that takes a whole bunch of PhDs is now a library that you can import into your application. This stuff is going to be everywhere. Last week, internet was abuzz with FaceApp, a fun app allows you see yourself (or anyone really) aged. Of course, it didnxe2x80x99t take people to realize itxe2x80x99s an app made in Russia. Since all-things-Russia is obviously bad, there were even American senators involved figuring out whatxe2x80x99s going on. This is an interesting moment for me to ponder. I do not have an antagonistic view of the government, like many Americans do. Generally, I believe most people in public service have good intentions, are capable, and have the best interest of people they serve at heart. So, while I may not agree itxe2x80x99s the best use of a senatorxe2x80x99s time to worry about FaceApp, given, ehem, today, but itxe2x80x99s fine.At the same time, however, I worry where as individuals our responsibilities start and end. If millions of people willingly download an app from various app stores, and then willingly upload their photo (yes, I know, you can upload any photo), who is at fault? Is it Applexe2x80x99s fault for allowing such easy access to the device camera, or not disclosing to people that itxe2x80x99s a Russian made app?It simply seems hard for me to imagine a regulatory framework by which we can prevent people from uploading their selfies. How do you make sure that FaceAppxe2x80x99s activity is restricted but people can still use Instagram freely? There are millions of selfies there too, and most of them even have the location tagged along also. Isnxe2x80x99t that even creepier? You could make the argument that Instagram is equally creepy and we shouldnxe2x80x99t let Facebook have access to so many photos either, but I donxe2x80x99t think youxe2x80x99d get a lot of support for that one.Or do we go full nationalist and segregate by origin? That doesnxe2x80x99t seem right either. What does the origin even mean, anyway, if the application is made by a Russian company but the photos are uploaded to a public cloud operated by an American company, on American soil? Or what would it mean if it was an American company that operated those servers in some other country, say, Singapore? Would it make it less creepy, or more so? There are societal benefits to collecting a lot of data, but there are also risks. My personal view is that we can mitigate a lot of the risks by making sure the data doesnxe2x80x99t get stored forever, and is responsibly discarded. Moreover, there are probably ways to get the value of the data, even in aggregate form, without building dossiers on every mere mortal on planet, so we should invest more in those.However, how we can generate, send over, and store that data is also a personal question. Itxe2x80x99s tempting and largely valid to point the lens of scrutiny on those who have the data and the power, but as individuals, we are also responsible. We control what apps we use, and what we do with them. Itxe2x80x99s fun to enjoy the fruits of technology, but part of the entry fee is to be a knowledgable consumer of it.A Spreadsheet Way of Knowledge: Therexe2x80x99s no end to how people use and abuse spreadsheets. Steve Ballmer, reportedly, uses Excel as a personal calendar, and Ixe2x80x99ve met people who use it to track the personal favors theyxe2x80x99ve given and received in a Google Spreadsheet. Fun! There are few pieces of software that have changed our world as deeply and widely as spreadsheets. They are everywhere, and they model not just our businesses but our life, our thinking. This is a good historical narrative on how they came out to be.[xe2x80xa6] He ran fifteen different scenarios on his computer, including one in which he took the money set aside for renovation and invested it elsewhere. What Maxwell found was startling: Not only would renovation be foolhardy, but xe2x80x9ceven the xe2x80x98best casexe2x80x99 showed Ixe2x80x99d get nearly as good a rate of a return on my investment in a money market fund as staying in the restaurant business.xe2x80x9d Get out of the restaurant business! the spreadsheet said. What the spreadsheet left out, of course was the unquantifiable emotional factor xe2x80x94 Maxwell loved what he did. He kept the restaurant (though scuttled the renovation)How to Hire: There are many ways tech companies compete with each other, but therexe2x80x99s no competition like therexe2x80x99s one for talent. Itxe2x80x99s hard to hire good people, harder to keep the better ones. But then, there are few more important decisions than who to hire and how. Whatxe2x80x99s a company, other than a bunch of people working together on a shared mission? This is a good talk by the Carta CEO in text format about how the company makes decisions. Nothing too controversial, but itxe2x80x99s a good overview and some bits are interesting.I want to repeat this point. We are increasing overhead by 50% because we failed to execute. It is not something to be proud of. It is humbling to go back to the labor market, hat-in-hand, asking for help. We did this when we hired you. We asked each of you to help us. You did not need us. There are plenty of great jobs. But we needed you. And thank goodness you came. We wouldnxe2x80x99t be here without you. But each of you was hired because the team before you failed to execute without you.

Today Ixe2x80x99m talking about Aquaman, how news sources embed tweets, and our collective lack of individual original thought.Whenever I'm watching some big sports match, TV show event (like Game of Thrones), political debate, or any other major cultural occurrence, and I feel like I notice something curious or a bit off, or if I even have some tiny idea that strikes me, Ixe2x80x99ll often end up at Twitter search.  Unfailingly, there will have already been a number of people tweeting my exact thought.It can be fairly boring stuff - like in the recent USA-Mexico Gold Cup final, I was annoyed by the amount of injury time awarded so I searched xe2x80x9c3 minutesxe2x80x9d:Itxe2x80x99s usually something trivial or mundane; like whether some celebrity looks chubbier than normal (sorry) or if someone's microphone volume is off at a political debate, or if there was a Starbucks mug in Westeros, but invariably, others were thinking, and posting, about the same thing. I think I search these things for affirmation, but I always find confirmation that others are thinking the same thing. It happens so often, Ixe2x80x99ve dubbed it the Rule of 140 (as an homage to Rule 34, along with the original Twitter character count):There are no original thoughts around a shared cultural experience (political, entertainment, sports, news). Every idea or observations that passes through your head has not only been thought of by a number of other people, it's also been posted on social media. The hive mind is always one step ahead.Just try it next time you're watching something. Seriously, it's kind of fun.The practice of embedding tweets has become an increasingly widespread part of writing articles. One of the reasons I love Substack, is how easily it allows you to embed a tweet in a newsletter (in Mailchimp and other email creation tools, this is painful). July 20th 2019Tweets certainly matter. It's how the President and any number of other world and business leaders communicate. There are hundreds of thousands of words published each day analyzing the content of words tweeted. For the past week, many of us have spent more time than wexe2x80x99d like debating the words of a certain tweet.But in those cases, the source and impact of the tweet are themselves the story. There is another genre of using tweets in articles that is a bit quieter and, in my opinion,  problematic. The one where writers use a tweet to replace what would've previously required finding a person to cite. Instead of having to find out a subject matter expert or relevant source, they can simply find a tweet. The one where a writer uses a tweet to represent some current \"public opinion\" or trending xe2x80x9cbeliefxe2x80x9d. You have the harmless stuff like Jason Momoa shaved his beard and people are freaking out!   Here, CNN informs us that \"people\" are reacting strongly to Momoa shaving off his beard by embedding four tweets. Itxe2x80x99s a nice, simple story. Itxe2x80x99s kind of true, I am a little freaked out that Khal Drogo shaved his badass beard. Momoa is doing this as part of some sponsored content effort to promote his new line of canned water (isnxe2x80x99t that as 2019 as it gets?), and the whole thing is commercial and weird enough to make the embedded tweets seem quite innocuous. But the author is still creating a xe2x80x9crealityxe2x80x9d off of a few social posts in a lazy journalistic manner. Itxe2x80x99s still CNN.Let's continue on the Jason Momoa theme. You may have seen he was recently fat-shamed. More accurately,  there were a few comments on an Us Weekly Instagram post that he wasnxe2x80x99t as ripped as normal. July 11th 2019This naturally led to hundreds of articles covering the topic of fat-shaming, a NY Post deep dive into Dad-Bods, and of course, Business Insider blessed us with, \"Jason Momoa is set to guest star on 'The Simpsons,' and his animated character looks ripped like him. Experts share what it takes to make a six pack 'pop.'\" Most these articles simply embed the back-and-forthxe2x80x99s on Twitter. The NY Post piece managed to actually write out full sentences, addressing @cultofdusty1 as a person:Wexe2x80x99ve started getting into the more emotional, personal stuff. By citing a few commenters and twitter posts, we can instantly generate a widespread debate on the topic of fat-shaming. Letxe2x80x99s make the jump from fat-shaming to white supremacy, with the story Chris Pratt criticised for xe2x80x98white supremacistxe2x80x99 T-shirtxe2x80x99. The author of this piece, Yahoo Movies UK (seriously, that's the listed author), embeds three tweets to inform us that 'people' are criticizing Chris Pratt for wearing a Dont Tread on Me Flag t-shirt, which apparently is a symbol used by white supremacist groups.This is where the practice starts getting a bit more dangerous. Wexe2x80x99ve already brought body complexes and gender into the equation. Now authors are working to bring racial animus in, spurred on by a small collection of tweets that donxe2x80x99t even quite say what the headline says they do. You see how easy it is for a news source to stoke a controversy with an incredibly low amount of effort. Just paste in the tweets, publish to your website, and you suddenly have people either wondering if they can watch the next Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and others ranting about if Hollywood has gotten too liberal and soft.Ixe2x80x99m going to now embed a tweet of a well-known journalist expressing a similar sentiment as this post. I will stand by this source as a reputable one and an expert in this field:July 17th 2019Also, a note: Since I first copied this article, I just went back and saw this incredible correction:  Update: This article was updated on 17 July with the initial headline, xe2x80x99Chris Pratt criticised for xe2x80x98white supremacistxe2x80x99 T-shirtxe2x80x99 being amended to xe2x80x98Chris Pratt criticised for T-shirt choice.' References to White Supremacism in this article have been removed. If you believe in the The Rule of 140 as I do, it means you can find any thought related to any event posted by someone, on some social media platform. I tend to view things in economic terms, and embedding tweets or social media comments is an arbitrage opportunity to exploit. A publisher can make any argument, and corroborate it with a few simple embedded tweets and a headline that includes \"people are saying\". The cost of production is so low, you can create a high volume of articles like this and something is bound to catch fire. Throw on a few Taboola modules and youxe2x80x99re in business. It captures every distorted economic incentive that plagues the current media ecosystem. Itxe2x80x99s the proverbial free money.  It would be one thing if it were simply relegated to the confines of Yahoo Movies and CNN's Entertainment section. But itxe2x80x99s widespread and in major media outlets. And of significantly greater consequence, itxe2x80x99s an area that is a prime target for disinformation campaigns, specifically of the Russian variety. Almost every major media outlet was found to have published articles that used tweets from Russian disinformation accounts.A Feb 2018 study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that:We searched the content of 33 major American news outlets for references to the 100 most-retweeted accounts among those Twitter identified as controlled by the IRA, from the beginning of 2015 through September 2017. We found at least one tweet from an IRA account embedded in 32 of the 33 outletsxe2x80x94a total of 116 articlesxe2x80x94including in articles published by institutions with longstanding reputations, like The Washington Post, NPR, and the Detroit Free Press, as well as in more recent, digitally native outlets such as BuzzFeed, Salon, and Mic (the outlet without IRA-linked tweets was Vice).There's another good analysis from Recode + Meltwater on the subject that dives further into just how widespread this problem was. Itxe2x80x99s the perfect disinformation target xe2x80x94 if you know people are seeking out confirmatory tweets and will publish them with no due diligence, then you make sure to create them. Major media outlets have repeatedly cited Russian disinformation account tweets as examples of existing American sentiment.The screenshot below is taken from a Columbia Journalism Review analysis of the U of Wisconsin studyKJason Momoa's abs and Chris Pratt's racial sensitivities are one thing. Russian electoral disinformation seeping into mainstream journalistic publications is a much bigger thing. But a more pernicious effect of this practice is the normalization of the \"people are saying\" discourse. I see it in regular conversation. Friends and family loosely cite their social media feeds as xe2x80x9cpeople are sayingxe2x80x9d. It usually revolves around some controversial viewpoint or topic, and itxe2x80x99s become the norm in published media as well. Wexe2x80x99ve moved from a publishing standard where we expect \"this specific person, who has this background, relevance and expertise, said this\" to simply \"people are saying\". This really matters, because we all know who is the king of this:Following the countryxe2x80x99s most deadly mass shooting, Donald Trump was asked to explain what he meant when he said President Obama either does not understand radicalized Muslim terrorists or xe2x80x9che gets it better than anybody understands.xe2x80x9dxe2x80x9cWell,xe2x80x9d Trump said on the xe2x80x9cToday Showxe2x80x9d Monday morning, xe2x80x9cthere are a lot of people that think maybe he doesnxe2x80x99t want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesnxe2x80x99t want to know about it. I happen to think that he just doesnxe2x80x99t know what hexe2x80x99s doing, but there are many people that think maybe he doesnxe2x80x99t want to get it. He doesnxe2x80x99t want to see whatxe2x80x99s really happening. And that could be.xe2x80x9dIn other words, Trump was not directly saying that he believes the president sympathizes with the terrorist who killed at least 49 people in an Orlando nightclub. He was implying that a lot of people are saying that.Thanks to the Rule of 140, anyone can justify any line of thinking. Any strain of conspiracy thinking, or any slightly controversial viewpoint, can be presented as conventional wisdom. To anyone reading on this sweltering weekend in the Northeast U.S, stay cool, and stay conscious of how you talk and write about what youxe2x80x99re reading on social media. Why did we wait so long for the bicycle? -  This history of the bicycle was a fascinating historical look at the innovations that made the two-wheeler possible, and also the roadblocks that made it take so long to invent:The bicycle, as we know it today, was not invented until the late 1800s. Yet it was a simple mechanical invention. It would seem to require no brilliant inventive insight, and certainly no scientific background.Why, then, wasnxe2x80x99t it invented much earlier?Dogs on treadmills: Publishers are finding LinkedIn isnxe2x80x99t just for business and careers - This section usually contains inspiring articles, but Ixe2x80x99m going to include one thatxe2x80x99s the opposite.

Can here! After a long break abroad, I am back in the land of the free, home of the brave. But more importantly, The Margins is back on its usual schedule.One question I get often is why I decided to get an MBA, and one abroad. I had a degree from a fancy CS school, and brand name companies on my resume. And besides, arenxe2x80x99t all MBAs basically the same; a bunch of young kids who spend a year or two partying around the world and then getting the same jobs; be it consulting or product managers?Therexe2x80x99s both a personal and a professional answer to that question. The personal side is simple. I wanted to be momentarily away from the Silicon Valley bubble I spent a good 8 years in. While I throughly enjoyed most of that almost-decade, it felt like I was developing a blind spot to the rest of the world. Most of my conversations revolved around tech and most of my friends were in tech. Spending a year abroad, spread between Singapore and France, surrounded by people not in tech, seemed like a good idea. And it was!The professional side is a bit more controversial. But herexe2x80x99s my contrarian bet on technology: While therexe2x80x99s seemingly an unassailable dearth of technology workers, especially in the Bay Area, the tech industry will also be automating itself, faster than most people are ready to appreciate. The lower end will is already experiencing this pain, but the bar will slowly move up.Let me give you an example. When I started my career in Bay Area at Digg, we owned hundreds of physical servers, colocated in a facility. There were people hired, especially to maintain those computers, making sure the blinkenlights kept on blinking in unison. While Digg was a had a sizable user base, especially for its time (and even by contemporary standards), itxe2x80x99s hard to imagine a company do the same today. You simply click a button on the AWS console, and more machines than you can ever need will be ready at your disposal.And this is really the most obvious example, but the bar keeps going up and up. What used to take 10 engineers 10 days to program is now a simple library on GitHub that you can import into your application with a few hours of tinkering. The always-eloquent Benedict Evans likens former white collar workers to cells in Excel. But you can take that analogy even further. Pivot tables replaced the lowest levels of analysts, and Tableaue reports went up even further.Looking at just the offering of AWS, itxe2x80x99s hard not to feel the same fate will hold for technologists too. Most of those products on that chart used to be someonexe2x80x99s full time job at a sizable tech company. Why do you need to have a full time database administrator when AWS has a turn-key solution for you? I am simply taking Amazon as an example here as they are The Cloud for most tech companies, but itxe2x80x99s hardly alone. Itxe2x80x99s Seattle neighbor, Microsoft has basically the same products, but also a few more especially focused on machine learning infused services. Simply drive alongside 280 in Peninsula and youxe2x80x99ll be inundated by billboard after billboard of companies offering similar services. Of course, you could argue that I am simply contradicting myself here; clearly these are tech products built by tech workers. Yes, you donxe2x80x99t need to build your payment infrastructure if you just use Stripe, but someone needs to build Stripe. And same for all those features on Amazon, and Microsoft, and so on. These companies need to hire people, but there are qualifiersAnd thatxe2x80x99s the other side of my argument. I believe as more and more of the bottom rung of the technology work is either automated or abstracted away, therexe2x80x99ll be more and more demand for the upper end. In other words, more specialization which will require deeper, more intensive training.Given most tech jobs are in states with unenforceable non-competes and at-will employment laws, these job markets are relatively liquid. This would ideally mean the compensation be relatively close to what would be suggested by the equilibrium of supply and demand. Yet, there are other factors like housing shortage in California and New York and a frothy venture capital boom artificially increasing salaries. Of all the companies I worked at over 8 years, almost none of them turned any profit, and even the one that eventually did go public is still not profitable. Therexe2x80x99s a horizon issue here, as profitability is hardly the goal of any growth stage firm. Yet, during all this time, I was gainfully employed and made a decent living primarily thanks to the largesse of the various venture capitalists and a zero interest rate environment. Is this forever sustainable?And therexe2x80x99s the curious market of coding bootcamps and the like. Itxe2x80x99s overall a good thing for society if more people can get high paying jobs without having to spend 4 years in college. And itxe2x80x99s a good thing for tech companies to come to their senses on giving up their obsession with fancy degrees, when a significant chunk of the work at even the most xe2x80x9chigh techxe2x80x9d firm is tying together different services, which hardly requires a Carnegie Mellon degree.On the other hand, what seemed like an amazing market, charging a fraction of what would cost people tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands in student debt, is now ridden with dead company after dead company. Most of the smaller players are already out, and the some of the big ones are having to offer more and more specialized degrees. Therexe2x80x99s also the Lambda School model, with clever financial incentive alignment and a heavy focus on initial student quality, but its success (if you take its outspoken CEO at his word) at this point is more the exception than the norm. Just because therexe2x80x99s a big demand for more tech workers, it doesnxe2x80x99t mean the demand is limitless and or we can or should convert our entire workforce to a bunch of coders.Compensation is hardly the reason, though, I wanted to switch my function. If anything, itxe2x80x99s more likely that salary prospects of a software engineer is brighter than most other functions in tech. The reason for my switch is that I firmly believe in increasing abstraction of technology. While discussing this piece with my co-host Ranjan, we initially disagreed on what I mean by that word; abstraction. Let me explain.In software engineering, abstraction means something specific. Namely, the idea is to hide the complexity behind an abstraction and only expose the important bits. A good analogy is the automatic transmission, which is an abstraction over (of?) the manual transmission. This means that you can either simply forget about changing gears entirely, which does come at a cost, or more recently, simply focus on changing gears instead of using a clutch pedal. This notion of abstraction means that you can do more with less. In the case of driving, your cognitive drain is reduced, and driving becomes easier. In case of the larger software engineering industry, this means that you can slowly focus less on what software is, and focus on what it does. When you donxe2x80x99t have to worry about the intricacies of your software and infrastructure, you can focus on the larger vision, and increase your leverage, and impact. In a world eaten by software, being a software person is going to be not just an advantage, but a requirement. But in a world of increasing software abstraction, the more in-demand skills will not be just ability to think in software. And not only that, software people will also have to think in terms of things they touch, which is everything. This is why, in the end, is why I decided to pursue a degree in business.And hey, if it all fails, therexe2x80x99s always philosophy. July 10th 2019Wimbledon 2010 live blog: 23 June: The Wimbledon final between Federer and Djokovic was epic, but itxe2x80x99s still nothing compared to the 2010 Wimbledon game between Isner and Mahut. At 11 hours, itxe2x80x99s the longest professional tennis match in history. And this liveblog from The Guardian was an epic hit when it came out. I am both amused and disturbed that I remember it so dearly:I'm wondering if maybe an angel will come and set them free. Is this too much to ask? Just one slender angel, with white wings and a wise smile, to tell them that's it's all right, they have suffered enough and that they are now being recalled. The angel could hug them and kiss their brows and invite them to lay their rackets gently on the grass. And then they could all ascend to heaven together. John Isner, Nicolas Mahut and the kind angel that saved them.Principles for a More Informed Exceptional Access Debate: I talked here about end-to-end encryption before. As more happens in bits over atoms, our base assumptions on which our civilizations are built are tested. Who gets to see what? How do law enforcement and intelligence organizations work and how do we balance their demands on data with individuals rights on privacy? This is a good primer on some of the basics on end-to-end encryption. I donxe2x80x99t agree with everything here, but itxe2x80x99s sober and introduces some good points.Law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been xe2x80x9cgoing spottyxe2x80x9d for some time, in that changes in technology continually changes what is available to law enforcement. Therexe2x80x99s no panacea that can solve all the problems law enforcement has with access to information. This article outlines how to enable the majority of the necessary lawful access without undermining the values we all hold dear. For the purposes of this article, wexe2x80x99ll use the term xe2x80x9cexceptional accessxe2x80x9d to mean a targeted government authorization to access, with the assistance of the service provider, the data belonging to a user when needed, for example as part of a criminal investigation or to stop terrorists. Itxe2x80x99s exceptional because almost all users arenxe2x80x99t affected by it and itxe2x80x99s not very common, on the scale of the total number of devices and the total number of communications enabled by the platforms.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Software Eats Itself - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/software-eats-itself"}

First thing. To everyone reading this newsletter, we can see if you read it, and how many times you opened it. If you never knew about email tracking, I understand that sounds weird. This is what we see:Email pixel tracking is an archaic (been around since the 1990s) technology that enables this. In the past, it was mostly relegated to bulk email marketing, but about a decade ago, startups popped up that made it part of a salespersonxe2x80x99s workflow. Soon, Chrome extensions made it possible for anyone to track from their personal inboxes, but only growth hacker-y type people paid attention. Recently, a buzzy startup made tracking your individual email recipients a core product feature. Email tracking from your inbox, allows you to see if, when, how many times, and in some cases, where, someone opened your email. I get it. Itxe2x80x99s creepy.Mike Davidson, who blogs at MikeIndustries, wrote a thoughtful post on how Superhuman teaches its users to spy on their friends and family. The same technology that quietly lurked amongst salespeople & marketers, is now turned on by default, for your personal inbox.  He outlined a ton of really creepy scenarios where this could be used, such as:The key point: The people you email don't know they are being tracked, which makes this a flagrant privacy issue. There's a whole host of sub-debates, and if you want to dive in, I'd strongly recommend reading the post. It's really good (along with his followup).The Background: I first learned the Dark Arts of Email Tracking while working at the Financial Times. I was running business development for a $5,000 a year subscription product. We used Salesforce. We also had a daily newsletter and I quickly realized I could cross-reference newsletter open data with sales email open data to see which readers were highly engaged with us. They were reading our newsletters and opening my sales outreach emails, so they naturally made for better prospects. Ixe2x80x99d try a little harder with them.That seems reasonable, right?This made the act of email tracking seem natural. Over the years, I generally kept business email tracking as part of my workflow. And thatxe2x80x99s honestly how I thought of it, as a workflow thing, with zero regard for the privacy implications. It was just standard sales stuff.Critical Note: I had installed Yesware, one of these tracking tools, on my personal email a long time back. Right away, it felt incredibly creepy to me and I removed it. This is important, especially for any of our readers still weirded out that we know if youxe2x80x99re reading.Side note: Substackxe2x80x99s dashboard does not provide location data so wexe2x80x99d never know where you opened the email. But, to repeat, we know if, and how many times you open. A tiny 1x1 image pixel is inserted into the email. Every time you open the email, that image is loaded which sends data back to the email sending platform. If you forward it to a bunch of people, it will register all those opens directly to you. A lot of people (including my co-host Can) express incredulity as to the reliability of this data.Ixe2x80x99ve tested this. A lot. I've sent emails and opened them on different devices, browsers and clients as controlled experiments. There are a bunch of quirks and itxe2x80x99s nowhere near 100% accurate, but it's reliably, directionally right. If you see someone opening a lot, on a repeated basis, there's a high probability they're engaged with your newsletter.This entire kerfuffle was a reminder for what job function blinders can do to your perspective. I assumed everyone knew about email tracking. Not only do marketing and sales tools not hide it, companies like Hubspot celebrate it, with case studies like \"Here's how email tracking helped close a $100,000 deal\":xe2x80xa6and they describe the feature with language aggressive enough to make a Superhuman blush:With SalesHub Email Tracking, you're provided with more than just valuable information about your contactxe2x80x99s engagement with your emails. You also get to see their professional history, where they live, details about their company, their twitter feed, social profiles (emphasis added), your email history with them, and more.It really works for direct sales. If I ever saw a lead suddenly open an email after a few weeks, and I subsequently reach out, Ixe2x80x99m much more likely to get a response. I assumed this was an accepted industry standard, but Mike's piece definitely made me feel dirty about this. I remember little moments, like where I saw the location data of a leadxe2x80x99s open, and thought \"oh, it's August and they're in Greece. Must be nice.\" That's really weird. And the more people understand this, the more theyxe2x80x99ll be conscious of if/when they open any email. Individual Email Tracking = a Dark Art.Ixe2x80x99m glad this conversation has been started, because in the hierarchy of email tracking, the idea of using it in your personal inbox is really, really creepy. For work emails, Ixe2x80x99m finally moving towards the mindset itxe2x80x99s problematic (especially for any non-sales function, like with your boss). But for newsletters, it's an incredible thing and a very important soldier in the battle to save our attention. Even Mike, along with many others appalled by Superhuman, were in agreement newsletters are xe2x80x9cdifferentxe2x80x9d (from Mike Davidson):Ixe2x80x99m generally not moved by straw man arguments that attempt to paint bulk newsletter analytics with the same brush as email surveillance. News organizations are well within their rights to employ the former while criticizing the latter.From Mike Isaac:July 3rd 2019But I do worry, if everyone blocks images in email, and email clients starting turning them off by default, it would kill the ability of newsletter creators to acquire this data, and that would be really bad. Herexe2x80x99s why.I had to google the opposite of Dark Arts, and apparently from Harry Potter, it's Light Magic. I've never seen any of the movies or read the books. Ixe2x80x99m not proud of that or anything, I just never have.Back to fact that we can see if you, the reader, have opened this Margins newsletter, and how many times you have. I want to not only make sure youxe2x80x99re aware of this, I want you to know how important it is to me.User-level analytics force you to think about your audience as real-life people. It's almost emotional. It bestows a humanity to the entire process. It's no longer just numbers on a dashboard, or celebrating \"100,000 pageviews\" or \"10 million video views\". Bringing this stuff down to the human level makes it more like Kevin Kelly's 1,000 True Fans. This is important. So many of today's media and tech problems are from the creator's detachment from the end consumer, where you see numbers, not people. Looking at the activity of individual email addresses, where you recognize many of them, forces you to think about the people reading you. When you write, youxe2x80x99re writing to real people. We stress about this side project because of the caliber of domains and people reading. The Substack Analytics dashboard perfectly outlines the people vs. numbers distinction. They have two prominent metrics on the dashboard: Total Views and Total Opens.Some real-life Margins data from the early days:Total Opens is the aggregate number of email opens as per the tracking pixel. Total Views (we assume) is the number of Webpage Views of the post (a standard Google Analytics-style pageview number) + Total Opens. Subtracting the two (1,143 here) gives you the web-only views.We write the Margins just to write, but affirmation certainly helps. A lot. Total Opens is where our core audience lives, and Total Views is where the non-email, non-core viewership happens. That difference is almost a proxy for how appealing it was to a widespread audience.If we just started writing about Trump (xe2x80xa6.or Sweetgreenxe2x80x99s impact on society), that proxy is almost invariably higher than the wonky stuff. Luckily, we have no monetary incentive for pageviews, so I feel comfortable writing 2,000 words about email analytics, but the validation is from knowing the right 10-20 people are reading. YOU CANNOT HACK TOTAL OPENS. High total opens, from the same person, over an extended period of time, is one of the purest media metrics there is. You can trick someone into opening your email with a clickbait-y subject line, but that kills the relationship. The only reason someone chooses to open your email, out of all the shit in their inbox, repeatedly, is because it's at least somewhat interesting to them. But Ranjan, donxe2x80x99t you see real people and names in your social media interactions?This is a very important distinction to me. We love when y'all tweet and share our stuff (and please continue to do so), but anything publicly posted carries at least a sliver of a performative element. It's like how my co-host Can and I have some exchanges directly on Twitter, while some things we reserve for The Margins Slack (xe2x80xa6.right, Can?). There is nothing performative about repeatedly opening a newsletter. You get no followers, or Likes, or public credibility of any sort. It's a quiet, peaceful way of demonstrating true engagement. Itxe2x80x99s the holy grail of content analytics; a pure, unadulterated glimpse into real people liking what you're doing.But, it's the same private nature that makes it so valuable and real, which makes it creepy. Itxe2x80x99s the lack of transparency that makes it weird. Which is why I'm glad Mike brought this up, because I want people to be aware of this, and I want us to get rid of the bad stuff (individual email tracking), so we don't lose the good (bulk newsletter tracking). And again, we might notice your email address if youxe2x80x99re opening this newsletter, and itxe2x80x99s what makes this whole project worth it. This might all come off as weirdly intense, but itxe2x80x99s because the field of newsletter analytics is coincidentally what I'm professionally obsessed with. Our team has been conducting an interview series on the exact topic of going deeper than aggregate metrics and human-scale email analytics. Media companies are starting to shift away from chasing blind, anonymous traffic, and email is a big part of leading the way. With our company newsletter, we periodically review readers wexe2x80x99ve deemed important. If they are not engaged, we try to figure out what we could be doing wrong? We also start conversations with our engaged readers, and sometimes send them stuff.I like to think of it like if you go to a hotel or airline and they surprise you with some personalized service. xe2x80x9cHey Mr. Roy, wexe2x80x99ve seen you order steak so herexe2x80x99s one on the housexe2x80x9d. Itxe2x80x99s wonderful, because theyxe2x80x99re using your data to better serve you. Thatxe2x80x99s kind of the dream here.Email is such a quirky, weird, beautiful thing. Anytime you use a closed ecosystem app (Facebook, Twitter), it's sucking up far more data. Email only has a few data points, and it's one of the few where the creators, themselves, have real access. Our audience is ours. That ownership is a privilege, especially when we know that people we respect are reading. Itxe2x80x99s not just me - you can see just how passionate newsletter creators are about the ownership of their audience in this Twitter debate about a new breed of newsletter aggregators like Stoop Inbox. We donxe2x80x99t like living in a world of disintermediation:December 5th 2018So letxe2x80x99s keep email analytics weird. Letxe2x80x99s make any kind of individual email tracking a thing of the past. Superhuman should go further and get rid of it, and Salesforce, Hubspot, Mailtrackr, ToutApp, along with the entire crew should remove it as a feature. Everyone should become aware that tracking exists and that their open data is being sent the newsletter creator, and that creator should invest time using that data to better serve their audiences. Thanks to Mike for starting this conversation, and even better, writing a proper, old-fashioned blog post. And thanks to Superhuman for taking some action (though not enough according to Mike). Thanks to all the media folk who covered it, and, maybe, thanks to the arrogant folks who made this more of a social media battle than it might have otherwise been. Maybe to make people stop and think about something, you need villains as part of that process nowadays. If you made it this far, thank you for reading, and if you have any thoughts at all, please send them in. As you can tell, Ixe2x80x99m really interested in this stuff.One last piece for any Future of Media-ish folks. Ixe2x80x99ve always been fascinated by the idea that media companies should take on more of a CRM mentality, not just the salespeople, but the journalists as well (from a 2014 piece I wrote):Imagine if the entire editorial staff at each of these companies was entirely focused on that same collection of user information. Their first stop in the morning was not a CMS, but a CRM. Their collective job was to make sure each one of those individuals was properly informed. It could be writing articles, finding links, navigating social media, giving talks, making introductions to experts, aggregating data, literally anything that helped inform your individual users.Instead of guessing what might be important to an audience of unknowns, you would actually know, youxe2x80x99d see the results, and youxe2x80x99d constantly improve. There would be real people with real feedback letting you know if youxe2x80x99re doing your job.Imagine if the core of a media organization was that CRM-like collection of information, individual-level, unified views of every single user you touch. Your single most important asset was that amassed collection of relationships, 1:1 relationships between your entire firm and that individual user.xe2x80xa6thank you for coming to my TED Talk :) For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Superhuman and Human-Scale Media - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/superhuman-and-human-scale-media"}

I am generally ambivalent about cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. While I appreciate the excitement it injected into a old, stodgy industry (at least from the outside, sorry Ranjan), I canxe2x80x99t tell whatxe2x80x99s real and whatxe2x80x99s outright scam generally. Anyway, Max Read skips over the technical mumbo-jumbo, and focuses on what Facebookxe2x80x99s new currency would mean for other currencies, were it to work. There are lots of assumptions there, but I enjoy thought exercises and Max is an excellent writer.But what if xe2x80x94 bear with me now xe2x80x94 you had a stable cryptocurrency, created with regulator and institutional accession, and already in frictionless circulation among 2.3 billion people? Plenty of economists and central bankers have suggested that a supranational instrument might make for a better reserve currency than one printed by a national monetary authority. John Maynard Keynesxe2x80x99s proposed currency, the xe2x80x9cBancor,xe2x80x9d is notable in that it might actually have a worse name than Libra, but it also seems to presage the ambition of Zuckerbergxe2x80x99s project xe2x80x94 albeit as the product of an international system of cooperating sovereign governments, rather than as an app created by a Roman Empirexe2x80x93obsessed programmer. Libra, Explained: I am sorry. I used to joke that my goal with The Margins is to write the longest standing newsletter without ever mentioning the B-word and here I am mentioning another piece about the Facebook cryptocurrency. As I mentioned above, a lot of my skepticism about the currencies other Bitcoin is that they dilute the original ideas behind the Satoshi paper so much to fit their aims, I lose interest at best, and become hugely suspicious the entire thing is a house of cards, built on technical jargon thatxe2x80x99s opaque to practically everyone. Verge writer Elizabeth Lopatto shares some of my concerns, and has a pretty funny and informative take on more technical aspects of the topic.I keep noticing therexe2x80x99s this stuff in here about being decentralized xe2x80x9cin the future,xe2x80x9d but from the jump, itxe2x80x99s coming out in centralized form. They call this centralization xe2x80x9cpermissionedxe2x80x9d in the paperwork. Basically, the first version of Libra is controlled by the founding coiners. You know, the ones who also get to keep the interest. (There is a vague plan for expanding this initial cabal in five years or so. Any new members of the cabal will have to meet its requirements, which are substantial.)The Lingering of Loss: The thing with losing someone close to you is that the loss is the beginning, not the end. From that point on, your life is on a different trajectory. It gets easier, surely with time, but the feeling remains intact. If I may say, at the risk of sounding insensitive, it even becomes xe2x80x9cenjoyablexe2x80x9d as it becomes part of your life, as you learn to live with that feeling, maybe in a feeble attempt to keep the person alive and well. It hurts, but you know that things havenxe2x80x99t ended. What used to be the hard part, the lingering, becomes the part that makes the sadness be worthwhile. This piece touches on that, and really more. Worth your time.Another ten years passed. Twenty years: a generation. The boys donxe2x80x99t wear mittens anymore. Their feet are much bigger than mine, even bigger than Janexe2x80x99s. But I still miss their baby feet, and their patter, and the piffle of childhood. I reel at a babyxe2x80x99s cry.

The books had always been for Jane. She heard, she knew. Did she know?The MBA Myth and the Cult of the CEO: A question that comes up is xe2x80x9cWhy do CEOs get paid so muchxe2x80x9d? We talked about compensation packages quite a bit here at The Margins. The overarching theory is that the pay is set by the market; you pay people just enough to keep them at employed. This theory sort of breaks when it comes to CEOs however. The most popular theory, at least in public company CEOs, is that their pay should be tied to the stock performance. This piece pierces some holes in that argument, and more. Did I mention I am literally graduating as an MBA tomorrow?We ran similar regressions controlling for industry and found that xe2x80x94 even after controlling for industry xe2x80x94 elite MBAs did not produce positive statistically significant alpha. Elite MBAs did perform relatively well as CEOs in healthcare and consumer staples, but relatively poorly in energy and materials businesses, though those results were not statistically significant. Our study is not the only one to come to this conclusion. A study by economists at the University of Hawaii asked similar questions and found that firm performance is not predicted by the educational background of the CEOs.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Summer Reading - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/summer-reading"}

Today we talk about targeted advertising.Midway through the pregnancy of our 2nd child, my wife asked me what I thought of a device called the Willow Breast Pump.  While I had exhaustively researched every possible baby gadget for our first kid, this was something I hadn't really explored.Willow, and a similar product from a company named Elvie, were both iPhone-ifying an incredibly staid industry. I won't get into the details for the uninitiated, but the world of breast pumping is one of those things, before parenthood, you just have no idea (or at least I had no idea). As the pressure on mothers to exclusively breastfeed has increased, the technology enabling them to do so feels like its straight out of a 1980s hospital. Itxe2x80x99s a constant, audible, omnipresent reminder of your wifexe2x80x99s sacrifice. These new disruptive products were quiet, discrete, and comfortable - the exact opposite of what's out there now. If startups are meant to solve painful, awful problems, this was certainly one worth attacking.The reviews were fairy consistent. These products were good, but early. Willow was close to launching it's 2nd gen product at the time, and the Elvie was soon-to-be launching (they're both out now). The consensus seemed to be, the Willow Pump had a steep learning curve, which often required a (complimentary) online coaching session, wasn't quite as effective as traditional pumps, and was multiples more expensive than current products. In other words, it sounded like any early-stage tech product. There was a ton of promise, it would work pretty well, but there would be a lot of frustration.Now, I love nothing more than buying the first generation of a gadget and poking around. My wife is supportive of my early-adopting addiction, but usually at an arm's length. Even after walking her through the universally acknowledged downsides, she was adamant about wanting to try it. I was kind of excited as it meant a cool new gadget in the house. Then I saw her Instagram feed. It was plastered with sponsored Willow posts. Elvie ones too, and that product wasn't even out at the time.This annoyed me. But it made a lot of sense. She follows a bunch of Mom-related Instagram accounts. There were baby bump pics posted. Instagram could probably even figure out our approximate due date from photo captions. Any old algorithm knew she was an expectant mother.Our son was born. The Instagram ads continued. We bought the Willow. It's pretty incredible.It was exactly as expected. It's revolutionary. It's early. It's iPhone-ish. There have been frustrations. It was expensive. There is no doubt in a decade this style of pump will be better and everywhere. Investors, get in on their next round.But I just can't shake that discomfort with the marketing process. Both of these companies have raised a ton of venture (Willow $42.5mm, Elvie $42mm) which naturally meant theyxe2x80x99d be hitting the gas on platform growth strategies.  Repeatedly promising to solve one of the most difficult and painful parts of an entirely difficult and painful time, in a hyper-targeted, algorithmic manner. Is that okay?Where do we draw the line with micro-targeted advertising?This was the perfect grey area case study. Perfect enough that I'm willing to risk my wife's ire after she sees I posted this (youxe2x80x99re the best wife and mother ever!).Willow is trying to tell their target customer about their cool new product. Itxe2x80x99s just a standard marketing problem to solve.Sitting poolside. A number of Willow-clad women doctors. A mommy-blogger and her luggage, jet-set ready. Willow pumps on the beach. Netflix and pump. You can be successful, beautiful and not give up an ounce of your lifestyle. You can be free. All thanks to the Willow Pump. It's so good.But what's an ethical standard for how you target your consumer? You'd naturally want to target expectant or recent mothers. Should there be a limit of 'x' posts per day? Her feeds were littered with repeated ads. What about the timing? Can the platform ascertain the approximate due date? Can you pay a data broker for 3rd party info that confirms this (from babycenter.com or something)? Can you step up the number of ads shortly after birth, knowing how sleep-deprived the customer will be? Can you target ads between 1am-5am, knowing those are the hours a mother is exhaustedly breastfeeding while scrolling Instagram to stay awake?What is the line when you have incredibly clear data points as to when your target customer is at their most susceptible? What if you have a great product that you genuinely believe will solve their problems; do the ends justify the algorithmic means?Full disclosure: my legal knowledge base on this topic is from just a few web searches. Last week we discussed how the subscription-ification of the economy will require a rethink of subscription management processes. The evolving nature of targeted advertising requires an even more urgent discussion around what is okay?The most recent regulatory development I encountered started with the 2016 ProPublica story where they showed how real estate ads could systematically discriminate against specific racial groups. In March 2019, Facebook announced they would prevent housing, employment and credit services from excluding audiences using gender, zip code or race. But these are all focused on the exclusionary, not the inclusionary. What about limits on who, when and how advertisers can target someone?There was a Do Not Track Kids Act in 2011 that was expanded in 2018, which requires parental consent for data collection on minors as old as 16. It prevents them from using any collected data to behaviorally target kids. (Note: It freaked me out to read that 90% of children under two have an identifiable digital footprint, that can begin even before they are born. Our kids probably fall into this).  I would hope, societally, we can agree that kids under 16 should not be tracked and targeted. Protecting kids seems like a good place to start.But what about a woman who is in her 3rd trimester or has just given birth? What about a father with a new child? After the birth of our first kid, anyone promising to make my kid a little safer and my life a little easier had my undivided attention. The baby industrial complex is strong and I was incredibly commercially vulnerable. Targeting someone who has been identified as overweight with a diet product seems reasonable. But what about seeking out those who have been posting depressive things? Sentiment analysis is only getting better. Marketing payday-ish lending products to lower-income consumers is uncomfortable, but it makes sense. You donxe2x80x99t want to waste ad dollars on wealthy consumers. But what about targeting them a few days before the typical paycheck cycle, when you know they're at their most financially strapped (Earnin app, anyone?)?xe2x80x9cPeople consistently tell us that if theyxe2x80x99re going to see ads, they want them to be relevant. That means we need to understand their interests.xe2x80x9d - Zuck in the WSJ Writing this post reminds me of how difficult regulating this will be. Everything Ixe2x80x99ve described above is theoretically in the consumerxe2x80x99s interest. Moreover, so much of this stuff exists on a sliding scale or spectrum, and advertising has always been targeted in some capacity. Ixe2x80x99m currently at my parents house and every CNN ad break is stuffed with pitches for reverse mortgages and prescription medications. But it's only a matter of time before we move past broad demographic cable TV and radio ad buys to personalized, targeted ads lining all of our media consumption. As consumers, we're only going to continue to create more identifiable data, and the technology which can comprehend and process that data this data will only get better. How do we begin to set limits on what is acceptable? I always lean towards transparency as the nearest-term solution. Providing consumers with a greater understanding of how and when theyxe2x80x99re targeted is a good start. The Facebook Ads library, can show me what ads Willow posted, but not how much they spent or when and how they targeted us. I would love to know that.Finally, as this piece is on parenting + tech, Ixe2x80x99ll leave you with this photo that I hope does not create any digital footprint for my new kid. This is how this piece is being typed:xe2x80xa6or more accurately, what Ixe2x80x99m listening to. Ixe2x80x99m a big fan of Axiosxe2x80x99s Pro Rata podcast hosted by Dan Primack. Relevant to this piece, the podcast has recently been sponsored by Facebook. The ad segments are Facebook espousing the benefits ofxe2x80xa6.targeted advertising. Ixe2x80x99ve seen Axios get a lot of flack for having big corporate advertisers, but itxe2x80x99s very comforting to me to see them sponsored by Facebook, in the very same pieces of media where they rip apart Facebookxe2x80x99s business model. It kind of has an pre-digital media feel to it (the Facebook ad starts around the 1:56 mark):Black Market T-Mobile Location Data Tied to Spot of a Triple Murder: From the data brokering frontlines, an insane story from VICE:In this Texas case, the data of the bounty hunter's phone first trickled down from a telecommunications company acquired by T-Mobile, according to a screenshot of the phone ping obtained by Motherboard. Then, the data moved through a location aggregator called LocationSmart. From there, LocationSmart sold that access to CerCareOne, a company that operated in secrecy, and which told its clients to not even reveal the company's existence.CerCareOne had around 250 bounty hunter and bail bondsman clients for real-time location data, according to previously leaked CerCareOne documents. For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Parenthood and Instagram Ads - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/parenthood-and-instagram-ads"}

Today, we talk about a product that works well and why that might be...bad for us?I work in academic economics. In economics, there is a standard story for how competitive markets work and why that is, on net, good for society. The story goes like this: for any good or service (letxe2x80x99s say apples), there is demand (people want to consume it) and supply (people and companies make it because they can economically profit from it). The suppliers are incentivized to make apples that are superior (taste better, are less likely to go rotten, etc) or cheaper to beat out their competitors, and so they will attempt to make their apples xe2x80x98betterxe2x80x99 from the standpoint of the consumer, and they will innovate to do so. This means that consumers will get better/cheaper apples, and this is good and desirable.There are ways that a market can go wrong, such as whatxe2x80x99s called an xe2x80x98externalityxe2x80x99 (ex. a company can drill for oil), which we want, but as a side effect that isnxe2x80x99t fully taken into account that oil will release fossil fuels into the atmosphere, which is bad. But for the most part, if a company is innovating to provide a product that is superior to existing alternatives in terms of quality or cost, this is a market-level improvement.Keeping that in mind, I want to talk about a company called Robinhood that has won awards for innovation. Robinhood is an app that enables you to trade securities (stocks, ETFs, options, etc) commission-free. This means that you can link up your money and buy, say, 100 shares of Walmart using Robinhood and it will not charge you any money for providing that service.How significant is this? Robinhoodxe2x80x99s valuation is reportedly around $7 billion and growing fast. About half of Americans have wealth in the stock market in some way, usually through a retirement/pension fund, and about 14% own stocks directly and 7% say they trade stocks and other funds xe2x80x9cregularly.xe2x80x9d These are millions of people who are known in finance as xe2x80x98retail investorsxe2x80x99- individuals who arenxe2x80x99t professional investors or investment institutions like mutual funds, endowments, etc. And before Robinhood, these people were paying through the nose to move their money. For example, Fidelity, a large financial services company, says it provides xe2x80x9cindustry-leading valuexe2x80x9d by charging youxe2x80xa6 $4.95 per trade. And lots of firms charge way more! This is Ticketmaster-level extraction from consumers while the actual cost of executing most equity trades is only a tiny fraction of this fee. These dinosaurs absolutely deserve to be disrupted. So it must be a win for society that Robinhoodxe2x80x99s commission-free trading service is grabbing market share from them...right?There is one catch: Robinhood makes revenue from routing your trades to high-frequency traders in exchange for a fee, which might mean that youxe2x80x99re not getting the best available price for a security in the market at any given time (Robinhood says xe2x80x9cwe send your orders to the market maker thatxe2x80x99s most likely to give you the best execution qualityxe2x80x9d).But therexe2x80x99s a more fundamental problem, which is that you, a retail investor, shouldnxe2x80x99t be trading stocks, and Robinhood is making it easier for you to do something you shouldnxe2x80x99t do.For a long time, one of the biggest stories in finance has been the rise of index funds, which are funds that do not attempt to outperform the market as a whole, but simply hold securities from across the market and so perform at the aggregate marketxe2x80x99s level. Why would this be desirable? It is desirable because of an oft-misunderstood theorem called the efficient market hypothesis, which at its simplest level goes like this: the price of a security like a stock reflects the marketxe2x80x99s consensus of how much that security is worth. That means that if you, retail investor, try to pick stocks to try to outperform the market, you are making a bet that you are better able to understand the trajectory of that stock than the collective knowledge of everyone else who is also trying to do the same thing. That you would be correct in this bet is highly unlikely, and it is highly unlikely for every other individual actor as well.It is so unlikely that you know better than the market that full-time, professional investors who spend their lives trying to know better show over and over that they are incapable of doing it. When over 90% of actively managed funds underperform the S&P 500 (net of fees) over a 15-year period, it is easy to see why the new behemoth in terms of assets under management is original index fund popularizer The Vanguard Group (disclaimer: I have a Vanguard Roth IRA account). Vanguardxe2x80x99s strategy is very simple: instead of charging you through the nose to pay people to pick stocks that mostly do worse than just buying all of them, it charges at cost to buy all of them.And of course, while index funds outperform people like the hedge funds and mutual funds, retail investors do even worse than the pros, with the retail investors who trade the most frequently doing the worst of all. At a certain point a retail investor making a lot of trades without sophisticated knowledge becomes straight-up gambling, and by definition these people are going to a very disproportionate share of the trades on Robinhood and other platforms. And while a good portion of the reason retail investors perform so poorly is because of the trading fees that Robinhood eliminates, it is still the case that people would be much better off buying an index.                              The Efficient Market Hypothesis (2019, colorized) (from Giphy)So we hit a paradox. Robinhood is unquestionably a leap forward in business; it has leveraged an efficiency to strike at an oligopolistic brokerage cartel that has been charging its customers obscene amounts of money to perform a low-cost service. But this same improvement actually reduces the disincentive to trade, which is something that reams and reams of social science tell us people should not be doing. Robinhoodxe2x80x99s incentive structure is that it wants you to trade on there as much as possible. Real people hurt because of this (personally, a relative of mine lost a great deal of his savings day trading, which caused substantial strain on the family).This is not supposed to happen. It is not supposed to be the case that a market innovation that people want and decide to use over often objectively worse competitors might not lead to an improvement in peoplexe2x80x99s lives. This is not an externality problem of some side effect that people insufficiently factor into their decisions; this is the core product consumption.The case of Robinhood is disturbing because it calls into question the premise of the happiness-enhancing market: that consumers making their own decisions, without the problems of externality or monopoly, will lead to the best outcome. It is hard to confront this problem without going down a slippery slope, and while there are various xe2x80x98nudgesxe2x80x99 and regulations that I would consider to be helpful for this specific situation, I think itxe2x80x99s more interesting to think about how this should push us to adjust our priors with regard to innovation. It suggests that we should be more cautious about whether even objective technological or business improvements translate into improvements in our lives. This does not mean that Robinhood has no use cases! There are all sorts of reasons why someone would want to have a particular security that is not part of an overarching day trading or investment strategy. Ixe2x80x99m impressed with their product, and impressed with the entrepreneurial gumption to take a whack at a powerful industry and refuse to buckle. Robinhood is an example of exactly the sort of thing that economists have in mind of innovative competitors lowering costs for better services and getting rewarded with market share.The problem is that this existing framework of evaluating contributions doesnxe2x80x99t always seem to work.The I In We: this profile of The We Company (you probably know it as WeWork) and its co-founder and CEO, Adam Neumann, drives home that WeWork is a sort of singularity for the ~ cool company ~ ideals and reality of 2019: filled with ostensible social progressivism, WeWorkxe2x80x99s main business objectives are to grow as fast as possible while dodging organized labor, generating a cult of personality around itself, and get some self-dealing on the side. One of the many passages that gave me heartburn:Building community is what WeWork has always promised, and its pitch to large corporations is not just hip design and flexible leasing terms but what WeWork calls its xe2x80x9cWeOS,xe2x80x9d referring to its expertise in helping companies optimize both space and overall culture. (In 2017, McKelvey was named WeWorkxe2x80x99s chief culture officer, and hexe2x80x99s fond of using one of WeWorkxe2x80x99s many internal slogans: xe2x80x9cOperationalize Love.xe2x80x9d)Clarence Thomasxe2x80x99 Counterrevolution: professor and writer Corey Robinxe2x80x99s book, which is based on this article, is coming out soon, and itxe2x80x99s one of the few xe2x80x98actually, everyone has been missing something big/thinking about it all wrongxe2x80x99 takes Ixe2x80x99ve read that not only seemed genuinely argued but convinced me of its correctness. Ultraconservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is most famous for being the only black person on the Court, allegedly sexually harassing Anita Hill, and almost never speaking during oral arguments. Robin does a deep dive into his public statements and opinions and theorizes that Thomas follows a consistent jurisprudence of a strain of pessimistic black nationalism and separatism:Unlike many in the Black Power tradition, or even in the black conservative tradition, Thomas seems never to have developed a political or economic analysis of racism. His is primarily a moral account of racism. Racism is shape-shifting, often hidden; that is its poison. The antidote to racism, the moral answer to it, is race sincerity: being truthful with and to oneself, and seeking truth, in however malignant a form, in and from onexe2x80x99s enemies.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Robinhood and the Limits of Innovation - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk","url":"https://themargins.substack.com/p/robinhood-and-the-limits-of-innovation"}

This week Ixe2x80x99m talking subscription flows.  I got my MBA from INSEAD in 2010. It's a French business school that also has a campus in Singapore. When I tell people this, they often smile with a look that makes it clear they think you went to a sham party school.I didn't enjoy the coursework first few months. We'd discuss business case studies on old French furniture firms or Belgian factory workers on strike. Everything felt way too theoretical. Until the Netflix case.First, a quick primer on business school case studies. They give you background on a company, and then usually present a strategic crossroads, a big corporate decision to be made. As a class, you all discuss together, sometimes even role-playing characters. It's a really fun way to learn.The Netflix case was primarily about how the company's DVD-in-the-mail business was very strong, but \"a new challenge was on the horizon: video-on-demand. How should Netflix respond?\" It's pretty cool that in 2009 (when the case was written), a couple of Harvard Business School professors understood the significance of what would end up one of the most important business decisions of the decade. Netflix clearly got things right.Now, I say what's next with a hint of vulnerability, but if the stuff you thought a decade ago doesn't make you feel stupid, then you ain't learning. And you're all Margins readers, so you're like family.Right before I left the U.S. to move abroad, one of the items on my to-do list was to cancel Netflix. I prepared myself for the misery of sitting on hold and being up-sold by some pushy customer service rep. Magically, with two clicks the cancellation was complete. I had never seen anything like it.When we were discussing the case study a detail that jumped out was that, as part of Netflix's customer obsession, they made a very purposeful decision to allow for online-only cancellations.I admit it. It blew my mind that this was a very conscious, courageous decision. That a \"little\" detail like this was the result of a combination of business people and technologists coming together to take a chance felt profound (I cringe, but really, it felt like that). I was a longtime gadget-obsessive, but I was utterly product-illiterate. Hey, I was coming from finance.It was the first time I thought about what a good subscription process looks like.Fast forward to late 2014. We were starting to build out our personalized news app Informerly, and a friend introduced us to this hip new chat product called Slack.Having worked at the Financial Times, I had become reasonably well-versed with the ins and outs of subscription management and on one of our first Slack bills I was absolutely shocked to see something:This was the most gangster subscription management move I could imagine. Here was a relatively new startup that was so confident in its ability to deliver value, they gave you money back for users who didn't use it. The subscription economy often is run on the hope that you forget you're paying, or by locking you in with onerous, opaque contracts, yet Slack was so confident, they, I repeat, gave you money back for users who didn't use it.55 bills later, I basically live on the platform. If you're looking to build customer loyalty and show supreme product swagger, take a look again at that email above. This is what an incredible subscription user experience (SX? SUX? Let's go with SX) looks like, and SX is going to become an increasingly important part of so many different types of digital businesses. Itxe2x80x99s time to start thinking about how we collectively get it right.Fun fact: I just learned Slack is an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge (and itxe2x80x99s original name was Linefeed).eMarketer has some good stats on the rise of subscription-based businesses:On average, US consumers subscribe to three subscription services, up from 2.4 services five years prior.34% of US respondents said they would use more subscription services within two yearsxe2x80xa6.and globally:It's gonna be video (Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, Qiubi), audio (Spotify, Apple Music,  Luminary), fashion (Amazon Wardrobe, Trunk Club, Stitch Fix), food (meal delivery), and regular-life SaaS (iCloud storage). It might even be health care (personalized vitamins, PillPack), and I'm sure I'm missing other things. I still shudder at Scott Galloway's predictions about Amazon and predictive commerce. Our lives will be increasingly subscription-ified. So can we all demand that there are some basic industry standards around subscription processes?I get this stuff is hard. At the FT, I saw how the media subscription sausage was made at relative scale. At Informerly, we tried launching a subscription business and just getting basic infrastructure in place sucked in 2015. Our actual product was never going to cut it, but setting up user communication flows, allowing for subscription management, and the dreaded dealing with expired credit cards were all miserable. Even when people wanted to pay us, it wasnxe2x80x99t always easy. Itxe2x80x99s incredibly heartening that platforms like the one Ixe2x80x99m writing on are working to make this a bit easier.Fun fact: The email flow you set up to remind people to update an expired credit card is a Dunning Email, which \"comes from the 17th century verb dun, meaning to demand payment of a debt.\"But there's still a long way to go. The Wall Street Journal, still, requires you to call in as a digital subscriber. On a phone. In 2019.If the economy will be subscription-ified, the mentality needs to move more towards Netflix/Slack and less negative option billing (or duplicity-as-a-service). Remember those 8 CDs for a penny deals? The AV Club interviewed former Columbia House employees (including Sasha-Frere Jones) on how it portended the internet subscription economy:CW: The whole business was premised on this concept called negative option. Which just sounds so creepy and draconian and weird, but the idea that if you donxe2x80x99t say no, wexe2x80x99re going to send you shit. Itxe2x80x99s going to fill your mailbox, and wexe2x80x99re going to keep sending it unless you panic and beat us back. That was how the money was getting generated.SFJ: Most times when youxe2x80x99re trying to get somebody to buy something, you are actively trying to get them to go and buy the thing, even if now itxe2x80x99s clicking or subscribing and subscription. Columbia House had this brilliant, perverse method which was [that] you sign up and then all you have to do is tell us not to send you things, and if you donxe2x80x99t remember that, we are going to sell you something and you have to pay for. And enough people will like that? Okay. And it was a profitable business. Could you ever get anyone to do that again?PO: You can get a free trial of software, and if you donxe2x80x99t deal with turning it off, youxe2x80x99re going to get billed for $49. Again, all these things are precursors to how business is being done on the internet.Apple shouldxe2x80x99ve been the one moving us in the right direction, but the fact it takes until iOS 13 to give you a heads-up if you're deleting an app that you have a paid subscription for means we still have a long way to go (shouldnxe2x80x99t that automatically cancel your subscription?). No one is taking the lead.June 18th 2019The system is still built around passive behaviors rather than active ones. Everyone hopes you forget rather than remember. A few items on my Subscription Experience wishlist:Getting a notification that a bill is coming soon as opposed to after it's been paid.A very clear App Store/Google Play dashboard that tells you exactly what you'll be spending a month. Your credit card company helping you manage these things. I know there are tools like Trim and Truebill, but this should not be about 3rd parties cleaning up the mess.One-click cancellations, where the service retains your data to allow for a one-click re-subscription (unless you specify you want your data permanently deleted).Free trials without credit cards up front, or where you have to specifically opt-in to trigger the initial subscription payment. I understand the list above is about as likely to become a reality as Vox Media moving to Vimeo. I know all those request would increase churn, and no one player would be able to compete if theyxe2x80x99re the only ones (unless youxe2x80x99re Slack). But the point is, to make this whole subscription thing work at cultural scale, we need to collectively make consumers feel positive and safe about subscriptions, not stressed. Make it more Slack-ish and less gym membership-ish.#HappySlackIPOThat MBA program ended up being an incredible experience. INSEAD has a very global student body, and I'll never forget, right after that Netflix case discussion, a Pakistani classmate asked me why anyone would bother with DVDs by mail, and not just buy them \"from someone on the street, cheaper\". He's currently an executive at Careem, which just sold to Uber for $3 billion, so I guess he figured out how to adapt Western models into emerging markets.And my co-host Can is currently finishing up his MBA.xe2x80xa6.at INSEAD. Any readers interested in applying let us know. It's a great program.Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2019 - Key Findings: This report covers the idea of subscription fatigue relevant to news: Even in countries with higher levels of payment, the vast majority only have ONE online subscription xe2x80x93 suggesting that xe2x80x98winner takes all dynamicsxe2x80x99 are likely to be important. One encouraging development though is that most payments are now xe2x80x98ongoingxe2x80x99, rather than one-offs.In some countries, subscription fatigue may also be setting in, with the majority preferring to spend their limited budget on entertainment (Netflix/Spotify) rather than news. With many seeing news as a xe2x80x98chorexe2x80x99, publishers may struggle to substantially increase the market for high-priced xe2x80x98single titlexe2x80x99 subscriptions. As more publishers launch pay models, over two-thirds (70%) of our sample in Norway and half (50%) in the United States now come across one or more barriers each week when trying to read online news.How Columbia House sold 12 CDs for as little as a penny: The AV Club piece linked above is more on the cultural history of these \"clubs\". This Business Insider piece is a good quick  look at how they made money. One incredible detail:Larry: They would license the actual master tapes and the production files for the physical media from the major music companies. And they would be able to manufacture these records at a cost of about $1.50 or so each. In many cases, inferior pressings on vinyl and CD and you wouldn't get maybe the full lyrics and you wouldn't get the nice inserts and stuff and even the little booklets that were included in the CD were not quite as nice as the ones that you would get in the store very often.Matt: By pressing their own albums, the clubs were able to make about $5 to $6 on each unit they actually sold. Even accounting for all the free albums they sent out.If you made it this far, please enjoy this Columbia House CD club commercial.

Can here. Today we talk software and maps.We talked about the 2019 WWD last week. Yet, it was such a densely packed presentation, it is worth pulling out a few more threads. During the presentation and the Apple pressers afterwards, one thing that came to my attention is how Apple has redesigned its Maps app again.If that phrase sound familiar, it is because I think this is the second time Apple is announcing itxe2x80x99s built the map experience from the ground up, after its initial less-than-stellar lunch. This time, Apple says, its maps are even better. Now therexe2x80x99s Applexe2x80x99s version of Street View which is sleeker. The maps have more detail. It all sounds good, but I do worry if Apple really has what it takes to develop this type of software, and more importantly the infrastructure behind it, in a way that can compete with Google.Tech companies like Apple are giant behemoths and the way software is developed does affect the kind of software that comes out the door. We talked about this a bit in the context of Service Oriented Architecture Amazon had followed for years, and how it enabled them to build AWS. But therexe2x80x99s more to it, so letxe2x80x99s discuss two different ways.You can divide the ways you develop and launch big software products into two. The first is one is basically how you think youxe2x80x99d develop and launch software; talk to some people who you think will use your software, collect those requirements into a document. Then you talk to your software people, tell them what needs to be done, they argue with you a bit why itxe2x80x99s so hard to do X and Y, but eventually people agree on a specification. Then, the software people go and do their thing for a few weeks (months, years, whatever) and you have software ready to launch.This approach is called waterfall where there are sequential steps (requirements gathering, planning, development, testing) and your software falls from step to step.Of course, this approach has its problems, largely being that you do really not know how your users are going to use (and equally important, abuse) your software before it is delivered in their hands. The moment people start interacting with it, they will realize their most requested feature is pointless, but if you could do this other thing, theyxe2x80x99d happily pay double.Then, you can adopt a more iterative approach where the sequential steps are turned into smaller cycles. Instead of developing a giant specification that no one fully agreed on (but rather, gave up discussing on in reality), you develop something and put it in front of people. They tinker with it a bit, and see what they like and they donxe2x80x99t. You then take this feedback to your team, and they tinker a bit more, then it goes.This approach is called agile and has been the more common approach to software development lately. The main idea is your iterative cycles are much, much smaller. Ideally weeks or days instead of the months or years in the waterfall mode.There are of course some costs to this model. The obvious one is, therexe2x80x99s a ton more management you need to do, constantly collecting and collating feedback from your users and relaying it to your developers. Your software people need to be more in contact with the users, which they may or may not like. You also need to educate your users a bit too; they need to be OK with their products being constantly in flux, with things coming and going at times. The much maligned Move Fast and Break Things slogan is a good way to summarize this model.In the Software Eats the World of online, most stuff gets built with an agile model now. There are some baseline requirements, of course, that every agile product needs to cover. For a consumer product, for example, you need to build some account management things, and for enterprise software there are regulations and standards you have to adhere to no matter what. Yet, the bigger bulk of the value add is slowly moving to the agile-y developed part.Agile is still mostly about developing the said software, but you can also see how the delivery methods does play into it. In the waterfall world, the feedback came much later, so it didnxe2x80x99t matter if the software was shrink-wrap software or was downloaded. In the Agile world, however, you need the delivery and the feedback as soon as possible. In fact, if you could skip the delivery step altogether and immediately onboard your customers on to the new version, thatxe2x80x99d tighten the loop even further.For Google, this method of developing and delivering software is ingrained in their culture. In fact, the company was so adamant in rationalizing the agile process and feedback collection, that at some point itxe2x80x99d famously try testing 41 shades of blue. If your software is essentially a web app thatxe2x80x99s accessed by thin clients (like web browsers), you can skip the feedback part entirely and just throw out automatically generated different versions of the same thing and see what sticks. Thatxe2x80x99s partly crazy, but really, why not?Apple, on the other hand, has the DNA of delivering software in yearly cycles that generally correspond to their hardware launches. Every June, you get a sneak peek at the new stuff, and by September you can put in your phone along with the new hardware to go with it.Now, the company has been working to make development of its new apps decoupled from OS updates, but you can still see the organizational culture is much, much different than Google.This brings us back to Apple Maps. Now, itxe2x80x99s true that on iOS that Apple Maps has a larger market share, but that's mostly a function of immutable defaults. Yet, youxe2x80x99d be hard pressed to find anyone who finds Applexe2x80x99s product to be as good as Google Maps. The fact that Apple itself had to apologize and tell people that Google Maps would soon be coming only speaks to the companyxe2x80x99s initial confidence in its product, at least initially.Itxe2x80x99s hard to tell whether Apple Maps is as good as Google Maps now. For some use cases, it probably is. But, speaking from experience and some data I had seen when I was at Uber, when it comes to rigorous users, Apple Maps simply doesnxe2x80x99t cut it. My personal experience echoes the same; every city I travel in I make a small concerted effort to switch to Apple Maps first but then soon give up switch to Google Maps. Sometimes it is because Apple Maps doesnxe2x80x99t have transit information, and sometimes its location database is simply lacking in quality.I am aware I am being a bit unfair to Apple here, and mixing software development practices (waterfall vs. agile) with whatxe2x80x99s essentially building a big database that you need to update. But Ixe2x80x99d argue, the culture that surrounds software development permeates into how the said database that supports that product is maintained too.Moreover, Itxe2x80x99s true Google had a huge headstart in building maps compared to Apple. There is some diseconomies of scale here, no matter how hard you try, you just need to spend a bunch of time building a ton of stuff before you get to something usable. In addition, Google Maps being a default on Android and its relatively generous attitude to data collection does help Google in ways that Apple will not even try. There could be some smart tricks you can do here with anonymization, but I doubt if theyxe2x80x99d ever get you the fidelity of data youxe2x80x99d get from simply tracking your usersxe2x80x99 every more forever.Apple will of course keep updating its location database in the server every day, and its transit database will better too. Yet, looking at what Apple has demoed at WWDC and how it is presented, I canxe2x80x99t help but notice that the Cupertino company still hasnxe2x80x99t fully came to appreciate how people came to expect their products to get better every day, not every year. This is especially key for something like maps, where the info becomes stale the moment you put in the database.Former Apple employee Justin Oxe2x80x99Beirne has written many in-depth comparisons of Apple and Google Maps. One of his concerns, in his latest essay was whether Apple was too focused on shapes, which are pleasing, and Google on information, which is useful. I think that comparison does speak to what different things are important to each company. But I also think as important as the priorities is how the work gets done, and how it affects the outcome. Apple has its task set out for it.The day we discovered our parents were Russian spies: Reading about spycraft is always fun. But then you realize, spies are people too. They have lives outside of work, friends, families, and sometimes, kids. This is a fascinating story about two Canadian kids who, one day, learn that their parents are actually Russian spies and have their entire lives taken away from them. If youxe2x80x99ve watched the famous TV show Americans, this is the story it is loosely based on:The programme was the only one of its kind in international espionage. (Many assumed it had been stopped, until the 2010 FBI swoop.) Many intelligence agencies use agents operating without diplomatic cover; some have recruited second-generation immigrants already living abroad, but the Russians have been the only ones to train agents to pretend to be foreigners. Canada was a common place for the illegals to go, to build up their xe2x80x9clegendxe2x80x9d of being an ordinary western citizen before being deployed to target countries, often the US or BritainWhat I Learned Writing a Book: My twice-manager and long-time friend Will Larsonxe2x80x99s book, An Elegant Puzzle is finally out. Will is a compassionate manager first, but also a very analytical thinker, who loves analyzing the human and systemic aspects of software development.

And in the mean time, here is Will about the process of writing a book.There is this sort of classic bind in life that sometimes your biggest opportunities arrive when youxe2x80x99re least equipped to take advantage.

many contemporary databases donxe2x80x99t even have a way to express this constraint;CHECK definition is parsed and ignored by MySQL, which is one of the widely-used traditional relational databases;  it is true even for the current version 8.0;CHECK only works for the values from the single row of a single table.   So, even if we try to define a CHECK constraint for the value of arrivals.has_symptoms, there is no obvious way to count the number of corresponding rows in the arrival_symptoms;In principle, you can use something like a stored procedure that is going to receive the values from the current row and then it is able to query other tables.  Postgres seems to allow this, but it has some suspicious wording in the documentation: PostgreSQL assumes that CHECK constraints' conditions are immutable, that is, they will always give the same result for the same input row. This assumption is what justifies examining CHECK constraints only when rows are inserted or updated, and not at other times. (The warning above about not referencing other table data is really a special case of this restriction.)Ugh, Ixe2x80x99m not sure how to interpret this.  I read it like this: PostgreSQL reserves the right to memoize the constraint check for the given values of row, and not to re-calculate them even if the other tables are updated in a different transaction.  So you could have a classic time-of-check-to-time-of-use race condition that can lead to the incorrect data.Finally, CHECK constraints only work for inserting and updating rows, not for deleting.  So itxe2x80x99s possible to delete all the rows from arrival_symptoms and, again, corrupt the data.Overall our approach in this substack is that we keep in mind the most non-trivial case.  For example, both our tables could be in different databases or maybe even use the different server implementations.  So we cannot ever hope to be able to control the data that way, we need to find some other way.Okay, the next thing that comes to mind is user-defined triggers.  Theyxe2x80x99re much better in a sense that you can make them validate all the data in a way that we expect, and all cases of incorrect data would be prevented (or shall we say: xe2x80x9conly the correct data is going to be allowedxe2x80x9d?).  However, there are still a number of issues that we need to be aware of.First, itxe2x80x99s obvious that our database server actually must support triggers.Second, as we mentioned in the previous section, our tables could be in different databases (or database schemas), or even in different database server implementations.Third, we would need to pay quite a lot of attention to the deployment of those triggers across our fleet, and to the question of change management.  Triggers are code, and code needs to be version-controlled.  You must be able to deploy the change, and to roll it back in case of problems.  Typical database migration management tools focus on changing the structure of the tables, but updating the triggers is a very much different task.  Also, in typical distributed database installation there will always be instances that are not available at the moment, due to networking or hardware failures, so we need to properly prepare them when theyxe2x80x99re back online.  This is not easy, and a failed state could be tricky to detect and fix.Finally, there is an interesting concern regarding the performance.  Most of the time our writes are just going to be correct.  We would always have that nagging feeling that wexe2x80x99re wasting resources on doing the unnecessary queries and computation.  Of course, correct is more important than fast (because wexe2x80x99re concerned about primary data here), but maybe there are ways to have both?There is a principle of a single source of truth: every piece of data must be stored in a known location, and only once.  So if you want to know its value you have to consult the source of truth.To write structured data values such as either/or data, we can define a single way of truth: create a single piece of code that writes out a value.  It would be a function that receives an argument of either/or data type, validated by a compiler, or just by the runtime assertions, carefully tested.  It needs to update all the tables that participate in storing all possible values of that type.  It can change any value to any other value (so for example it can change HasSymptoms (symptoms: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d]) to  HasNoSymptoms (pcr_test_result: false)).  (You will also need to implement adding and deleting values of this data).After that, do not allow any other way to change this data in your codebase.   This of course requires some control over your code and over your system.  If you have some legacy code paths that are able to arbitrarily change the data by directly updating tables (even if they try to preserve correctness), you will sooner or later have to deal with incorrect data, see the next section.The code that implements this write needs to set all the fields and tables to the known state.  The fields that are allowed within the branch will be set to the provided data values, all the other fields need to be reset to an initial state (such as NULL).For example, setting the value to HasSymptoms (symptoms: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d]) for id=123456 would require the following SQL operators:Resetting this value to HasNoSymptoms (pcr_test_result: false):In this example we assume the transactional database, and we update the value inside a transaction.  If we have more than one database, itxe2x80x99s not possible to reach the atomicity, so we would just need to accept that our system does not provide this guarantee, and design the rest of the code accordingly.Speaking of transactions: itxe2x80x99s important that all the tables are updated in the same order for all updates.  So, in our examples we update all of the xe2x80x9carrivalsxe2x80x9d table, then we update all of the xe2x80x9carrival_symptomsxe2x80x9d table.  This approach will prevent a lot of deadlocks.  Fortunately, this requirement is easy to implement.It makes sense to always be prepared to handle the incorrect data.  You would either have it because of the legacy code that updates the tables directly, or you will eventually have bugs that will slip a number of incorrect values in your database anyway.  Most probably, the bugs will manifest when the specification of the either/or type is going to be extended or reduced, thus the code will have to be changed.  No matter how much we test the code, the question is not if, the question is when.So, we did a manual query to investigate the complaint from the user, and we see the rows that do not make sense together.  From practical point of view we can:treat the data in a conservative way, for example assume that all incorrect data is treated as the xe2x80x9cmore dangerousxe2x80x9d case;we can just remove the incorrect data values if itxe2x80x99s not too important; also, we can re-request the human processing of this data, if there is a way to reprocess it and if it makes a business sense;if the data was broken because of the code change, we can try and find a logic behind the bug, and maybe recover the incorrect values into correct values;if we have some kind of incoming stream of data then we can just reprocess that stream if it still has the original data change requests;we may extend the specification of our data values to incorporate the incorrect combinations and then deal with those combinations in the code, for example:tThis will allow us to work with that kind of data in a more structured way, hopefully preventing further bugs.  Just donxe2x80x99t forget to remove the temporary branch when the data issue is fixed.Okay, this issue is the longest so far.  I knew that this topic was not going to let us go so easily.   I really want to talk about something else next time, maybe about game theory in database modeling.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here

We can find interesting parallels between this process and the process of data modeling.NB: the field of type checking is extremely complicated and normally requires a lot of precision in reasoning.  However, our real goal here is to establish the idea of erasure in database modeling.  We use type erasure just to illustrate that concept.Wexe2x80x99re going to use JavaScript as example.  Thankfully, the most trivial examples are enough for our purpose, so the following text requires zero experience with JavaScript. JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language.  There is also a more advanced extension of JavaScript called TypeScript.  TypeScript is a statically typed programming language.  Static type-checking helps the compiler to find many categories of bugs in our code.  Letxe2x80x99s write a trivial function in TypeScript that calculates the sum of array elements:The first line is the most important for our discussion.  It declares that the function takes an array of numbers (the xe2x80x9c: number[]xe2x80x9d part) and it returns a number.  With the help of type declarations the compiler is able to find many different bugs in our code.   For example, if we accidentally use some function that is supposed to work with text strings and not with numbers, the compiler will complain and refuse to compile this program.The funny thing about TypeScript is that if you delete all the type declarations, what is left would be valid code in JavaScript:It is a perfectly valid program, and if you did not use TypeScript, you could write exactly this in JavaScript and it would be correct code.  Thousands of people write in JavaScript every day.So, TypeScript programs could be converted to JavaScript by removing the type declaration: that is, by type erasure.  Your browser could not execute the TypeScript program directly, so it needs this sort of preprocessing.  Or, you could write a program directly in JavaScript and then run it in the browser directly.So, why do we need TypeScript?  Because when we change something in our program we could make a mistake.  TypeScript compiler then would be able to catch some of those mistakes because the type declarations are still there.If you change JavaScript code, those mistakes could only be found by other means: automated and manual testing, thinking hard, reviewing code, or running your code in production and waiting for complaints from users.   There is nothing wrong with all those approaches, really: your other engineering practices might help you mitigate the consequences of potential errors.If we would lose the original TypeScript source of this program, we could continue changing the JavaScript code directly, just with less help from the compiler and with all associated risks in understanding the original code.So, we have the following hierarchy: program.ts -> program.js.Letxe2x80x99s draw the parallels with the database.Often we think about database schemas in terms of tables, fields, primary keys, normal forms etc.  Many of us learned this approach when we were learning database programming.  But there is certainly a level above this one.  We can see that because there is more than one way to represent many data structures via tables.We saw that in the previous posts: you can put a xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d attribute either in the main table, in the side table or in the per-attribute table.  However, our pseudo-code higher-level representation (logical schema) stays the same:The number of possible logical schemas is less than the number of possible physical tables schemas, as we saw above: there are three physical schemas for one logical schema, and thatxe2x80x99s only for one of the concerns of physical representation.There is a parallel with the type erasure example: the number of possible TypeScript programs is less than the number of possible JavaScript programs.  First, we can write JavaScript programs with bugs that would have been caught by the TypeScript compiler, and those programs would be valid (albeit buggy) programs in JavaScript.  Second, the TypeScript compiler can reorganize the code in different ways for the sake of optimization, so the same function can be represented in JavaScript in many ways, depending on our optimization needs.Another parallel is that often you do not have access to the logical schema of your database: you only have the physical table schema, fields, primary keys and indexes. And you could go quite a long way if you just work at this level: adding or removing a field, adding or removing a table, etc.  Thousands of people execute SQL ALTER operators every day, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that!Of course there is a reason, an idea behind every physical schema.  It may not be explicitly documented, but you can gather it from various cues by looking at the structure of the table, at the code that works with those tables, and even at the data that is stored in those tables.  Also, you could read old documentation or talk with people who joined your company before you and remember more history.The same way, if you look at the JavaScript code above, you can quickly assume that this function accepts an array of numbers from various cues: the name of the function is xe2x80x9csumxe2x80x9d, so itxe2x80x99s probably not strings; and the fact that the code uses forEach function suggests that arr is an array (also, the argument name probably means xe2x80x9carrayxe2x80x9d).  But if you had an original TypeScript code you could be absolutely sure, and you wouldnxe2x80x99t have to guess.A lot of database modeling advice on the Internet and elsewhere talks about database normalization as a guiding principle.  But what if normal forms are erasable, too?  In the previous section we made a hypothesis that the level of physical tables may not be the only level to think on about database modeling.   Normal forms though are properties of physical tables: we say that they are in this or that normal form.Does it mean that normal forms do not exist at the level above the physical tables, whatever that level is?If we look at all the tables that we proposed in two previous posts, wexe2x80x99ll see that they are really pretty well normalized!  All of them are at least in third normal form; if we use per-attribute tables they would probably even be in the sixth normal form.  Yet nowhere in this substack did we even mention the normal forms until now.Does it mean that there is a useful higher level of modeling representation where normal forms are not needed?  Or did we actually use the idea of normalization without realizing it?  Or we just got lucky, the same way that you can accidentally write a JavaScript program without bugs?Also, if we think through our either/or example keeping normalization in mind, we would see that normalization does not help us in maintaining our invariant: we want to store either the list of the symptoms in xe2x80x9chave symptomsxe2x80x9d case, or the PCR test results in xe2x80x9cno symptomsxe2x80x9d case, but having both of them or none of them is incorrect.  Table normalization allows us to prevent many data issues, but can it maintain this particular invariant? The answer is not clear.  Are there alternative ways to maintain this invariant?  How are they related to normalization?  Which invariants, generally, can and cannot be maintained by normalization?Oh and by the way: why do we even want to find the logical schema?  Our answer is that reason is that we are guided by the principle of minimality.There are many questions in this section: we have no answers at the moment, really, just a hunch that this may be an interesting direction.But to find some additional arguments, we shall continue our long journey towards database representation of either/or data.  In the next post wexe2x80x99ll discuss how to actually write either/or data values, using the tables that wexe2x80x99ve proposed in the previous posts.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Erasure - Minimal Modeling","url":"https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/erasure"}

Maybe the order in which requirements arrive should not affect the resulting design?  One of our guiding principles is the principle of concatenability, and it seems that it may be manifesting here.Following the xe2x80x9cConcatenability of either/or dataxe2x80x9d post, we introduce the third top-level option: xe2x80x9cExempt from submitting health dataxe2x80x9d.  Thus we have three cases:no symptoms (implemented as has_symptoms=0);has symptoms (implemented as has_symptoms=1);exempt from submitting health data.How can we change our implementation to accommodate the new case?  First thing that comes to mind is, of course: has_symptoms=2, right?First problem with that solution: the name of the field (has_symptoms) begins to lose its meaning.  If we would be designing this new structure (including the xe2x80x9cexempt fromxe2x80x9d branch) from scratch, we would most certainly choose a different name for it, right?This is a typical problem in database design: the meaning shifts when requirements change, but the persistent identifiers cannot be easily changed.  Thus the gap appears.  Is there anything that we could do here?  Letxe2x80x99s make another mental note.Second problem: the values we have chosen (zero and one) are very convenient to represent boolean values, and thatxe2x80x99s why we chose them.  Zero means false, one (or even non-zero) means true.  So somewhere in our codebase there are code fragments like xe2x80x9cif (has_symptoms) { xe2x80xa6 }xe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cif (!has_symptoms) { xe2x80xa6 }xe2x80x9d, or maybe even xe2x80x9cif (has_symptoms) { xe2x80xa6 } else { xe2x80xa6 }xe2x80x9d.  If we introduce another possible value, wexe2x80x99re going to break all three fragments.We could adjust our interpretation of this field by treating it as integers.  Then we could semi-mechanically refactor the code to use direct comparisons: xe2x80x9cif (has_symptoms == 1) { xe2x80xa6 }xe2x80x9d, etc.  This is fine, though it feels a little bit too low-level.  Could there be some higher-level treatment of this general problem?  Letxe2x80x99s make another mental note.In practice boolean data type often eventually becomes insufficient and requires the addition of one or more extra cases, like here.  This change is tricky also because booleans are such a nice and natural data type for software development, so by the time this change is needed, your code is full of pretty little statements like above.  I considered tackling this topic in the current issue, but I feel that it deserves its own chapter: treating booleans as a subset of either/or data.Following the xe2x80x9cConcatenability of either/or dataxe2x80x9d post, we now ask what would happen if we decide that we do not need to keep the list of symptoms, just the fact that there are symptoms.  In our current schema the list of symptoms is kept in a separate two-column table,  arrival_symptoms. We could 1) stop writing to it, 2) stop accessing it completely, 3) wait a bit and then drop the table.  The list of symptoms is the personal health data, so we really should think through the entire lifecycle of this data, up to its purging.Our schema handles this case quite cleanly, but letxe2x80x99s revisit some potentially problematic decisions we could have made.  First, itxe2x80x99s tempting to declare that the xe2x80x9chas symptomsxe2x80x9d question could have been reformulated by xe2x80x9care there any rows in the table of symptoms?xe2x80x9d.   That would have created an entanglement between the xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d attribute and the xe2x80x9clist of symptomsxe2x80x9d array-typed attribute.  It would work perfectly, but would require some refactoring during the removal of this data.  Worse, we could decide to implement it by 1) introducing a fake xe2x80x9csymptomxe2x80x9d that exists only to support the existing queries, 2) adding this symptom to every arrival that has any other symptoms and 3) removing all real symptoms. This is interesting.  It looks like there are cases that look like data duplication, but maybe theyxe2x80x99re not.  We could confirm that by the usual trick: imagine what happens if requirements would have arrived in a different order.  First we have a schema that only records the value of a xe2x80x9cI have symptomsxe2x80x9d checkbox; this requires an integer field.  Then, a few weeks later, we decide to also gather the information about symptoms, and we create the two-column table storing this data.  Would we then go and decide to kill the original integer field?  Or would we allow our developers to treat both data sources as equivalent?  This is really a non-trivial topic that we need to investigate.It really seems that there is a little landmine under every tiniest decision.  How do people even have courage to design databases, really?One actionable thing that we got out of this discussion is the following principle: Final design should be the same no matter what was the order of implementing requirements.For now, we have at least four new fractal directions for the future posts:booleans vs either/or/or data;naming and changing of requirements;semantics of NULL values could be ambiguous;more structured and less low-level handling of either/or data.Also, we need to begin discussing how to change the complex values of either/or/or data type.  Basically, which insert/delete/update statements do we need to execute to change from xe2x80x9cI have no symptomsxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9cI have symptoms: cold and temperaturexe2x80x9d?   But before we can talk about that, letxe2x80x99s talk about erasure.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Requirements change: migrating either/or data schema - Minimal Modeling","url":"https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/requirements-change-migrating-eitheror"}

the previous post we started discussing a physical representation of either/or data.  Our first database design is simple and straightforward, but our idea is to explore the design space, so letxe2x80x99s discuss some alternatives.  If youxe2x80x99ve just started reading this series, Ixe2x80x99d suggest you skim the previous issue for the introduction (or even begin from the archives).So, we have the arrivals table, and wexe2x80x99ve added the nullable field has_symptoms.  We did it because the arrivals table maintains primary keys for the passenger arrivals, so adding a field directly to this table seems to be pretty obvious.  But we have two more options:a) create a separate side-table that will store data for this particular use-case (storing the health declaration data);b) create a separate narrow table just to store this particular attribute.There are some downsides to adding more and more fields to any particular table.   If you do that long enough and your business logic is complicated enough, you may end up with a lot of those fields.  Some real-world schemas may reach a few hundred columns in a single table.  First, this is going to be quite hard to understand if youxe2x80x99re new to the code base and to the database, and there is no sufficient documentation.  Many people expect to be able to read the table definition and get at least some sense of its purpose and the meaning of its columns.  If you have 500 lines, just to read them all would require quite some time.Second, in some databases adding a new column to the table may be an expensive operation, and it could require extra disk space.Third, if your database uses row-based storage (as opposed to column-oriented store), the data on the disk is going to become less and less dense.  This may decrease I/O efficiency for queries, including the queries that do not touch the new field at all.   Basically, some queries may change the I/O patterns, and this can lead to noticeable performance degradation.  Database servers go out of their way to mitigate this kind of problems for you, and there is a chance that yours would do a very good job to handle this, but this is still something that we must keep in mind.By the way, wexe2x80x99re going to be talking a lot about pros and cons of different design decisions.  Let us acknowledge from the very beginning that in practice the cons are very rarely the dealbreakers, and pros are very rarely decisive.  Theyxe2x80x99re both just additional weights that can influence the engineering balance.  The only actual deal breakers are usually various compliance requirements, everything else is manageable.Anyway, another option we have is to create a table that would store the data directly related to health declarations.  Letxe2x80x99s call it arrivals_covid, and letxe2x80x99s move the has_symptoms field to it:If we would be working more on that use case, wexe2x80x99d expect to add more fields in this table, up to some reasonable number, maybe half a dozen or a bit more.  The primary key of this table would reference the primary key of the main table, arrivals.id.If our software system uses this approach to data modeling, we probably have a number of such side-tables, roughly corresponding to some area, topic or a project.  Fields in those tables are more or less logically grouped: e.g., you would have fields related to payments, to the personal data, to the administrative stuff, etc.  However, if you think about this, itxe2x80x99s not always clear where exactly each new field would go.Also, almost always your use case would require some data that already exists in a different side-table (or in the main table).  For example, for the purposes of COVID tracking we would most certainly need the information about the country of origin.  It is definitely there, in one of the other tables, together with some other data.  The question is really: are those side-tables a good way of grouping fields or are they just essentially random ad-hoc buckets?  This is a fascinating topic, and wexe2x80x99re going to discuss it some time.What if we store every single attribute in its own table?  That table would be narrow: one field for the primary key and one field for the data value (and maybe a couple of fields for timestamps and such).  After this table is created, its structure would virtually never change after that: any other fields would go to their own tables.So, for this attribute we would have:This kind of table would only have a row if the attribute was set.  This allows us to make the value field (has_symptoms) non-nullable (compare with the side-table schema).  The id field also refers back to the arrivals.id primary key.This approach is interesting, with many strengths:itxe2x80x99s very clear where to put each attribute: in a separate table;the values are stored quite efficiently, particularly because only the set attributes are stored, and we donxe2x80x99t need to track NULL values;the data on the disk is stored densely, so the disk access patterns are favourable;you can create new attributes without affecting any of the previous data: the access patterns do not change;And weaknesses too:this approach is very unfamiliar to people;  itxe2x80x99s an important concern because it encodes some kind of folk knowledge that we must make more explicit;for every attribute value we store a value for the primary key.  For small attributes, such as boolean, it means that instead of roughly 1 byte we would be using roughly 5 or 9 bytes (if our primary key is 32-bit or 64-bit);writing SQL to query such kind of tables could be very tedious, especially manually;execution plans for the queries need to be analyzed and confirmed to be acceptable;(Both lists are far from complete, of course.)Note that almost everything that wexe2x80x99ve discussed so far is not really about either/or data, it could be applied to any kind of attributes, pure or structural.  But wexe2x80x99ve touched on many themes and ideas that need to be discussed separately.  For now Ixe2x80x99m going to wrap up this post, but letxe2x80x99s talk a little bit about naming.Letxe2x80x99s trace how wexe2x80x99ve named our tables in fields in all three approaches.  First we assumed that the table is called arrivals, and the field is called has_symptoms.  Then we created the table called arrivals_covid.  For the third table wexe2x80x99ve chosen the name arrivals_has_covid_symptoms.  I intentionally did not pay a lot of attention to naming, just choosing whatever felt appropriate at the moment.What we can see from those names is the interplay of local context and global context.  Wexe2x80x99re here now today, working on this COVID stuff.  Thatxe2x80x99s why for us the name xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d makes sense: of course we mean xe2x80x9csymptoms of COVID-19xe2x80x9d.  But how would that name sound in a few years?  I donxe2x80x99t want to suggest that there could be another event of a different pandemic with different symptoms, but itxe2x80x99s entirely possible, right?  We would have to be more specific in naming the field then.Also, note that when we lifted the attribute to the global level, the table name immediately became longer: xe2x80x9carrivals_has_covid_symptomsxe2x80x9d.  It would feel strange to have the table called xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d, right?  At the same time it feels perfectly normal to have a field called xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d, because the context is provided by the name of the table, e.g. xe2x80x9carrivals_covidxe2x80x9d.Wexe2x80x99ll discuss contextual naming in one of the future posts, too.In the next installment wexe2x80x99re going to discuss extending and reducing the physical schema for either/or data, based on some insight garnered from the discussion in the xe2x80x9cConcatenability of either/or dataxe2x80x9d.For your security, we need to

When the pandemic started, we needed to add the health declaration as defined above.  But there are already many arrivals in our database that happened before the pandemic!  Also, there could be very real situations when the declaration was not submitted: for example, the landing passenger was physically unable to do so due to illness, or they did not cooperate with the law.  So, we must clearly distinguish between the attributes that were set to some value, and attributes that just were not set.  (Roughly speaking, this is what NULL would do for simpler attributes).We can imagine that the main table for arrivals would probably be called arrivals.  It has a primary key, called arrivals.id.  There are probably many other fields in this table.We already did a useful preliminary modeling exercise in the xe2x80x9cConcatenability of either/or dataxe2x80x9d post. We discussed there how to represent this data in JSON-like structure, and we considered the following encoding:{xe2x80x9chas_no_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {} } for xe2x80x9cdeclared no symptomsxe2x80x9d case;{xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d]}} for xe2x80x9cdeclared symptomsxe2x80x9d case;But letxe2x80x99s just show the prototype tables (in pseudo-SQL):In the beginning we need to add several rows to the symptoms table, such as:Those symptom IDs would be used later.We have three main scenarios: I) the attribute has not been set; II) declaration was submitted: no symptoms; III) declaration was submitted: has coughing and temperature.   Letxe2x80x99s see the data that would be added to the tables in each scenario (the ID of our arrival would be 123456).I. The attribute has not been set:The other table, arrival_symptoms, has no new rows.II. Declaration was submitted: no symptomsThe other table, arrival_symptoms, again has no new rows.   We represent the boolean false value as zero here.III.

Leave a commentOf course, the idea of a pair could be extended to 3 or more values, for example the dimensions of a container: (width, height, depth).  This kind of abstract fixed list of values is called tuple.8/ Either/or/or types are the topic of our current investigation.  In some programming languages they are called algebraic types.  Also, when you hear the term xe2x80x9cpattern matchingxe2x80x9d, it very often means dealing with either/or/or types.  There are many different syntaxes for representing this kind of data, so letxe2x80x99s use some nondescript pseudo-syntax.Suppose that we want to ask our hotel guests how they would rate our breakfast, on a scale of 1 to 5.  However, some guests did not have breakfast at all, for one of many reasons, and wexe2x80x99d like to know the reason, too.  Also, itxe2x80x99s possible that some people just did not bother to fill in our survey at all, so we must record this fact too, so that our statistics is not skewed.If the user rated our breakfast with 4 stars then the value of breakfast_survey_response would be RatedBreakfast (rating: 4).  If the user did not have breakfast because it was too early, the response is DidNotHaveBreakfast (reason: too_early).  If the user ignored the survey, the response would be DidNotFillSurvey ().In one of the previous posts wexe2x80x99ve discussed a somewhat similar representation of this data in JSON: https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/database-constraints-pt-ii.How could we store all of this data in our relational database?  There are many possible ways to do that, with their own pros and cons in different contexts.  This is going to be the topic of the next weekxe2x80x99s post.Letxe2x80x99s briefly list some additional topics that would be discussed in this substack in the future.  All of those concepts are deeply structural, but they are so important and/or complicated that they deserve their own post or maybe even a number of posts.  Subscribe below to receive regular email updates on database modeling from us.9/ Ids of different entities could be integers, strings, or even composite values such as pairs.   Ids roughly correspond to the idea of a primary key, if youxe2x80x99re coming from the relational background.10/ Counts are a special kind of numeric value.  Counts appear in some contexts, mostly as the secondary data, so wexe2x80x99d like to kind of single them out.  For example, we could count a number of logins made by the user, or the number of comments that they have left.  Treating those counts is an interesting topic.11/ Addresses and names.  There is a rich programming folklore about handling (and mishandling) this kind of data. This topic certainly deserves a comprehensive discussion, because addresses and names are encountered everywhere in various databases.12/ NULLs could technically be considered a kind of either/or value with a special handling by almost all databases.  NULLs are a topic of endless debates since the dawn of time of database processing.  Wexe2x80x99re not sure if we could contribute anything here, but this theme simply cannot be avoided.13/ JSON data type and its subsets like arrays are now a feature of most databases. This soft-schema technique is important but it could be a double-edged sword, so we must discuss it too.14/ Polymorphic associations arise when we want to treat different things in the same way. For example, if we sell books, music and accessories on the same e-commerce website, those three things will have some common attributes (such as price), and specific attributes (only the book has the number of pages).  Dealing with this kind of data is very common, and just as common are confused questions about its optimal modeling.15/ Link types deal with things like xe2x80x9cUser rates Moviexe2x80x9d.  This is one of the fundamental concepts in our modeling approach, and there are some open questions about how to handle this kind of relationship.16/ Finally, what is the type of entity together with its attributes?  Like, if we have a User entity with age, name, login name, avatar and password: what type is it?  Will this type change if we add more attributes?  Does it even have the single type?  Does it even have a type at all?Next week: physical representation of either/or data.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.15: hypermedia-orientation (hypermedia-oriented design; read \"modeling hypermedia-based communication\") with a domain-driven design infrastructure (see microservices.io and a node js lib called CASL)No posts","title":"Structural and pure attributes - Minimal Modeling","url":"https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/structural-and-pure-attributes"}

  Write down a question mark.xe2x80x9cI do have symptomsxe2x80x9d + a list of symptoms: ok, makes sense!xe2x80x9cI do not have symptomsxe2x80x9d + empty list of symptoms: ok, makes sense!xe2x80x9cI do not have symptomsxe2x80x9d + a list of symptoms: what could that possibly mean?  Write down a question mark.What did we learn from this?We proved to ourselves that in our example data really is non-independent (because there are combinations of values that would make the data inconsistent).  We also have two xe2x80x9cwhat could that possibly mean?xe2x80x9d questions.  We may actually find an answer to those questions!  This example is very straightforward, but in other situations itxe2x80x99s possible that there is a valid interpretation for the combination of values.  Just run those questions by the problem domain expert.We now have a common vocabulary that we can use in discussing this data with everyone.We can look for the xe2x80x9cforbiddenxe2x80x9d combinations of values in the actual database, and if we find any, we know that we have a bit of a problem with the data and we can begin looking for solutions.We know how to generate correct and incorrect cases to test how the code handles those kinds of situations.  Also, we can test both the data-fixing and the data validation code.If all the cells would contain xe2x80x9cokxe2x80x9d then we would learn that the data is actually independent.Sometimes you will have question marks not because the data is non-orthogonal, but because a piece of data is derived from another piece of data.  For example, if we store a number of posts submitted by a user as an attribute, and there is a table where posts are stored, those two counts may be out of sync due to a bug or propagation delay.  Wexe2x80x99re going to discuss derived data extensively in later posts.Software developers love inventing clever tricks.  Somebody would have a bright idea on how we could maybe interpret one of those xe2x80x9cforbiddenxe2x80x9d cases that wexe2x80x99ve discovered during the analysis.What if xe2x80x9cI do have symptomsxe2x80x9d + empty list of symptoms could meanxe2x80xa6This is dangerous, do not go that way (at least now).  We are thinking on the logical level currently.  If you need more information then instead of encoding them as a special combination of values, just introduce more attributes, or more relations.  Design those attributes properly, and only then you should be looking for the way to physically encode them in tables and fields of your database.Just a reminder: if you look closely, null references, also known as xe2x80x9cThe billion dollar mistakexe2x80x9d, are the result of this way of thinking.  People tried to find interpretation for a nonsensical case (null pointer, basically), decided that it could mean xe2x80x9cobject was not foundxe2x80x9d, and here we are:In the next installment wexe2x80x99ll talk about data types in database modeling, unless we again have a better idea.  This would be the last step before we would directly tackle the relational modeling of either/or data.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Dependent and independent pieces of data - Minimal Modeling","url":"https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/dependent-and-independent-pieces"}

Second-level object/hash may also contain keys that would store additional data.  We have two cases here, with one branch for each.How could this structure be extended if needed?  For example, requirements could change. Letxe2x80x99s use pseudo-JSON notation:{xe2x80x9chas_no_symptomsxe2x80x9d: { * } };{xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d], * }};We can extend the branches by adding new keys where the asterisks (*) are.  For example, we may decide that we want to store a result of the PCR test in the xe2x80x9chas symptomsxe2x80x9d case:{xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d],xe2x80x9cpcr_test_resultxe2x80x9d: xe2x80x9cnegativexe2x80x9d}};(If we would always require storing PCR test results then it shouldnxe2x80x99t be stored in this branched structure, otherwise it would go against the principle of minimality.  Only the data that belongs only to a specific branch should be under that branch.)It is also possible to add more top-level branches to this structure.  For example, some passengers may be exempt from submitting a health declaration, say because of their diplomatic status.  We can handle this case by adding the third branch:{xe2x80x9cexemptxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9creasonxe2x80x9d: xe2x80x9cdiplomatic_statusxe2x80x9d } }Thus making it an either/or/or/... data.We can also notice that both of the additions that wexe2x80x99ve just discussed are completely incremental.  After we implement the code that sets the new branch or sets the new key in one of the older branches, the existing data does not need to be changed in any way, itxe2x80x99s going to be compatible with the new code.  This is an extremely useful property to have, it would help us a lot during the data migrations.When wexe2x80x99ll be discussing the relational encoding of either/or data, we should strive to achieve and maintain this property!The second phase of concatenability (an idea that was introduced in the previous post) is removing.  As we know, itxe2x80x99s always easier to add something to a computer system than to remove it.Suppose that now we decide that we donxe2x80x99t need the precise information about the symptoms, itxe2x80x99s enough for now to have a yes or no answer.   The up-to-date structure would look like this:{xe2x80x9chas_no_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {} } for xe2x80x9cdeclared no symptomsxe2x80x9d case;{xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9cpcr_test_resultxe2x80x9d: xe2x80x9cnegativexe2x80x9d}} for xe2x80x9cdeclared symptomsxe2x80x9d case;{xe2x80x9cexemptxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9creasonxe2x80x9d: xe2x80x9cdiplomatic_statusxe2x80x9d } } for the xe2x80x9cexemptxe2x80x9d case;(here we removed the xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d key in the second branch).We change the application code that generates this structure, test it and prepare to deploy.  The new rows in our database would no longer have the xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d key, so we also need to make sure that all the code would be ready to handle this situation.  If it is under our control then it would be easier, and would depend only on the maturity of our testing process.The question is, though: what shall we do with the data that is still stored in the existing database records?  If wexe2x80x99re lazy we could just leave it as it is.  The new code will ignore it anyway.Of course, this decision would increase our technical debt.  Letxe2x80x99s try to look at the problem from the points of view of different stakeholders of our database.  What happens if we leave the unused data?From the point of view of a software development manager, it is possible that people who join the team in the future would be slightly confused if they would find older records that contain this data.  They would have to find out if this data is still relevant, if it could be used, if it should be used.  Does it need to be preserved?  Finding out answers to those questions a few years down the road would be a bit of hindrance to the velocity of the development process.From the point of view of database administrators, this data is part of a standard database backup.  Thus, it takes a bit of space in the backup storage, and it takes a bit of time during the backup procedure.From the point of view of storage budgeting, this data takes some storage space.  The important point to understand about space-saving efforts is that wexe2x80x99re interested not in xe2x80x9creducing the space usedxe2x80x9d, but xe2x80x9cincreasing the amount of data stored in the space we havexe2x80x9d.  If we have 100 Gb of data and we saved 5Gb, nobody cares that itxe2x80x99s now only 95Gb.  What is important is that we can now store 5% more data without buying a new hard drive (or extending partition, or paying for more cloud block storage, etc).Some of the data needs to be legally compliant.  This particular example could be said to fall under the xe2x80x9cpersonally identifiable informationxe2x80x9d (PII).  It is possible that we would really prefer to get rid of this kind of data the moment it is no longer needed, so that we would have less potential problems with it in the future.From the point of view of software developers who are busy with changing the code and making sure that it works, removing the data completely would have one additional advantage.  When we remove the data completely, the remaining code that is accidentally still using this data would break sooner.  We will be able to deal with the potential breakage while this change is still fresh in our minds.  Maybe we would even discover that we should roll back the change for now and fix something else before we can try migration again.Data scientists may also discover that the noisy data makes their models less efficient and may really want to have it cleaned to improve the performance of machine learning models etc.  Of course, they would also be particularly affected by the same questions of knowledge management that wexe2x80x99ve discussed in the first bullet point: is this data still relevant?, etc.Wexe2x80x99re going to use this kind of stakeholder analysis when discussing all the modeling decisions that we would need to consider.In the next installment wexe2x80x99ll talk about data types in database modeling.  This would be the last step before we would directly tackle the relational modeling of either/or data.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log

We had to remove many different things on almost all layers of our software system: HTML, JavaScript, the backend language that we use, CSS, plain English text, database tables, Python data processing scripts, Graphite expressions, Swift and Kotlin, etc., etc.Also, wexe2x80x99ve learned quite a bit about our system along the way.  Some pieces of our system were pretty modular: we could remove just a single CSS file xe2x80x9c_bookmarks.cssxe2x80x9d, and, say, a couple of backend modules that clearly have xe2x80x9cbookmarksxe2x80x9d somewhere in the name.  Then we had to remove mentions of those modules, and our software compiled and worked.   Some parts of the system were harder to untangle, for all kinds of reasons.We can now step back and get a birdxe2x80x99s-eye view of all the code that we had to touch: the code that used to comprise the xe2x80x9cBookmarks as a featurexe2x80x9d.   This code is cross-technology (full-stack), so we cannot call it xe2x80x9cBookmarks modulexe2x80x9d, because a module is usually something that lives only in a single technology, such as CSS or Java.  We have to find a word for that.What happened in our codebase is one of the phases of concatenability: removing.Few months later the Mysterious Council appears in the dreams of all vice-presidents simultaneously, apologizes and explains, among other things, that for still vague reasons the concept of a bookmark is no longer forbidden and the company can re-add it to the product if still necessary. Well, bookmarking is a pretty useful feature, so letxe2x80x99s add it to our backlog.We now have a chance to implement bookmarking in a different way, maybe somewhat more modular.  We understand the feature very well, and we better understand the codebase from our previous experience of removing this feature.Basically, this time the code will be more concentrated, and less spread out in unrelated files.  We canxe2x80x99t help but notice that the code will be easier to remove again, if need be (we can no longer discount the chance that the Mysterious Council will change its mind again).This is another phase of concatenability: adding.Itxe2x80x99s always easier to add something to the typical software system than to remove it.  But what if from the start we could maintain awareness that almost everything will eventually need to be removed, and plan accordingly?So, in the future posts wexe2x80x99re going to evaluate every possible database design decision taking into account the idea of concatenability.  Wexe2x80x99ll see that it manifests on every layer: logical database model, physical database model, data itself, secondary data processing, data consumers, database storage technology, server implementations etc.In the previous post we discussed representing either/or data in JSON representation.  This is a small, but very good example that would be helpful to illustrate concatenability.  Letxe2x80x99s discuss it next week.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Concatenability principle - Minimal Modeling","url":"https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/concatenability-principle"}

Thatxe2x80x99s how it was stated:Suppose that we want to register the health declarations of incoming passengers.  They must fill in the form that basically asks:Do you have any symptoms of COVID-19 from the list below?  If no, tick here: [ ]If yes, mark all that apply: [ ] cold symptoms; [ ] coughing; [ ] elevated temperature.So, for each passenger we need to store that they said xe2x80x9cyesxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cnoxe2x80x9d, and if yes, we need to store the list of symptoms.  If they avoided submitting the form we must be able to detect it.  Also, we must make sure that we prevent the incorrect case: both xe2x80x9cnoxe2x80x9d and a list of symptoms, which would be ambiguous.Usually wexe2x80x99re interested in normal relational databases, or something that more or less resembles it.  But letxe2x80x99s try to look at another popular representation: free-form JSON.I donxe2x80x99t really know where wexe2x80x99re going with that, but I have some hope that it could shed some light on the general problem.How do we encode the health declaration of a passenger in JSON format?  The first thing that comes to mind is:{xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: false} for xe2x80x9cdeclared no symptomsxe2x80x9d case;{xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: true, xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d]} for xe2x80x9cdeclared symptomsxe2x80x9d case;One problem with this representation is that it does not prevent us from incorrect data such as {xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: false, xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d]}.Itxe2x80x99s easy to mishandle this piece of data.  If your code checks for xe2x80x98if (data.has_symptoms)xe2x80x99, it will not notice the other key that contains ambiguous value.  Moreover, the structure of JSON does not encourage you to write code to better check both possible cases.Letxe2x80x99s try another approach with the following encodings:{xe2x80x9chas_no_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {} } for xe2x80x9cdeclared no symptomsxe2x80x9d case;{xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d]}} for xe2x80x9cdeclared symptomsxe2x80x9d case;This is interesting.  1/ there are no boolean values here, so there is no way to erroneously encode at least one incorrect representation.  Having boolean values in general is ok, what is problematic is having them as the structural element, distinguishing between the cases.2/ The values that we have for both our top-level keys have the same structure: itxe2x80x99s just the object/hash.  In case of xe2x80x9cno symptomsxe2x80x9d we donxe2x80x99t need additional data, so itxe2x80x99s just the empty hash value: {}.  Otherwise, we have the hash value with the xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d key that contains the list of symptoms.3/ In most languages you can easily write the if-conditions as expected: e.g. xe2x80x98if (data.has_symptoms)xe2x80x99.  But itxe2x80x99s now harder to write the code that accesses the list of symptoms without checking if wexe2x80x99re in the right branch: xe2x80x98data.has_symptoms.symptomsxe2x80x99 will fail if there is no xe2x80x98has_symptomsxe2x80x99 key.4/ Of course, one can imagine the code that still manages to return an incorrect response such as {xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9ccoldxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccoughingxe2x80x9d]}, xe2x80x9chas_no_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {}}. Arguably, this kind of erroneous producer code is harder to write (or, maybe we should say that itxe2x80x99s easier to write the correct producer code).5/ This kind of JSON structure is pretty easy to validate with the help of JSON schema.  You create schemas for both the xe2x80x9cno symptomsxe2x80x9d case and the xe2x80x9chas symptomsxe2x80x9d case and then declare that the valid result is either one or another. You donxe2x80x99t even need a schema here, you can just require that this piece of data has exactly one top-level key.  This is quick and dirty, but may be an efficient solution.  You donxe2x80x99t need to consider boolean values in data to decide if the schema is correct.6/ Having said of all that, we canxe2x80x99t help but notice that even this solution does not prevent us from this, presumably incorrect, encoding: {xe2x80x9chas_symptomsxe2x80x9d: {xe2x80x9csymptomsxe2x80x9d: []}}. Here we have the empty list of symptoms. We had the same issue in our first approach too.  How can we deal with that? There is no clear answer at the moment, but wexe2x80x99ll continue this analysis later.Of course, wexe2x80x99re interested not only in this particular example, but in other data of similar structure: the choice of either/or.   There are many real-world situations that require this, for example:If you calculate numerical expressions, you can get either numeric result (xe2x80x9c2 + 2 = 4xe2x80x9d) or an error (xe2x80x9c2 / 0: division by zero\");We can ask our hotelxe2x80x99s guests: xe2x80x9cOn a scale from 1 to 5, how did you like breakfast?xe2x80x9d  Some people did not have breakfast for some reason, so we need to encode this possibility too.  And then we can go on and ask: xe2x80x9cIf you did not have breakfast, why?xe2x80x9d, and we need to store the responses too (xe2x80x9cleft too earlyxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cdidnxe2x80x99t feel like itxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cspecial dietary requirementsxe2x80x9d, etc.)Also, we still have the original question: how to encodxd0xb5 this kind of data in a relational database.Also, we need to talk about the extensibility of this kind of data schemas, and that would lead us to the idea of concatenability in database schemas.  Letxe2x80x99s discuss it in the next post.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Database constraints, pt.

Nature provides these benefits for free, but we increasingly find ourselves surrounded by urban landscapes devoid of fractals. Incorporating fractals into urban environments can begin providing benefits from a very early age.Sacred Temples and Fractal ArchitectureWhere are some places you see fractal architecture still preserved? Holy places. Places like Hindu Temples, Persian Mosques and Churches. Itxe2x80x99s not just fractal architecture but everything around sacred places really affect the human. Itxe2x80x99s smells, the clothes the priests wear, the furnishings, the symbols, the colors, etc. These ancestral aesthetics work on the human. Take for instance, Montaigne on the use of incense. In contemporary times we call this aroma therapy: January 5th 2021Date IdeaThis year has been tough for people because of the virus and lockdowns. For single people itxe2x80x99s been even tougher because itxe2x80x99s hard to date in this environment. You canxe2x80x99t meetup at a restaurant, bar or cafe. Everything is closed. But maybe thatxe2x80x99s not the worst thing in the world. Try having a walking date. Spot fractal patterns. Feel good because youxe2x80x99re in nature and outside. It spurs creativity, good feeling and maybe good conversations. Many long term relationships are sustained just by having walking around outside together as your cornerstone. Public Housing Today's architecture is \"smooth\", Euclidean, & of low dimensionality. Even low income housing in Ancient Rome (Ostia) had dimensionality, with moldings and no smooth external walls, no angular corners. Compare to contemporary public housing in the BronxEuclidean Geometry So what happened? If we know that fractal architecture is important for mental health. Why arenxe2x80x99t we surrounded by fractal buildings everywhere? Well, therexe2x80x99s a bunch of reasons. Letxe2x80x99s start with euclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry only entered architecture in modern times..causing the ugly non fractal structures we have today. Ancestral architecture did not have Euclidian geometry. It was built on heuristics and knowledge passed down over generations. The Rise of the ArchitectFor most of history, it was well understood that the last thing one needed in an architect was xe2x80x98originalityxe2x80x99 xe2x80x93 no more than one would want originality in a carpenter or a bricklayer. The job of an architect was just to turn out a building roughly like all the other buildings in a district and to do so politely and on time; it was certainly not to express a distinctive personality, emphasise their differences or make a splash. As a result, most districts of most cities looked very alike. You couldnxe2x80x99t really tell who had done what building and it didnxe2x80x99t matter (just as it doesnxe2x80x99t especially matter who baked a loaf of bread). Architecture was beautifully impersonal and repetitive. But in the early 20th century, a troubling idea emerged: that the architect was a distinctive individual, with a unique vision, which needed to be expressed in all its fancifulness in order to appease a restless creative spirit. To ask an architect to fit in with everyone else was as stifling as asking a poet to type out the tax code. It might have been a liberation for certain architects, but society as a whole paid an enormous collective price for this creative release. Suddenly, architects began to compete to create the most outlandish and shocking forms xe2x80x93 as if to prove their distinctiveness and worth. It was well understood that one could make a name for oneself not by turning out dignified and unassuming buildings, but through outrage and peculiarity.Architects started trying to impress other architects. They wanted to win awards. Architecture as ArtArt is interesting and important. But sometime in the 20th century we began treating architecture as art. We separated buildings from their living context, and the results are stark -- and generally ugly and unpleasant. Art has the ability to challenge us and show us different viewpoints. But we donxe2x80x99t need that from architecture. Thatxe2x80x99ll make you depressed or crazy if youxe2x80x99re surrounded by that all day. It gets worse, architecture is too expensive to destroy. So it sits up there. As a monument to a particular fad, or an architects idea he had at one time. Architecture is too important to be Art. Architecture is something much greater. It is an organic form that we are connected to that psychically, physically and emotionally influences us in important ways. If you get some architect who is xe2x80x9cartisticallyxe2x80x9d inclined hexe2x80x99s going to build something that messes with your head. Modern architects play that same game that artists do which means they essentially excuse themselves for constructing alienating places by citing it as a reflection of the inner feeling of the modern person: that of alienation. Hexe2x80x99s trying to make some statement about life and everyone is paying for it. What happens is it exacerbates this feeling. We donxe2x80x99t need a xe2x80x9cmirrorxe2x80x9d. We need fractal architecture. A wholesome places to inhabit and live.  I donxe2x80x99t want to live in a society where I walk by certain places and it gives me the distinct feeling of \"this space is not for you.\"Place-sensitive Architecture.The problem with contemporary architecture is not just de-fractalized architecture, but de-placed architecture. As we have seen with the examples of religious buildings above, cultures throughout the world develop fractal geometry organically, click here for African fractal settlements. Just as with clothes, food, and songs, architecture represents a local culture and settlement. An organic bottom up style of a people and place. Local architecture can help to orient us and connect us to particular places that donxe2x80x99t look like they could be anywhere on earth, one city is built in one sort of stone and the other in another. But modernity introduced glass and steel, out of which large and imposing structures could quickly be formed.The argument once again forgot about human nature. When we say that a building looks like it xe2x80x98could be anywherexe2x80x99, wexe2x80x99re not praising its global ambitions, wexe2x80x99re expressing a longing for a building to remind us of where on earth we are.This could be anywhere nowThis is BolognaIndeed, even the contemporary minimalist ultra modern style doesnxe2x80x99t seem to be from anywhere.

If you consider whatxe2x80x99s the most beloved and popular piece of classical music, you might think of a grand opera cycle from Wagner or an impossible to play concerto from Tchaikovsky.But in reality, itxe2x80x99s the music amateurs would compose and play in the chambers of palaces and humble households for their friends and loved ones.Our need to fill the silence and accompany our dinners and parties with notes is not new. Nowadays, we simply hop on Spotify or YouTube and choose a playlist.In the past, people composed and performed chamber music. The Music of Friends.Any music that can be performed inside a room could be considered part of the chamber music xe2x80x9cgenrexe2x80x9d.The intimate nature of this kind of music was a very needed break from the structural complexity and heaviness of larger ensembles.During the romantic era, the concept of gemxc3xbctlichkeit, coziness and hearth, was pronounced in the homes of central Europe. Music in these rooms were generally smaller than a church or theater. Less volume was required to fill them with sounds, and ensembles tended to be smaller.It allowed for the expression of intimate emotions in a safe space where one can share and experiment.I choose to focus on two string quartets (two violins, viola, and cello) from Schubert and Mendelssohn.Perhaps, there are more characteristic examples of chamber music (like the Dissonance Quartet) but these two compositions are uniquely interestingxe2x80xa6Written during the worst period of Schubertxe2x80x99s life, this is a piece about despair, depression, and mortality. It was published 3 years after Schubertxe2x80x99s death but it was performed behind closed doors, amongst friends.Immediately, youxe2x80x99re bombarded with a triplet motif that will be repeated throughout the piece. Aggressive and relentless.It might seem contradictory to the essence of chamber music but in my opinion, it showcases the fact that the composer feels comfortable expressing his fear of death, through music, for all his friends to witness.The context of death, resurrection, and admittance of mortality is carried to the rest of the movements. Once you finish all four of them , I invite you to check out this version as wellReturning from Leipzig, Mendelssohn finds out his beloved sister Fanny had died. His old, reserved self crumbles. Anger, wrath, and grief paint his last composition. xe2x80x9cA Requiem for Fannyxe2x80x9d.The trembling strings are his boiling rage. At 2:34, the violin jumps out. The composer is crying, an injustice has been made.At 6:03, all sense of composure, both mental and musical, is out of the window. Chaos ensues.Itxe2x80x99s worth highlighting the coda of the whole quartet. Last movement, at 4:34, Mendelsshon is quite literally breaking down. Hexe2x80x99s hearing the news of his sisterxe2x80x99s death and perhaps his ownxe2x80xa6A few months later, he suffers multiple strokes and dies. Even though the context of these 2 compositions might be depressing, remember that the composers freely offered this music to their friends. Like writing a personal letter or telling them a deep secret.This sentiment was abandoned in the early 20th century and chamber music became another structural formula.

But composers still did compose a great deal of music for performance at home by amateurs. In those days, a woman's work was to serve as ornament to her husband, and as such she was required to learn to play an instrument. When you look at some of the pieces composed for such amateur performers, you get an idea of just how high a technical standard was considered  normal at the time!Even political leaders were in on the act. Think, for example, of Haydn's huge number of trios including the baryton, a now-obsolete instrument that his employer was fond of. They're all on YouTube and well worth a listen.Nowadays, when music can be had at the press of a button, few people bother to learn to play an instrument, and few can play particularly well - we're simply too busy to have sufficient time to practice.No posts","title":"Lindy Music #3 - The Lindy Newsletter","url":"https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/lindy-music-3"}

One year is a long time. You start forgetting your past life a little bit after one year. The memories of waking up, walking to the train, packing yourself inside a train car, riding for 30-40 minutes, getting off downtown, walking into the office, sitting down at your desk start fading. That life is hazy now. You can recall it if you try, but itxe2x80x99s not really in your mind anymore. Instead, life is different now. I wake up, make coffee and sit at a desk next to a window with a wonderful view. Life is better. It looks I am not alone in thinking that.January 1st 2021The human tends to get used to things, whether it be your home, your spouse, money in the bank, or clothes. But a view is different. You never get used to a great view. You become familiar but then it still grabs you now and then. Never gets tired. Some people may disagree and say you get used to a view. The xe2x80x9cyou get used to itxe2x80x9d feel is asymmetric xe2x80x94 it is not the same to get used to a cubicle and a beautiful view. but what makes a beautiful view? Nature and nourishment.Weekends During the work week people have a routine. Do they like what they do? Probably not. Itxe2x80x99s the 4HL. They do what they can to keep their job, health, sanity and be back in the office in the morning. But what about when they are temporarily free, what do they do  on the weekend? They go outside. Thatxe2x80x99s what most people do. If they live in a city they go walking in a park. I lived in New York for a few years, the parks were packed on the weekends. Sometimes people go out camping. If they live in the suburbs they develop their garden. This desire to develop onexe2x80x99s natural environment is on full display at the local garden center. You see scores of people come there to spend considerable amounts of time, money, and effort to beautify their surroundings with natural objects. Trees, shrubs, plants, flowers, grass seed, and fertilizer are purchased, transported, and installed because of the high value universally placed to provide pleasure and satisfaction. People are spending a lot of money on their garden or land. In most human environments, ranging from the simple home with its garden to a thriving metropolis, there exist provisions for an explicit natural refuge. The worldwide phenomenon exists of establishing parks, gardens, and protected wilderness because of their physical, psychological, and spiritual benefits. The physical and mental benefits of contact with these explicitly natural environs include rest, relaxation, and restoration from illness; spiritual renewal; contemplation; and self reflection. Trees, bushes, and plants are stress-reducing and restorative. People just want to be immersed in nature. They donxe2x80x99t necessarily even want to be doing any activity, just be immersed. The benefits are obviously mental, but we are learning about the explicit physical benefits as well:The scientist Stephen Wolfram found a curious connection between heart rate and being out in nature.EnvironmentsHumans genetically based tendency toward park-like environments is apparent in landscape design. At Pompeii, the ancient Romans incorporated formal gardens next to most functional structures, and ancient Japanese gardens similarly stress the orderly arrangement of garden elements such as trees, shrubs, open space, and water elements.Contrast nature with the corporate office most people work in: How do you feel when you look at that picture?What about this picture? It doesnxe2x80x99t feel good to look at. It also feels very artificial. The lines are straight. Itxe2x80x99s a construct without jaggedness or wildness. Itxe2x80x99s smooth. It just doesnxe2x80x99t feel good to look at or be in. Why do some designs make us feel good and other designs make us feel tense, stressed or alienated? Why am I most comfortable in a forest, a cave, or a Gaudi building?By studying natural phenomena, we endeavor to reveal hidden laws and truths. Nature  is expressed through inherent order. Fractal geometry is the geometry of the natural world. In the natural world objects aren't squares, boxes, pyramids or cubes. There are few straight lines. Instead we find curves, wrinkles, and broken lines. The concept of fractal geometry argues that nature has a fundamental significance to humans that affects them emotionally, cognitively, and physically. The recognition of naturexe2x80x99s value has been embodied in architectural design throughout the ages. Ancient cultures based their most important structures, temples, on their philosophical relationship with nature. Characteristics of Fractal FormsFractal forms exhibit certain essential qualities that make them unique and pique human interest and appreciation. These qualities are interwoven, reinforcing and supporting each other. Among these qualities are the following:xe2x80xa2 self-similarityxe2x80xa2 holismxe2x80xa2 structurexe2x80xa2 generative qualityxe2x80xa2 dimensionxe2x80xa2 organizational depthxe2x80xa2 recursive/nested qualityxe2x80xa2 geometric diagramIn looking at the natural forms around you, one notes that despite the tangles, twists, and other irregularities, they exhibit patterns whereby one section of the shape looks like other parts of the shape and like the whole. This concept of self-similarity is readily apparent as an extension of the elementary geometric principle of similarity.It is the underlying theme in all fractals, varying to the degree it is exhibited from fractal to fractal. A cauliflower, which is a treasure trove of what one considers self-similarity, is obviously not a group of similitudes but rather a group of affinities that contain the essential organizational structure of the whole and, by definition, the surrounding parts and that give them a little twist, a little bit of a skew. You do not consider the subtle distortion but inherently recognize the interwoven set of relationships of similarity between each part: the sub-subwholes, the subwholes, and the whole.Within each we can see a repetition of shapes. For example, the shape of the smallest branchlet on the fern frond (circled in red) resembles the larger branchwhich in turn resembles the whole frond.This is described as 'self-similar', meaning the shapes are similar to each other even if they are of a different size. This repetition of self-similar shapes is one of the features of fractals and can also be seen in spirals, waves and other patterns. Branching patterns aren't just found in plants, you might find them in waterfalls, rivers and estuaries. Notice how the smaller branches at the lower part of the waterfall look similar to the larger patterns at the topWave-like patterns can be found in the land and the sky as well as in water.Fractals Around YouAt some point of time, when you embrace the principle of self-similarity as a fundamental characteristic of nature, you will reflect on the philosophical implications of this concept. In grasping the element of interconnectedness of nature, it undoubtedly has profound implications on your idea of your relationship with nature and other fellow humans. When you grasp fractal geometry your perception of the natural world will be fundamentally changed. You will look at flowers, trees, clouds, mountains, streams of water, the distribution of stars in a new light. Instead of observing the world with a reductionist viewpoint, where things are separate and distinct, you perceive and understand the world as a resonance of a greater wholeEnd of Part 1For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.The timing of this piece coming to me was eerily good.

I enjoyed this very much. Thank you. Transcendence comes from immersion, downfall comes from escapism- use brought about by a desire to get away from unaesthetic surroundings.Great piece as always Paul.No posts","title":"Fractal Architecture as Therapy (Part 1) - The Lindy Newsletter","url":"https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/fractal-architecture-as-therapy-part"}

Itxe2x80x99s a dangerous game to send out book recs. Itxe2x80x99s not like recommending a song, which if you hate, you only waste a minute, or a movie that takes an hour or two. Books are different. If you  start reading a book and you end up not liking it, it turns you off to reading for awhile. You go do other things. And today, there is no limit to consuming other entertainment choices. However, if the book is good, it has incredible upside. You see the world differently.  Movies, songs and tv shows never do that. They have a bounded ceiling and floor on what they can do for the human. A good book gains over time.John GrayOver the last few decades there has been a movement by thinkers for whom the human race is getting better. They tend to be rational humanists such as Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker and Sam Harris. They argue we are en route to a vastly improved future. Meanwhile, John Gray insists that humanity is not that much different than in the past. Whatxe2x80x99s enjoyable about reading John Gray is that hexe2x80x99s incredibly erudite. His books take you on a road through time, places and thinkers. Itxe2x80x99s a wonderful journey. And his writing is clear and sharp. A lot of the time you read these books by xe2x80x9csocial scientistsxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cphilosophersxe2x80x9d and itxe2x80x99s terrible. You work for a living, You have a 4HL. And someone is going to sit there and ruin your leisure by writing in a terrible style. How awful is that?John Gray doesnxe2x80x99t do that. Once you turn the first page you know your mind is in the hands of an artisan. And itxe2x80x99s a beautiful thing. Ixe2x80x99m going to recommend three books by John Gray that I enjoyed reading. And theyxe2x80x99re not even long. Theyxe2x80x99re all under 200 pages. But each page is alive. A lot of the times you get these xe2x80x9cauthorsxe2x80x9d who want to throw the kitchen sink at you. They write 600 pages out of ego or to impress their academic friends. Meanwhile, you have a job and are getting the downside for this sinister inside game you never knew existed. Not fun. The Soul of the Marionette The Soul of the Marionette argues that human beings are stuck between mechanical motions of the flesh and the freedom of the spirit. He doubts the attainability of progress through knowledge. Gray uses romantic literature and science fiction eclectically in his search for illustrations of how we are deceived we are by notions of freedom. It is not that we are free or not free that is the issue, but that we deceive ourselves with the very question of freedom, perhaps being incapable fo accepting that the universe itself is probably driven by an xe2x80x98underlying chaosxe2x80x99. The practical message could that it is ok to be content to let meaning come and go. Puppets are free of the internal turmoil of choice. Scientific knowledge has now become an unrecognized Gnostic faith for us. Gray asserts: Gray suggests that we are worse off than marionettes, because we tend to resist the pulling of our strings, to fight back for illusory freedom and meaning. The ways we find this are numerous, but all xe2x80x93 to Grayxe2x80x99s way of thinking xe2x80x93 share an escapist mindsetOur desire to avoid our own limitation is, paradoxically, a source of increased limitation:What Gray finds is the idea that all is not well with us, and the progressing march of world-history, even where such progress is real, cannot improve our fundamental problems. Our modern values and new ideas cannot improve our answers to the most pressing questions any more than the values and ideas of our forebears could stave off the existential angst and atrocities of their times. Are we really so naxc3xafve to think our generation is the different one? Gray thinks we are.John Gray is one of the most genuinely original and countercultural writers today, and he comes by it only by repeating the most self-evident truths of life.The Seven Types of Atheism Seven Types of Atheism is Grayxe2x80x99s examination of contemporary atheism. A growing trend. He starts with a chapter on the New Atheists movement of the past 20 years. Grayxe2x80x99s contempt for these contemporary would-be philosophes is such that he can barely bring himself to refer to them by name. The likes of Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris are, he judges, xe2x80x9cmostly a media phenomenon and best appreciated as a type of entertainment.xe2x80x9dInstead he sets out an argument. xe2x80x9cThere is no such thing as xe2x80x98the atheist worldview,xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d he argues, because xe2x80x9catheism simply excludes the idea that the world is the work of a creator-god.xe2x80x9d Some people identify atheism with scientific rationalism, but science cannot dispel religionxe2x80x94not least because religion is not a set of hypotheses to be disproven. Rather, it is anythingxe2x80x94myths, rituals, even illusionsxe2x80x94that makes sense of our passage through life.  Others imagine that religion was simply a stage in human evolution, now left behind, to which Gray responds: xe2x80x9cThe human mind is programmed for survival, not for truth.xe2x80x9d Grayxe2x80x99s next category, secular humanists, who for all their differences are alike in their xe2x80x9cvast hopes for social transformation.xe2x80x9d Atheists like this think they have left religion behind, but they are wrong. The history of Christianity is shot through with millenarian movements promising the end of history. After the Reformation, humanists dropped this apocalypticism in favor of gradual progress and swapped the aim of reaching the Heavenly City for the goal of building a utopia in this world through human effort. What Christianity and secular humanism share is more important than their differences.The same pattern appears again and again, Gray finds, as a mode of thought overthrows religion, only to imitate some of its characteristic intellectual moves. Evolution had no sooner vanquished Christian theology than outcroppings of xe2x80x9cevolutionary theologyxe2x80x9d began appearing.A subset of science-based atheists are the xe2x80x9ctranshumanists,xe2x80x9d who believe that we are destined to become gods. Ray Kurzweil is the most confident exponent of transhumanism today, certain that by genetically enhancing ourselves and melding our minds with machines, we will produce a qualitatively new version of Homo sapiens, perhaps in the twenty-first century. Gray, as usual, finds these supposedly daring speculations to be merely variations on an ancient tune: the age-old dream of transcending physical limitations and historical contingency and uniting with the Absolute.Not all modern atheists are unwitting Christians. Some are Gnostics. In that ancient mystery religion the earth was created by a malevolent demiurge, while a transcendent God dwells, inaccessible, in a realm of light, unknowable except by those who receive a special, secret revelation. Esoteric knowledgexe2x80x94ideologyxe2x80x94is, Gray argues, responsible for the modern political religions. Jacobins, Positivists, Bolsheviks, Nazis, and Maoists all featured an elite stratum of intellectuals whose mastery of some body of liberating ideasxe2x80x94Rousseauist republicanism, Comtean xe2x80x9csocial science,xe2x80x9d Marxism-Leninism, Aryan race science, Mao Zedong Thoughtxe2x80x94entitled them to rule the uninitiated. That each of these movements was irrational, intolerant, authoritarian, and apocalypticxe2x80x94hence religious, on one view of religionxe2x80x94no one can dispute. Gray goes on an on with other groups throughout the book.Feline PhilosophyRather than groping for meaning in a universe that offers none, we should try to be more like cats, creatures congenitally xe2x80x9chappy being themselves.xe2x80x9d Gray offers a scheme for emulating the catlike qualities that might permit us to xe2x80x9cthrive without anxiously inquiring how to live.xe2x80x9dWhat is a Book Recommendation?Ultimately, a book recommendation shouldnxe2x80x99t become a book review. What I did here is just sketch out some themes of the books. But it isnxe2x80x99t really the book. The book is the book. No real great book can be summarized. Or else, why read it? Just read the cliff notes. March 18th 2017A book recommendation is a matter of trust. I like it, and maybe you will too. But I canxe2x80x99t really summarize it or it probably wasnxe2x80x99t a good book in the first place. Reading is still an experience.

Economy of prose and concision of argument shows a fundamental respect for the reader (xe2x80x98If I had had more time I would have written you a shorter letterxe2x80x99 to paraphrase the old quip)Feline Philosophy has been lingering in my mind since I read it on Boxing Day in a single sitting (an excellent Christmas gift). I love his use of literature as a source of examples and illustrations as I do the fact that he is able to wear his (clearly formidable) learning lightly. The inability to do this is often the Achilles heel of the modern academic.But above all Gray seems a good soul and a vital corrective to the utopian, transhumanist and progress blind spirit of the present.

Some journalist did a podcast and made up a story about a jihadi in Syria. It was all fake. And not like traditional fake news, which is mostly bias, selective reporting, playing with words and headlines or burying the lede, this was real fake news. They made up an entire story. Fake. The guy who made up the story didnxe2x80x99t even go to Syria. How do you fuck up a story on ISIS? The news is so bad. But it got me thinking, it had me reminiscing. I sit back and my mind wanders to 2013-2014 Twitter. Twitter back then was a different place. You had real terrorists publicly posting everyday. You had ISIS accounts posting videos daily and posting maps and memes. I donxe2x80x99t need to listen to some podcast about ISIS, because I watched it firsthand. On my laptop. Everyday. Memes like this would pop up sometimes:Ixe2x80x99ve been on the internet most of my adult life, and 2013-2014 ISIS Twitter was crazy.2004 Iraq WarDecember 26th 2020War before ISIS Twitter was a different thing. You are a civilian, sitting in the United States of America. A country that has no borders with any enemies. A country with the biggest military in the world. President Bush announced that there would be an invasion of Afghanistan and later Iraq and you just nodded your head. Later on, NBC, CBS, CNN or Fox News would send some journalist with a flak jacket out there to xe2x80x9creport on it.xe2x80x9dNo one really knew what was going on. The reporter or journalist would create some narrative and you would just accept it. There was no alternative. You didnxe2x80x99t even really know who the enemy was, just some shadowy religious extremists or cruel middle east dictator. Then one day a scandal would pop up, or some massacre, or a big battle like Fallujah. It would make the news cycle, politicians would comment on it, the news anchors would discuss it, articles in the Washington Post or NYtimes would be written on it. It was just so remote, abstract and bizarre.Sometimes the pentagon would host a press conference, show the journalists a powerpoint slide, answer questions and leave. Conducting war was basically an excel spreadsheet. Tools for Making VideosDan Crenshaw @DanCrenshawTXDecember 13th 2020In the early 2000s video equipment got much better, cheaper and the masses had access to Hollywood style equipment and editing software. They told us that a renaissance in filmmaking would happen and you would see incredible films being made by amateurs. Think of millions of films with the quality of the Godfather or Citizen Kane online. That future didnxe2x80x99t happen. It turns out it takes a lot of acting talent, scriptwriting, and camera work to make a great movie. So instead, we got something like Tik-Tok, amateur porn and xe2x80x9cquirkyxe2x80x9d youtube explainer videos with fast cuts. Filmmaking never decentralized, but filming war did. In 2013 I was living in the DC area working a job I hated. I remember logging in one late night and viewing a video someone retweeted on my TL. It was called The Clanging of the Swords. The footage was nuts. It was a mostly combat footage montage captured in HD filmed in the first person that looked like a James Bond film from out of hell. People were being shot, run over, snipers, bombs and quick edits. It even had terrorists give speeches, burning their passport and crowds. There was music overlaid on the video. Ixe2x80x99ve never seen anything like that in my life. It was better filmed than any Hollywood movie. And it was real. Which made it much more shocking than any movie could ever be. I remember finishing it and thinking, the most evil people on the planet are fighting a war and now theyxe2x80x99re going to tell their side of the story. History is Written by the WinnersWe never really hear from the other side. December 21st 2020The Roman where great historians. They just didn't like to record their defeats. But that applies to all conquerors. You hear one side of the story, and eventually thatxe2x80x99s the side that gets written and taught in school. ISIS comes along in 2012-2014, buys equipment like Go-Pros, Final Cut Pro, digital cameras and decides to start a media company during a war. Buzzfeed for JihadismIn 2013 if you were on the internet you had options for content. Some people went to Buzzfeed, Deadspin or Huffington Post. Other people went online and followed the Syrian war - from both sides. You could do that. And ISIS would oblige by putting out daily content. It was another content farm. Except it had bombings, skirmishes, suicide car bombs. It was nuts. It got even crazier when you were on twitter. I remember following this particular ISIS account called ShamiWitness. He tweeted in english and got up to around 20k followers. It got weird because you had American think tank members and journalists tell you to follow him on Follow Friday. Ixe2x80x99m sitting here thinking, xe2x80x9cthis guy is a terroristxe2x80x9d, whatxe2x80x99s going on. It turns out the person who ran the ShamiWitness account was a middle manager in some large Indian IT firm. He was posting at work. Probably bored with time to spare. Technology and WarWhen most people think of the printing press they think of literacy and people reading books and being happy. There is another under discussed aspect to the creation of the printing press by Gutenberg in the 1400s, the extreme religious violence that followed the creation of the printing press The word xe2x80x9cmedievalxe2x80x9d is almost always pejorative but the post-printing early modern period was the golden age of religious hatred and torture; the major witch hunts occurred in an age of rising literacy, because what people wanted to read about was a lot of the time complete garbage. Just like the Reformation era, the age of social media has eroded the role of the information gatekeepers xe2x80x93 the Catholic Church in the 1500s and journalists today. propaganda employed by both Luther and the Catholic Church. Often vulgar and gory were used.The Reformation was more than just a war of words: It turned violent, creating religious refugees on both sides xe2x80x93 many of whom fled to North America.War Before the Geneva ConventionYou were not watching modern war in Syria . You were watching an ancient war with no rules. There would be execution of prisoners of war regularly, on camera.ISIS took conquered a town that was filled with Yazidis and made them their literal slaves. Then they sold the slaves in markets in Raqqah. It was intense. There was no law here. Only mayhem. But there was a method to the mayhem. ISIS built a reputation from all those media clips online of massacres. If you were in a town and heard they were coming, you would just leave. You wouldnxe2x80x99t want to think of fighting. Why bother, they werenxe2x80x99t taking prisoners. This is a very ancient strategy: War statistics are inflated. With both sides having an excuse to exaggerate the amount of deaths: The conquerors for intimidating future opponents, the conquered to justify their submission.The fourth installment of the Clanging of the Swords video series, for example, released in May 2014, plays like a satanic episode of Cops: Videographers with handheld equipment ride along with ISIS death squads as they pursue and assassinate Iraqi security personnel, some of whom are shown begging for their lives. These videos helped persuade police and soldiers in other cities to melt away rather than resist when they heard that ISIS forces were on the march.    ISIS added talented foreigners as specialists with experience in the Westxe2x80x94men like Ahmad Abousamra, a former Northeastern University computer-science student who became a top figure at the office that specializes in non-Arabic content. The influx of talent has brought new levels of polish and creativity to the Islamic Statexe2x80x99s media output: GoPro cameras  affixed to AK-47s and sniper rifles, for example, resulting in first-person scenes that seem plucked from the Call of Duty videogame franchise.DorseyDoes Jack Dorsey have blood on his hands? I donxe2x80x99t think people should be kicked off of Twitter and Ixe2x80x99m pretty pro free speech. but terrorists on his platforming coordinating activities and recruiting seems too much. Even for me. We know Twitter has the tools to moderate content. They are doing to Donald Trump in 2020 with red flags over his assertion that the 2020 election was fraudulent. December 24th 2020It took Twitter until mid 2015 to start suspending ISIS accounts. I remember all of this starting, or at least when I started seeing it, in late 2012. Thatxe2x80x99s three years. Three years is a long time. Eastern SyriaDecember 29th 2016They Just Went AwayISIS mostly disappeared over the years. Perhaps you can find their content on some websites, Ixe2x80x99m not even sure if they are still distributing content like they used to. They are not on Twitter everyday like they used to be in 2013-2014. Therexe2x80x99s more I can talk about but, I think it has been said elsewhere. Their clips may even seem cliche now. Their style has been copied. But back then,  no one ever saw such a thing. The first military group to document their war and atrocities, and to do it proudly. The xe2x80x9cother sidexe2x80x9d. If the Syrian war happened in 1999, you would never have heard about them. Maybe the Washington Post would do an article on them, call them religious extremists. That would be that. Instead, they picked up the camera and filmed it themselves. It was the craziest time I ever spent on the internet. And I will never forget it. All that is left on twitter is old clips from 2016. It seems like pre 2016 content has been wiped.

Energy was in the air, the call went out. Come and join the Caliphate! Believers flocked from all over the world for the Summer of Death.Once invented and demonstrated, this style of content never went away. While ISIS got b& off twatter by '16, Novorossian uprising started in the winter of '14 with much the same riffs on wartime reporting, less outright atrocities and more right-wing rap, since both sides were more or less white and postmodern-nationalist. High points were Arseniy \"Motorola\" Pavlov hailing Christ while sending shells downrange with his MT-12 Rapier AT cannon, and Mikhail \"Givi\" Tolstykh nonchalantly brushing shrapnel off his shoulder while giving an interview in the midst of cockhol bombing run on his block. You can still find these videos in circulation on *chans and on vk.comNowadays, (Novo)Russian PMCs, \"moderate rebels\" and ISIS remnant all still make entertaining content from the sandbox, and they are joined by Kurds, pro-Assad militias and turkroach paramilitaries. None of this *quite* has the production values of Saleel Sawarim the Series, but they sure are trying. Also, Central and South American drug cartels seem to be catching up not only on medieval brutality, but on propaganda production and distribution as well.I'd say that gonzo war porn is now Lindy.No posts","title":"Revisiting 2013 ISIS Twitter - The Lindy Newsletter","url":"https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/revisiting-2013-isis-twitter"}

Perhaps the most underappreciated instrument in the history of music, yet one of the most delicate and unique ones.Even though its predecessor, the lute and the baroque guitar, managed to dominate a big part of the pre-classical era, the nylon string xe2x80x9cSpanishxe2x80x9d guitar was only alive for 100-150 years, only to be replaced by the electric guitar and the chord strumming trope.But some people argue that wexe2x80x99re still in the early phases of its conception. It is regarded as an xe2x80x9cincompletexe2x80x9d instrument with a limited repertoire, that saw an expansion in the late 19th and early 20th century.People are always surprised when they hear a piece played on it. The soft timbre, combined with its aggressive polyphony can produce a completely different sound compared to what wexe2x80x99re used to.The classical guitar possesses the linearity of a string instrument and the contrapuntal qualities of the piano. You can play everything on it if you have the skill.My guitar teacher used to say that half of classical music was composed for the piano and the other half for the violin. The guitar didnxe2x80x99t have much space, so it pierced through them.It's an instrument that has been transformed numerous times, depending on the needs of the era.What we know today as the classical, nylon string guitar possesses the linearity of a string instrument and the contrapuntal qualities of the piano. You can play everything on it if you have the skill.While the traditional repertoire has borrowed many of lutexe2x80x99s compositions and arrangements from other instruments, it wasnxe2x80x99t until the Spanish masters of the late 19th century managed to create original compositions and redefine the position of their native instrument to the music stage.Wexe2x80x99re going to focus on 4 pieces that take advantage of the capabilities of the instrument. We begin with the xe2x80x9cfatherxe2x80x9d of the modern classical guitar.xe2x80x9cMemories of Alhambraxe2x80x9d, a fortress complex in Granada.Notice the continuous flow of one note, using the tremolo technique. A unique trope, only possible on the classical guitar, creating the sense of a duet. It usually requires longer nails and complete control of the instrument so the sound is crisp.In this piece, it represents the flow of water inside the palace.(Fun fact: the Nokia tune theme is Tarregaxe2x80x99s Gran Vals)We travel across the pond, to the Spanish culture of the Latin America where Barrios hears a knock on his door.He opens and he sees an old lady holding her hands in the air: xe2x80x9cAn alm for the love of Godxe2x80x9d, she says.Barrios composed la ultima cancion, his last piece, inspired by this knock on the door.

This is key, because it means an outside force like fortune (luck) has to be involved. The envious want to see the envied struck down by fate or the gods. 3) A person envied may try to create the appearance that the assets he is envied for were destroyed nonvoluntarily. Basically, hiding your assets from the sight of the envious. Maybe even invent a story of a family medical problem, or lie about a threat that is causing them harm.  You also see this strategy with women. Sometimes a beautiful woman will dress down when in the company of other women she likes, in order not to draw envy. Envy Within RelationshipsEnvy within relationships is a big deal now. And this is a new phenomenon. You donxe2x80x99t see this in the ancient literature much, because men and women werenxe2x80x99t competing like they are now. Plutarch isnxe2x80x99t writing about inter-relationship envy because it probably didnxe2x80x99t exist back then. The wife and Husband didnxe2x80x99t consider themselves in the same reference group. Why would they? There was specific roles.Something has changed in the dating market over the past 40 years, men and women are pairing up based on education level and income. This is not surprising because we live in a two income society. Women compete with men for slots at university and careers. Wexe2x80x99re all doing the same thing now. One flat society. This is called educational assortative mating. When society was not so flat, you had lawyers marrying their secretaries for instance, basically a great divergence of educational and income level between the members of the couple. This is very common sentiment now:I saw this first hand. I didnxe2x80x99t have anything in the bank account. I still had access to good looking career driven women with advanced degrees. It felt strange. Like it wasnxe2x80x99t deserved. You grow up as a man and think itxe2x80x99s all about money, but then this piece of paper gets you into places you thought only money would get you into. Women just assume youxe2x80x99re temporarily down on your luck, but the degree signals something that you can always get back in the game.June 15th 2020It isnxe2x80x99t just education. Itxe2x80x99s also income level. Both spouses are playing the same career game. That isnxe2x80x99t just money, but also titles, respect, honors and status.\"The top decile of menxe2x80x99s earners married to the top decile of womenxe2x80x99s earners has doubled from 10.6 percent in 1970 to 23.3 percent in 2018.\"Branko Milanovic @BrankoMilanJune 19th 2020How to Avoid Inter-Relationship EnvyI think inter-relationship envy is widespread. Take for example, the current news cycle. The new is currently reporting on if Joe Bidenxe2x80x99s wife, Jill, and if she should be able to refer to herself as xe2x80x9cDoctorxe2x80x9d even though she has a PhD not an MD. The news is dumb. They are missing the real story. Which is Jill Biden only got the doctorate because felt inferior to Joe. She considered herself part of his reference group and couldnxe2x80x99t handle it.As a man, quite honestly, it is very easy for me to not feel envy toward my spouse. Wexe2x80x99re on the same team. If there is problems on the team the entire enterprise falls apart. We lose our minds, our jobs, we end up on welfare or she ends up in prostitution and me to crime. Why? Because there was dissension in the ranks. This canxe2x80x99t happen. You have to keep the car on the road when youxe2x80x99re in a relationship and that means playing a role. Playing a position. Ixe2x80x99ve never felt envy in any relationship Ixe2x80x99ve ever been in.But Ixe2x80x99ve felt envied by former girlfriends, and know relationships where envy is a factor. Obviously no one will admit it, remember Part 1 when I mentioned that envy is the only emotion where we refuse to admit? Instead it bubbles up wearing a mask of contempt, pleasure at seeing someone fail and certain remarks. Not good. I donxe2x80x99t want this in the bedroom.February 22nd 2020Some people like to distinguish between xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cbadxe2x80x9d envy within a relationship. In my opinion, why play with fire? Why risk ruin? Just switch your reference group to other people, other groups. If your reference group includes your spouse you may get a PhD or you may breakup. To me, risking ruin is never worth it. Wexe2x80x99ve seen what breakups do to people. Asymmetry of EnvyDecember 1st 2018Sibling EnvyIf you have brothers or sisters, we have all felt it. Sibling rivalry. Itxe2x80x99s not pretty. It leads to fights at home or not talking to each other for years. Plutarch recommends a strategy to defuse sibling envy by emphasizing aspects in which the inferior is superior. Big brother needs to talk up younger brothers attributes. Envy at ScaleSo far wexe2x80x99ve discussed envy at the individual level. Letxe2x80x99s discuss society wide envy. At a large scale, redistributive tax policies have been interpreted in this light. Taleb in his article on inequality argues that proponents of equality miss out on real equality being about churn, going up and down various income brackets in a lifetime. The rich today were not the rich yesterday and the middle class and working class is constantly in flux.  He argues that there is a certain group which envies the super rich because they see the super rich as in their reference group. Does elite mean you went to Harvard, work as a professor, intellectual or does elite mean you own a business and have billions in the bank? He essentially argues that modern day class envy isn't from a truck driver in South Texas, but from a NY/DC Ivy League educated IYI (Krugman, Stiglitz) w/sense of entitlement upset some \"less smart\" people are much richer.But it isnxe2x80x99t clear whether tax policies are motivated by self interest or envy. The Republicans got a lot of working class votes. But if you read the New York Times you would see a lot of articles on wealth and inequality. AtheniansAthenians didnxe2x80x99t count on a regular income tax to finance the provision of public goods, the Athenians counted on the rich to volunteer, by subsidizing and organizing public services or xe2x80x9cliturgies.xe2x80x9d Xenophonxe2x80x99s Socrates recites a number of such services:As the language suggests, the contributions were not exactly voluntary. At a certain level of wealth citizens were obligated to perform these duties, but some did more than was required, and in fact competed with one another to be the most generous. When the rich subsidized sacrifices and festivals, the other Athenian citizens may have appreciated the services not only because they made them better off, but also because they made the rich worse off. The tradition of Liturgies acts as an outside power taking away wealth from the rich (back by force). The outside power decreases envy in the envious. Was the liturgy a method for avoiding societal wide envy from being absorbed within the framework of the democratic state?OstracismSometimes a group, society, tribe or nation will throw another member of its group out because they are causing too much envy. Destabilizing society. Causing problems. In his Lives, Plutarch explains the ostracisms of Themistocles and Aristides in terms of envy:For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Wow, this is excellent, such power in the writing, can feel it.Great article, Lindyman.No posts","title":"On Envy and Hate (Part 2) - The Lindy Newsletter","url":"https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/on-envy-and-hate-part-2"}

I feel like we as a society have all decided to drop teaching this subject. We now export it to psychologists, writers for the New Yorker, poets and life coaches. Ixe2x80x99m not even sure people realize there are objective and real guidelines for certain emotions, and it isnxe2x80x99t just one personxe2x80x99s opinion. There are rules and they have been the same throughout time because the human hasnxe2x80x99t changed.  I posed this simple question to my followers last week. December 9th 2020The answers I received were all over the place. I think certain topics in human nature are important, but only because it teaches us about ourselves, but also as a risk management strategy. Ixe2x80x99m not going to do something crazy because I donxe2x80x99t know how to understand whatxe2x80x99s going on in my mind. Then Ixe2x80x99m going to be wrecked, fall into ruin and itxe2x80x99s game over. And for what? Because I didnxe2x80x99t read the ownerxe2x80x99s manual to the car called the human? Well, thatxe2x80x99s stupid. The Lindy Effect for human nature is about usefulness. Of harm reduction or avoidance. It isnxe2x80x99t some academic exercise of knowledge or a modern art piece. Itxe2x80x99s about having a gun in your hand while walking through a dangerous neighborhood.  As Samuel Johnson said, xe2x80x9dWe are all envious naturally, but by checking envy, we get the better of itxe2x80x9dSo today, letxe2x80x99s discuss an important topic. Itxe2x80x99s about envy and hate. Wexe2x80x99re going to use a variety of ancient sources to come up with a definition, how it works at the individual level, at the society level, how to extinguish it and why itxe2x80x99s so important. Wexe2x80x99re going to examine envy in todayxe2x80x99s world as well. Which is a little different than two thousand years ago. What is Envy?Itxe2x80x99s roughly, a belief that another person has something that I want and xe2x80x9cit could have been mexe2x80x9d. To attract envy all that is required is apparent prosperity. Envy presupposes that I can tell myself a plausible story in which I ended up with the possessions of the envy. This story has to be realistic. Princes may envy kings and starlets envy stars but most people donxe2x80x99t envy kings. The objects of envy are  closely connected to me. I envy someone if I believe I could have been like him. The reason I envy rather than try to emulate him is often that I do not believe I CAN become like him- although we were equal at the outset. For instance, I donxe2x80x99t envy Donald Trump. Hexe2x80x99s not in the group I identify with or cluster.  So, already in the definition of envy we require a reference  group. Itxe2x80x99s relational and scale dependent.  So who do we compare ourselves too? Usually, people who have the same career as us:July 2nd 2020There is an old saying, that the best friends are those who read the same books as you do but have different careers. Why? So you can engage in conversation but not have envy which will destroy the relationship and maybe even the people in it. During the Trump presidency I noticed many celebrities who had this intense hatred for him. This level of malice was more than what they threw at George W. Bush and he started 2 wars and ended in a huge recession. I think the reason is these celebrities are envious of him. Donald Trump was the first true outsider to win the presidency, the first media monoculture celebrity from the 20th century to attain the highest office. These other celebrities in Hollywood really felt it. They tried to cover it up as part of the xe2x80x9cresistancexe2x80x9d, but it came across as something different than the regular hysterical behavior. To Hollywood, Trump was part of their reference group.What is Being Envied? Plutarch cites as grounds for envy: wealth (Nicias), Hubris (Alcibiades), reclusiveness (Nicias), having made the mistake of being right too many times (Aristides), virtue and status. Admitting to being EnviousOne of the things that distinguishes envy from other emotions is that we donxe2x80x99t want to admit it. If wexe2x80x99re angry we say wexe2x80x99re angry, if wexe2x80x99re in love, we say we are in love, if we are sad we say we are sad. But we have a hard time admitting envy. Itxe2x80x99s special. It digs deep. As a result we cloak envy and conceal it. We give other reasons for attacking a person. Among all the emotions of the soul, one stands unmentionable. Envy. Thatxe2x80x99s powerful. Reference Group On its surface, the reference group seems easy to imagine. People you work with or live around. Ok. But it isnxe2x80x99t that simple these days. We live in a unique society these days. For instance, this was one the richest men in the world a few hundred years ago:This is one of the richest men in the world now:Do you see whatxe2x80x99s going on? Zuckerberg shouldnxe2x80x99t be in your reference group, hexe2x80x99s got 100 billion dollars. But he dresses like you, looks like you and he started a website which is trivial that made him a lot of money. Can I do that? March 5th 2020This tweet hit some of my followers hard. Theyxe2x80x99re software programmers/engineers/coders. Software developers feel like they should be in the payoff space. In theory they have all the skills needed to make payoffs happen (automating things at scale). Yet most of them remain stuck in the consistency space. Very frustrating place to be. What adds to the frustration is not only being so close, but also seeing those who made large amounts of money act like they are in your reference group. The flipside of xe2x80x9cthis could be youxe2x80x9d is xe2x80x9cthis is not youxe2x80x9d but youxe2x80x99re going to be comparing yourself to them. Isocrates:The monarch might, in fact take active steps to make himself appear beyond envy. According to Herodotus: Instagram and EnvyA lot of people are working BS jobs or jobs theyxe2x80x99ve checked out from. They donxe2x80x99t identify themselves with their careers. So their reference group isnxe2x80x99t work. itxe2x80x99s something else. What is it? People they follow on Instagram and Facebook. The problem is people on those sites are posting vacation photos and achievements. Youxe2x80x99re just getting someonexe2x80x99s best times beamed at you through the screen, but without any of their bad times. You start to think your life sucks, or you want what they have. Then everyone else engages in it and it becomes weird. Then you add in the people marketing a brand or a product and it ends up being a big source of unhappiness. Every once in a while Instagram or Facebook try to address envy concerns by proposing hiding the follower number. Youxe2x80x99re artificially increasing your reference group and then only being selectively shown someonexe2x80x99s life they want to show you. A lot of envy in those places. Then this brings up the question if we can truly xe2x80x9cchoosexe2x80x9d our reference group. Or is it chosen for us by our circumstances. I donxe2x80x99t know how to answer that question. Envy EnjoymentClearly, envying someone is a horrible feeling. You feel terrible doing it. But what about being envied? Spanish poet, Francisco de Quevedo said, xe2x80x9cthat whoever does not want to be envied does not want to be a man.xe2x80x9d    So being envied is a signal, at least, that youxe2x80x99re doing something relatively remarkable. But the actual feeling of being envied by others is enjoyable on its own. But the enjoyment feels a little like ashes in the mouth. It is not a xe2x80x9ccleanxe2x80x9d enjoyment so to speak. But crucially, it also means you are not successful enough, People think you are in their reference group! Things also can get really weird and dirty when there is someone who enjoys being envied by another who is envious. This crazy relationship. The envied will try to keep the envious dangling, finding fun in the misery of the other. You see this a lot in the workplace. These little games people play within teams or departments. Or, you see it at social events. Itxe2x80x99s also dangerous. Look at what happened to John Lennon and Versace. Killed by some crazy envious men. Envy Provoked by a Third PartyWhatxe2x80x99s the definition of being rich? Itxe2x80x99s having one more dollar than your wifexe2x80x99s sisterxe2x80x99s husband. Sometimes youxe2x80x99ll be thrown into some game of envy you didnxe2x80x99t sign up for. But you are obliged to play because youxe2x80x99re a social creature who exists in this world. Youxe2x80x99re being defined by this group. Sometimes this can be very annoying. Picture 2 couples. The husband is working on a project with upside but it isnxe2x80x99t here yet (it may never come). The other man in the other couple has a steady job making good money. The first fellow will seem like he is behind in the game. Although, they are in two different domains and shouldnxe2x80x99t be compared. Preemption How do people end up dealing with envy? A few ways. 1) Immediate suppression of the envious urge and go along with your life. This is what most people do day to day. 2) Devalue the person. A common mechanism is to devalue other aspects of the person whom one would otherwise envy. The stereotype that beautiful blondes are dumb is probably due to other womenxe2x80x99s envy rather than to male chauvinism. La Bruyere noted that adding additional criteria of evaluation was prominent in French villages, xe2x80x9cIt is possible for a villager to reject or annul almost any bid for prestige or accusation of low status because of the diversity of ranking criteria.xe2x80x9d Once a person has identified some aspect in which he is superior to the envied person he will tend to value that aspect more highly, a bit like the person who after hesitating between two cars ends up buying one because it is faster and then upgrades the importance of speed relative to the other criteria. 3) Devaluing the the envied object. The famous story from Aesop Fablexe2x80x99s about the fox and the sour grapes is about this. Or today we hear sometimes there is a rich person in the neighborhood we say, xe2x80x9cLook at how many hours he works, I donxe2x80x99t want that lifexe2x80x9d. The superior possessions of the other are not denied, but the envious person alleviates the tension in a different way, by saying its not worth getting due to the cost. November 26th 2019Nietzsche argued Christianity resolves the tension of envy by declaring that possessions are never desirable and are in fact an obstacle to salvation. This changes values. And rather than having to debunk each instance of superiority by some explanation, the inferior can now tell himself that he is superior by virtue of the properties that formerly constituted his inferiority. Extinguishing EnvyLetxe2x80x99s say you have some success in life. You have wealth, status, virtue, etc. You see people are envious and you want to put a stop it it because envy can be dangerous. The immediate action tendency of envy is to destroy the envied object or its possessor. That means you. If you listen to hip-hop, the theme of envy keeps coming up in lyrics. As the rappers are from the lower class on their way up to the upper class and facing envy (xe2x80x9chatersxe2x80x9d) all the way up. I thought this was all fake when I was growing up. But I started posting on twitter and gaining followers, I started seeing people hate me for no reason. Real dark stuff. Then once I was out of those smaller account categories (reference groups) I was attacked by larger accounts as I gained followers. You see this same pattern in business and other status endeavors. Ideally, I would like to enjoy my material possessions and to bask in your envy of them, but if you destroy them I cannot also enjoy them. This is the standard paradox for the Greeks xe2x80x93 one wants to be honored and this is impossible for a poor man, and yet honor and wealth inspire envy in others and this envy must not be fostered. Because some envious men will try to destroy me or my things. This is a universal feeling. One thing we know is clear about envy is that it extinguishes by fortune (luck, chance). If you ascend high enough over your reference group they wonxe2x80x99t see you as a peer and you will not be envied anymore. Plutarch uses the example of Alexander the Great. The other way to extinguish to envy is another mechanism fortune: Losing it all! No one envies a man who falls down the ladder. They pity him.  But letxe2x80x99s say you want to take things into your own hands and not wait for fortune to either help you ascend to the heavens or down the ladder to hell. What can you do? StrategiesTo avoid being the target of destructive envy; one can either divest oneself of onexe2x80x99s assets or hide them. However, divestiture may be self-defeating:1) You can give the envious a gift, bribe them, buy them off, shower them in presents so they stop envying. This doesnxe2x80x99t work and in fact causes even more envy 2) Outright destruction of assets might not achieve the goal either, because it suggests an enviable lack of concern for the envied goods.3)xe2x80xa6.End of Part 1xe2x80x94xe2x80x94Part 2: Strategies, and how Envy affects society at scale to be Published on ThursdayNo posts","title":"On Envy and Hate (Part 1) - The Lindy Newsletter","url":"https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/on-envy-and-hate-part-1"}

A biweekly email focusing on music. The emphasis will be on a variety of styles and genres that have one thing in common: surviving the filter of time. Todayxe2x80x99s piece is about music that is over 200 years old. We can assume the Lindy music we highlight here will outlast most, if not all, of what we heard during our life. So, before you die. You may as well listen to music that that will live a longer life than yoursTom Holland @holland_tomJuly 15th 2020IntroductionYou can skip this section and get to the music below. I would like to say something about pop music.I referenced survival as a reason to listen to certain music. But there is another argument. based on art that I want to explore. Pop music looks like music, but it isnxe2x80x99t. When it comes to art, the question we need to ask is: what does the work of art consist? Or better: where is the work happening? When it comes to real artists the art is in something like the conception. When it comes to pop artists like Mick Jagger, Jay Z, Lana Del Ray, the work is not in the music, it is located somewhere else. Pop music isnxe2x80x99t directed to music. The artist himself stands large and demands that you pay attention to him. The music is, at most, a way of directing your attention to him, he captures your attention and your fascination. His music is like his words. You look through the music to the person, or to an artistic model of the person. Itxe2x80x99s not the what of sound but the what of action and personality that interests us when we are engaged with pop music. Or, to give a different image: when it comes to pop music, the artist stands between us and anything music. And he does this on purpose. This basic fact, that pop music is about the man or woman, the group, not the music sheds light. From this standpoint we can appreciate that it is no accident that pop music is the music of fandom and the cult of personality. It is in the attention to style and attitude and posture and politics that the art of pop happens. Pop stars are sex symbols, and when we love them, we want in some sense to be like them, or at least to be with them and to have them, to belong to their tribe. Pop music is always tribal. Thatxe2x80x99s why it is also always generational. Pop music is directly concerned with identification and with why we want to identify with something new or different, with something old that is new again, or something new that is really old.Pop music is time bound and an occasion for nostalgia in a way that music never is. Hearing a pop tune can take you back to a summer, or an evening, or an emotional state. Hearing Beethoven piano sonata doesnxe2x80x99t have that kind of effect, or if it does, that is incidental to the musicxe2x80x99s significance. That is because a pop song, but not a work of music, is precisely a positioning in a space of stylistic possibilities that is temporally and culturally local. To get the song is to get its position int hat space, and to identify with it or imaginatively take it up. Pop music, even the best and most enduring, dates itself, not just in the sense that you can read off its date, but int he sense that pop music directly engages sounds, looks, attitudes that are specific to a time and place.   Pop music isnxe2x80x99t primarily music. Itxe2x80x99s an art of display. Itxe2x80x99s a personal style. Everything a person does is marked by his or her distinctive style. You can tell an artist by his makings and identify a person by her signature. Itxe2x80x99s true, art is always preoccupied with style. Painters borrow, copy, sample and innovate off of each other, and so, in this sense, style, the way a line is made, understood against the background of all the ways we know it has been made before, is the very subject matter of the artistxe2x80x99s investigation.But pop music is an art of style in a more direct way. Painters investigate style as it finds expression in the language of picture making. And musiciansxe2x80x94acousmatic musiciansxe2x80x94 are students of style in the domain of song and melody and the like. Pop musicians, in contract are interested not in a distinctively musical style, but in fashion, in style as a personal and so also as a collective and a generational marker. Pop music, we might say, is the art of fashion. If you want to understand the music of a pop star, you turn your attention not to the music but to the man himself and to the personality he offered the world through his music. Art, indeed plays with style but Pop music is concerned with personal style in a more direct way. This is why, when it comes to to music, music is political. We sort tribes by their music. The hippies, the punks, the jocks, the mods, the rockers, etc. Black music, white music. These differences matter in pop music. EndConversationsIt is said that music is the gift of the Gods to humanity. But Mozartxe2x80x99s music is the gift of humanity to the Gods.Many composers have stood the test of time. Beethoven, Schubert, Bach. All of them created unimaginably beautiful compositions.Yet, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart became synonymous with music itself. Everything we hear on the radio today could not exist without his influence 200+ years ago.Ixe2x80x99d argue hexe2x80x99s the most famous composer of all time. Everyone has heard his tunes and melodies, even if they donxe2x80x99t know theyxe2x80x99re his.A common, everyday man, his music reflected the struggles of the common folk. Compared to his contemporaries, he focused on human nature instead of idealism and xe2x80x9cgerman valuesxe2x80x9d.Through his work, he managed to break down and express the instincts and imperfections that make us mortal men.Mozart perfected practically every form and method of writing music. Operas, symphonies, quartets, etc.But the piano concertos are where his genius unfolded.Today, wexe2x80x99re going to talk about Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466. Specifically, movement 1:Mozart was generally a happy, nonchalant man, almost vulgar in his optimism, but there are always darker undertones in his compositions, confessing a hidden side.This concerto is one of the two he composed in a minor scale.Like every concerto, wexe2x80x99re looking at a conversation between solo instrument and orchestra.00:00 - The orchestra introduces the theme. Basses, with swift motions, establish a narrative.At 00:28, the motif is elevated in the violins, becoming a high pitched shriek, leading to an orchestral tutti, where every instrument is arguing with each other.This continues for a bit until we hear a second theme at 00:51, fleshed out, pronounced.(Mozart has no issue creating back and forth within the orchestra itself, presenting different subjects simultaneously)At 2:25, the piano finally barges in, almost rushing to say its piece. But only for a brief moment, untilxe2x80xa62:50 - Therexe2x80x99s a ritornello, the orchestra returns.Therexe2x80x99s always balance. There are moments where orchestra and piano work together but no element stands out in an ugly way. Usually, they complement each other and through the antithesis, we arrive at new ideas and sounds. The reconciliation.Take 2:58, for example. The soft murmuring of the piano brushes the original theme with a new color. From here on out, the conversation continues, exploring the xe2x80x9cargumentxe2x80x9d (the subject) in different variations, chromaticism, and scales.At 11:10, after many iterations of the theme by the orchestra, the solo instrument reaches the cadenza. A solo performance that, in the time of Mozart, was improvised by the soloist on the spot.This is Beethovenxe2x80x99s improvisation.Therexe2x80x99s a childlike wonder in the sense that therexe2x80x99s freedom for the piano to explore the narrative on its own. But at 13:26, we have another ritornello, not even from the beginning of the theme, just randomly cuts off the piano, leading to the CODA. The end.Itxe2x80x99ll be helpful to listen to the rest of the concerto. It follows the typical form. The first movement is usually dynamic, following the traditional sonata form.The second movement (from 14:36 to 24:01) is usually slower, more melodic.The last movement (from 24:01 to the end) is dance-like, almost comical. Rondo, scherzo, it has a xe2x80x9cmoodxe2x80x9d.Then, move to these 3 concertos but listen to them like theyxe2x80x99re xe2x80x9cpeoplexe2x80x9d having a debate. Pay attention to the distinctive themes and the back and forth between orchestra and piano.(sublime second movement)    (the second concerto in a minor scale)(his last concerto, listen to the sad, minor, undertones)    xe2x80x9cMozart is the highest, the culminating point that beauty has attained in the sphere of music.xe2x80x9d- Tchaikovsky@AscoltareMusicFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.we're going to take it nice and slow with this new feature.

He's going to enjoy his many hours eatingI find what you say about the personality cult around pop musicians interesting. I never really knew any Beatles songs, so some time ago I decided to remedy this oversight by looking them up on YouTube. There are lots of \"Best of the Beatles\" collections there. But here's what I discovered: in all of those, the commenters bitterly complain that these aren't the real Beatles songs, because it's all cover versions. Now for me, from a mostly classical music background, this is a peculiar objection: in classical music the composers are mostly all dead, so ALL of it is always a cover version. If the music is any good, there is actually no reason to think the cover versions would be any worse than the original. As you note, it's about the music, not the personality, and this remains true even in cases where the composers used their music very forcefully as vehicles for their personality, e.g. Beethoven or Wagner.In the case of some pop music, it may well be Lindy, particularly songs with memorable melodies, like the Beatles or ABBA. It's too early to tell, but if it's Lindy, you can be sure there will be a profusion of cover versions that will eventually be as popular as the originals. Such music will, however, perhaps slip into the genre of folk music. After all, the world's folk songs were all composed by someone or other (in many cases, they likely evolved via contributions by a succession of composers). They became popular folk songs by being, well, popular. They had some or other thing about them that made them stick in the mind, and in this sense they are also classics. We have no idea who composed, say, Greensleeves, but it's very much Lindy (versions of it have been around for five centuries or more), and we can be sure the song's popularity is due to the music rather than the personality of whoever first came up with it. Perhaps some of Jagger or Lennon's work will eventually fall into this category. No posts","title":"Lindy Music #1 - The Lindy Newsletter","url":"https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/lindy-music-1"}

I think itxe2x80x99s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Why did I like it? I donxe2x80x99t know. It wasnxe2x80x99t because it was about the plot which centered around the Charles Manson murders. The film seemed to use it as an excuse. An excuse for what? Just to transport you to Tarantinoxe2x80x99s lavishly reconstructed LA in 1969 with cars, drive-ins, hot hairy hippie chicks, Margot Robbiexe2x80x99s starlet blonde, Bruce Lee, Brad Pitt playing a cool guy stunt driver and DiCaprio as a former cowboy on his own TV series but is now on a downward career arc. The viewer is transported to a place and time that was filled with cool characters. People looked different, talked different and there was cultural trends happening that were specific to that era. 1969 was the year of Woodstock but also the last year of the Cowboy Era, when Hollywood made Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, True Grit, and The Wild Bunch. The western was a great American genre that went away after decades. Another film gave me same reaction: Chinatown. xe2x80x9cChinatownxe2x80x9d is also a great movie, right? It was filmed in 1974 but it is supposed to depict LA in 1937. The film is in the noir tradition of looking at whatxe2x80x99s going on underneath the sunny narrative of American life. But would xe2x80x9cChinatownxe2x80x9d be made today? I donxe2x80x99t think so. I canxe2x80x99t imagine a film like Chinatown being at the theaters.  You just drift in the hypnosis of that film because itxe2x80x99s this beautiful rendering of Los Angeles xe2x80x94 great characters keep appearing and unfolding, and Jack Nicholson is magnetic. But that movie is about the unknowability of anything, the impossibility of affecting anything. Itxe2x80x99s the most cynical movie ever. Youxe2x80x99re telling me anybodyxe2x80x99s making that movie today? No way.xe2x80x9cMad Menxe2x80x9d is cotton candy compared with xe2x80x9cChinatown.xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99m not saying itxe2x80x99s not interesting, but itxe2x80x99s a different beast. xe2x80x9cChinatown,xe2x80x9d you have to sit and be patient. If youxe2x80x99re looking for pacing, if youxe2x80x99re looking for plot, those are not the pleasures of that movie. Itxe2x80x99s being transported to another time in American history where people wore suits when they left the house, and talked differently. Go read Raymond Chandler, does anyone speak like that anymore? This is another America wexe2x80x99re peering into. Films in 2020 Itxe2x80x99s hard not to notice the epidemic of sequels coming out of Hollywood for the past 15 years. Itxe2x80x99s almost like every other movie is some sort of prequel or sequel. I remember the superhero movie genre starting in the early 00s and it was a pleasant surprise. Then it kept going and going and going. Wexe2x80x99re still in it. Itxe2x80x99s 2020.  In 2016, half of the Top 50 movies released were a remake or a sequel representing a 312 percent increase since 2000.It seems like this era of sequels started around 2005. The mid 2000s are an interesting time that is not discussed much. Mid-2000sA lot of things that shaped society came out right around the mid 2000s. Wikipedia really started growing in articles around 2006The first iPhone came out in 2007. The cell phone still looks like this basic design. We all still use the original iPhone, even if its called something else.In fact, Apple basically xe2x80x9cimprovesxe2x80x9d every new model by adding another camera to the back. Much like razor companies release a new razor by adding a new blade. Youtube came out in 2005. But back then there were dozens of Youtubes. All of a sudden people started gravitating toward this particular Youtube after Google acquired it in 2006. The internet was a different place pre-2005. Forums, emails, websites. The internet was a bigger place then. People had hundreds of favorites in their bookmark folder. Since then, the internet has shrunk. To only a handful of places users visit every day.Facebook came out in the mid 2000s. I remember having an account when you could only join if you had a school email address in the late 00s.  Twitter came out in 2006. Netflix was around since the 90s with dvds. I remember using them back then. That isnxe2x80x99t what Netflix is now, though. Itxe2x80x99s a different service. This online service began in the mid-2000s.Amazon started to grow fast in the mid 2000s. They went from a company just selling books to selling everything.  From 2005-2009 Amazon launched Amazon Prime, Amazon Music, Create Space and the Kindle. They moved into the cloud computing area with Amazon AWS, as well as the crowdsourcing area with Amazon Mechanical Turk. They dominated the cloud computing scene. The internet as we know it today was created in the mid 2000s and wexe2x80x99ve been there ever since. But is it just the internet?  Take a Look AroundThe problem with being down so long is that it will start looking like up to you. If you are under the age of 30 you may think things are normal. But to someone who has lived 3 decades or more you may notice something odd: we havenxe2x80x99t had a shift like we did in the past. Culture is frozen. Throughout the 20th century we had changes almost every decade. Changes in fashion, in music, in aesthetics, hairstyles, style of comedy, television shows and movies. It sort of felt like someone was directing society from the top down, dictating a big shift every 10 years to something new. A director. If I show you a photo or play you a song from the 20th century, youxe2x80x99d probably be able to guess the decade. It was that clean of a break. But I havenxe2x80x99t felt that change since the mid 2000sNovember 28th 2020All they would see is a luxury iPhone that was only released to a select few. But the hairstyles, clothes, slang and temperament are the same. Tattoos  A lot of people have tattoos. This wasnxe2x80x99t always the case. I remember when almost no one had them in the 90s and early 00s. They were considered a costly in group signal. Think of criminals, gang members, artists, sailors or tough guys. Then, somewhere along the line everyone had them. Even this tattoo artist started seeing something change in 2005.Skinny Jeans and Athleisure Athleisure (Nike, Adidas, Lululemon, etc ) and skinny jeans are still here. Both trends started in the mid 2000s. Was it always like this?Are we able to identify fashion trends by decade dating back to the 1600s or did it take longer in the past for fashion to change? They did not jump every decade like they did in the 20th century. Fashion in the gentry did change, but it happened slower, less rapidly and the intervals werenxe2x80x99t spaced out in 10 year intervals like we saw in the 20th century. Fashion was transmitted again through travel, usually by someone being at court, or visiting other gentry. Envoys that traveled, or marriages to persons from a different area would bring fashion statements from one place to another. Important events would bring large groups of people together and thus start trends that works travel throughout the area when participants returned home.Here are redditors struggling with how to remember the 2010s in fashion. They are struggling.MusicPeople are figuring out Pop music sounds the same.Why did rock n roll die? Simple business calculus. Rock n Roll has historically been a white personxe2x80x99s genre, both performers and audience. The music industry wants to make as much money as possible. If black and Hispanic audiences wonxe2x80x99t listen to rock n roll, but white people will listen to hip hop. Why give up 30 percent of the audience? Hence, Hip Hop is pop music. This is Nassim Talebxe2x80x99s Minority RuleAlgorithms So whatxe2x80x99s going on. Why is culture stuck? I have two arguments1) We lived in a 20th century media monoculture where the culture changed every decade from the top down. This was done by the handful of radio stations, television stations, hollywood and fashion houses. Then, the real internet came along in 2005 and decentralized everything. All of a sudden, small groups online have innovated and changed. But the big media monoculture has stayed the same. Why? Because the current model makes money, and why change it? Why risk it? Not everyone is going along with you like the previous century where people had no choice.  2) Algorithms November 5th 2020Culture is no longer made. It is simply curated from existing culture, refined, and regurgitated back at us. The algorithms cut off the possibility of new discovery. For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Interesting, but therexe2x80x99s a lot of things missing. Ever heard of xe2x80x9cmemesxe2x80x9d ? Thatxe2x80x99s culture. Silly maybe but itxe2x80x99s culture. Thatxe2x80x99s definitely a 2010 thing, and those memes themselves xe2x80x9cevolvexe2x80x9d. Thatxe2x80x99s culture. Go into TikTok and therexe2x80x99s plenty of culture being created there. Just because theyxe2x80x99re not being reflected in movies or music (which you could also argue) does not mean culture is stuck. A related theory that I've had is that prior to 1980, there was a constant profusion of new music genres, but since 1980, there's not been a single new music genre. In other words, every music genre that exists today was also in existence in 1980, but in 1980, nearly every popular genre of music then did not exist 40 years earlier. I have a theory as to why: music education was eliminated from most public schools during the 1980s.No posts","title":"Is Culture Stuck?  - The Lindy Newsletter","url":"https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/is-culture-stuck"}

In IPFS content is addressed by hashing the content itself to create a content-identifier (CID). Intuition tells us that if we want to retrieve a block with the CID `QmPAwRxe2x80xa6`, what our peer has to do is to go to his DHT, and trigger a lookup operation to find the specific peer storing the piece of information we want.In IPFS, this is correct as long as Bitswap has already failed in it's duty of finding blocks (more about this in a moment).What we all initially learn about IPFS is that it uses three types of key-value pairings mapped using the DHT:Provider Records that map a data identifier (i.e. multihash CID) to a peer that has advertised that they have, and are willing to provide the content (this is the DHT we mentioned above, and the one we are going to show interest in throughout this publication).Peer Records that map a peerID to a set of multiaddresses at which the peer may be reached. It is our way of discovering nodes in the network and starting connections with them.IPNS Records which map a IPNS key (hash of a public key) to a IPNS record.From this we would expect that to find any content in the network we just have to make a lookup on the provider records DHT to find the peer that can serve us with this content. However, before doing that IPFS nodes implement an exchange interface to try and speed-up this process before having to resort to the to the DHT. If you want to dig deeper on DHTs and how IPFS leverages them, I highly recommend Adin's deep-dive into the DHT over on the IPFS blog. However, the truth is that before doing that IPFS nodes implement an exchange interface to try and speed-up this process before having to resort to the to the DHT (by the way, if you want to dig deeper on DHTs and how IPFS leverages them, I highly recommend this post from the IPFS blog).Before delving into how content is requested, we are going to make a quick detour to understand how information is stored in an IPFS network. IPFS uses a Merkle DAG structure to represent data. When you request the storage of a file to the network, your node splits the file in blocks. Blocks are linked to each other, and each of them is identified with a unique CID (the hash of the content). Splitting files into blocks means that each block is stored in a different node, so when you request the file different parts come from different sources and can be authenticated quickly.The use of Merkle DAGs to store content also tackles the issue of redundancy of content in the network. If you are storing two similar files in the network, they will share parts of the Merkle DAGs, i.e. they share blocks that wonxe2x80x99t necessarily need to be stored twice. But this separation of data in blocks also means that when we want to access specific content consisting of several blocks, we need to find all the nodes that store these blocks, and request their transmission. This is the reason for the existence of Bitswap in IPFS.Bitswap is the data trading module of IPFS. It manages requesting and sending blocks to and from peers. Bitswap has two main jobs: Acquire blocks requested by our client from the network.Send other nodes blocks that they have requested So how exactly does Bitswap work? Imagine that we are searching for a file consisting of these three blocks: {CID1, CID2, CID3}, and whose root block (i.e. the root of the DAG that will allow us find the rest of the blocks of the file) is CID1. To get this file we would trigger a xe2x80x9cget CID1'' operation in our node. This is the moment Bitswap comes into play. Bitswap starts its operation by sending a WANT message to all its connected peers requesting the block for CID1. If there is no response to this request, Bitswapxe2x80x99s work is done. Our node will go to the DHT to find the node that stores the CID and end of story (no speed-ups to the standard DHT content discovery achieved).But what happens if some of our connected nodes answer to this request saying that they have this block and they send it to us? We will then remember these nodes and add them to the same session for that CID1. The fact that these nodes had the block for CID1 means that they may potentially have the rest of the blocks left for the file (CID2 and CID3). The reason why we want to remember nodes from a session is so that in the next round instead of blindly asking all our connected peers for the next CID of the DAG, flooding the network with our requests, we can narrow down a bit the search.Now imagine that instead of getting a specific file where you donxe2x80x99t know the CIDs of the rest of the blocks, you want to recover a section of a Merkle DAG for which you know in advance the CIDs. In this case instead of sending a single WANT from your node, Bitswap will send a Wantlist, i.e. a list of WANTs of CIDs. Each node will remember the received Wantlists from other peers until they are cancelled so that if before the requesting node gets the block it is seen by the peer with the Wantlist, it can forward it to the requestor. Thus, receivers of a Wantlist will forward back any of the requested blocks as soon as they have it.Finally, the reception of a block from a Wantlist in the requesting node triggers a CANCEL message to the rest of the nodes the Wantlist was sent to in order to signal them that the block was already received and it is not needed anymore.For me, some of Bitswapxe2x80x99s most pressing limitations are its inefficient use of bandwidth, and the fact that the discovery of blocks is performed blindly (in the sense that Bitswap only talks to its directly connected peers). Fortunately to work around these problems, some extensions to Bitswap have already been proposed and  implemented:The use of additional WANT-HAVE, WANT-BLOCK, and HAVE messages. Flatly requesting blocks from every peer could lead to duplicating the exchange of blocks from many of our connected peers. Instead, we can use these new Bitswap messages to express our desire for a block before actually requesting its transmission. This may increase the number of RTTs required to get a block, but reduces the bandwidth requirements of the protocol.Intelligent peer selection algorithm in sessions. When a node tells us that it has the block we were requesting we add them to a session. Subsequent requests for a specific CID are exchanged with all the nodes in the corresponding session, but this exchange is blindly broadcasted to all of them. To make the protocol more efficient, some proposals have been made to intelligently select the peers in a session to which requests will be broadcasted in order to reduce the number of messages exchanged in the network. Thus, these requests will only be sent to nodes with the xe2x80x9chighest scorexe2x80x9d in the session (i.e. nodes with the highest probability of having the block we are requesting).In Bitswap we can only request a block (or group of blocks in a Wantlist) through their CID. We cannot request a full branch or a full subgraph of a DAG. To solve this, another content exchange protocol similar to Bitswap has been implemented in the IPFS ecosystem, Graphsync. Graphsync leverages the data model of IPLD (standard representation of Merkle DAG structures), and IPLD selectors (a way of performing queries over these structures). Instead of sending flat WANT requests to peers, an IPLD selector is included in the request.. What this selector is specifying is a query over a DAG structure, so instead of asking for specific blocks it is like asking others xe2x80x9chey guys, if someone has any of the blocks fulfilling this query in the DAG please send them to mexe2x80x9d. Smart right? To me, Graphsync is like a \"batch Bitswap request\".The current implementation of Bitswap has already shown impressive results speeding-up the discovery an exchange of content compared to xe2x80x9ctraditionalxe2x80x9d DHT content lookups, or even to centralized infrastructures (I highly recommend reading this post which describes how the teams of IPFS and Netflix leveraged IPFS as a peer-to-peer CDN to let nodes inside Netflixxe2x80x99s infrastructure collaborate and seed common pieces to neighboring nodes, helping make container distribution faster. Incredible, right? And one of the responsibles for this improvements is Bitswap).All of this doesnxe2x80x99t mean that Bitswap can not be further improved. My feeling is that one of the first things we need to do in order to be able to better Bitswapxe2x80x99s current outstanding implementation is to understand what are the overheads of the protocol, and what is preventing us from exchanging content faster in IPFS. It is the discovery of blocks or their actual transmission? Could we devise better ways to store data in the network to ease the content discovery? Even more, we use IPFS for a great gamut of use cases that may require from the exchange of several small files, to the download of large datasets. Does Bitswap perform equally under these scenarios, or should we consider the implementation of a xe2x80x9cuse case-awarexe2x80x9d content exchange algorithm? To this extent, in the next few weeks I am planning to build a test environment to help us answer these questions in order to understand if together, and considering the results of this analysis, we can take Bitswap and file-sharing in P2P networks to its theoretical limit. In short, a lot of exciting things are going on around Bitswap. I could keep writing about this for a few hours more, but I guess it makes more sense to keep this the first part of a series, and periodically share some updates and knowledge pills.

The groupxe2x80x99s mission, the companyxe2x80x99s mission, and my role in the company have all the keywords I would use to search my xe2x80x9cdream jobxe2x80x9d: [xe2x80x9cresearchxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cengineeringxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9ccomputingxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cresilient distributed networksxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cpush humanityxe2x80x9d], and I would add a few more keywords that I feel are implicit in the aforementioned missions: [xe2x80x9cfixing the Internetxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9copen source softwarexe2x80x9d]. Now you start getting my excitement even if you donxe2x80x99t know me, right?To finish putting you in context and help you understand why this is so cool for me, the other day I was having dinner with a really good friend of mine. Wexe2x80x99ve been best friends since high school, so you can imagine that he has endured long hours hearing me talk about my crazy ideas about how the Internet is broken, the urgent need to recover our privacy, the importance of science in society, the benefits of decentralization, and my obsession with self-organizing networks (he is an economist specialized in debt, so he knows nothing about computing, technology, etc.). When I told him the good news he, obviously, didnxe2x80x99t know who Protocol Labs were. I briefly told him about what they do, what is their focus, and what will be my contribution to the company, and his answer was: xe2x80x9cwtf! but that is the kind of company you have been looking to start since high schoolxe2x80x9d.  Again, he knows nothing about technology, he came to this conclusion after years of spamming him on these topics.Now I will take the liberty of directly copy-pasting from the ResNetLabxe2x80x99s site some of the problems they are working on to see if I am able to transmit to you part of my excitement about the hard problems they are working on: The labxe2x80x99s genesis comes from a need present in the IPFS and libp2p  projects to amp their research efforts to tackle the critical challenges of scaling up networks to planet scale and beyond. The Lab is designed  to take ownership of the earlier stages on the research pipeline, from  ideas to specs and to code.Preserve usersxe2x80x99 privacy when providing and fetching content: How to ensure that the userxe2x80x99s of the IPFS network can collect and provide information while maintaining their full anonymity. My feeling is that a consistent solution to this problem could not only be huge for IPFS, but to the overall architecture of the Internet.Mutable data (naming, real-time, guarantees):  Enabling a multitude of different patterns of interactions between  users, machines and both. In other words, what are the essential  primitives that must be provided for dynamic applications to exist, what  are the guarantees they require (consistency, availability,  persistence, authenticity, etc) from the underlying layer in order  create powerful and complete applications in the Distributed Web. The real time guarantees in distributed systems is something I have been looking to explore for a while.Human-readable naming:  You can only have two of three properties for a name: human-meaningful,  secure, decentralized. This is Zookoxe2x80x99s Trilemma. Can we have all 3, or  even more? Can context related to some data help solve this problem?Enhanced bitswap/graphsync with more network smarts:  Bitswap is a simple protocol and it generally works. However, we feel  that its performance can be substantially improved. One of the main  factors that hold performance back is the fact that a node cannot  request a subgraph of the DAG and results in many round-trips in order  to xe2x80x9cwalk downxe2x80x9d the DAG. The current operation of bitswap is also very  often linked to duplicate transmission and receipt of content which  overloads both the end nodes and the network.Routing at scale (1M, 10M, 100M, 1B.. nodes):  Content-addressable networks face the challenge of routing scalability,  as the amount of addressable elements in the network rises by several  orders of magnitude compared to the host-addressable Internet of today. Remember when I mentioned self-organizing networks above? This problem and the next one are quite linked with my crazy ideas around this type of networks, so I canxe2x80x99t wait to see what I face at this end.PubSub at scale (1M, 10M, 100M, 1B.. nodes):  As the IPFS system is evolving and growing, communicating new entries  to the IPNS is becoming an issue due to the increased network and node  load requirements. The expected growth of the system to multiple  millions of nodes is going to create significant performance issues,  which might render the system unusable. Despite the significant amount  of related literature on the topic of pub/sub, very few systems have  been tested to that level of scalability, while those that have been are  mostly cloud-based, managed and structured infrastructures.Source: https://research.protocol.ai/groups/resnetlab/Exciting, right?Source: https://trustos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/This all looks like the perfect story, but I am not going to lie to you, this journey is being quite bittersweet. I am sad to leave my current job at Telefxc3xb3nica and the amazing team of talented individuals I leave there. Donxe2x80x99t get me wrong, in Telefxc3xb3nica I had one of the nearest jobs I could have to my xe2x80x9cdream jobxe2x80x9d in Spain, and in this two years Ixe2x80x99ve had a blast and I havenxe2x80x99t stopped learning. It is not that my job there didnxe2x80x99t have all the ingredients in order for me to achieve professional success, is just that in Protocol Labs I will be able to have the focus towards my goals I am currently looking for to speed this quest. So now you also get why leaving my current job has not been an easy thing (quitting a job you enjoy and that you are comfortable with is never easy). I donxe2x80x99t want to bore you with more personal matters, I know you come every Sunday to this newsletter probably for the tech and not for the gossip. But before I close this personal publication, I want to briefly share some of the things our amazing team in Telefxc3xb3nica managed to achieve in these two years:It all started with the development of a tokenization platform. We wanted to abstract companies and internal units from the complexities of blockchain technology. We wanted to prevent them from having to worry about xe2x80x9cwhere and howxe2x80x9d to issue their tokens (Ethereum?, Hyperledger Fabric?, BigchainDB?, why not all of them?), and having to hire specialized talent (which was lacking at the time, and still is) to build their PoCs. With this system we managed to ease a lot the development of blockchain-based use cases and prototypes (internally and externally), and we saw the development of successful projects (such as Karma) using our technology.With the success of the tokenization platform we became ambitious, and we came up with the concept of TrustOS, which would end up becoming Telefxc3xb3nicaxe2x80x99s blockchain product to xe2x80x9cadd trust into the operations of corporationsxe2x80x9d. TrustOS was included in Telefxc3xb3nicaxe2x80x99s Activation Programme, and many startups and SMEs are already using it through this programme.But all the work behind TrustOS hasnxe2x80x99t been exclusively of product development and integration, it is also the result of long hours of research and development that led to:An exhaustive analysis of performance best practices in Hyperledger Fabric for production networks (the conclusions where shared in a series of publications in this newsletter, and several conferences/meetups).The filing of five different patents, protecting the IP of schemes included in the product in a broad range of fields such as: the management and recovery of blockchain identities leveraging the SIM card and the telco infrastructure; ways of increasing the trust of private blockchain networks and the execution of smart contracts logic; the deployment of federation of blockchain networks; or the development of new consensus algorithms for private blockchain networks.The standardization of a new method of idea generation and collaboration for the team (this is something I havenxe2x80x99t shared yet in this newsletter. Expect a follow-up on this).The participation in several European H2020 Innovation Projects with amazing teams from universities and corporations. Moreover, as part of our work in TrustOS, we also realized the need of  a common decentralized identity framework for authentication and authorization in corporate blockchain networks. It all started as a way of fixing a specific need we had in TrustOS related to identities in general-purpose Fabric networks, but this started growing and being generalized internally up to a point were we felt this could become a full-fledged open source project from which everyone could benefit. This is how TrustID was born, and it became an open source project hosted in the Hyperledger Labs (check the repo).And many many more things that I may have missed in this brief recap of my last two years there (the hackathons wexe2x80x99ve won, the meetups wexe2x80x99ve given, etc.).And I know for sure that this is just the beginning for them, I am really looking forward to see all the successes yet to come for this amazing team in the future (because, letxe2x80x99s be honest, I was definitely the one weighting them down with my crazy ideas ;) ). Thank you for these two really fun and exciting years: @jota_ele_ene, @joobid, @diegoescalonaro, @_mtnieto, @aggcastro, @cesssRC, @carlosalca94.On Monday I start a new exciting professional endeavor without the amazing team from the pic above, letxe2x80x99s see how it goes.

This is why every day we see a new service powered by AI, blockchain or IoT. You just need your personal computer or laptop, an internet connection, maybe access to some of the resources offered by a public cloud provider  to speed your development and you are ready to go. But what about  hardware prototyping? When we talk about hardware, things arenxe2x80x99t that easy, right? You donxe2x80x99t have a pay-as-you go public offer of hardware pieces to test your ideas and iterate over your designs. If every time you want to try a new implementation you need to buy a new piece of hardware or request the manufacture of an ad-hoc ASIC, by the time you are done with your product you may be broke. Especially if  you are approaching a product in an innovative way, without funding and a history of past successes.All software is consumed through hardware, this is something that we must never forget when we are building our product. It may appear that when we talk about innovation in technology like blockchain, AI or IoT, we are exclusively talking about software, but we are disregarding the role of hardware in these advancements. Blockchain is cryptography and distributed systems, but also the hardware miners need to run the consensus, the network infrastructure required to deploy a global network, and what about the implementation of new advancements such as HW VDFs? (something briefly introduced in this newletter); AI is fancy training algorithms (see, for instance, OpenAIxe2x80x99s recent GPT-3, which I am really looking forward to playing with and share with you here) as well as all the hardware for parallel computation and data management that made this field xe2x80x94and the problems it tacklesxe2x80x94 accessible to anyone. And what about IoT? IoT is essentially the co-design of hardware and software.Owning the hardware allows for delivery of the best possible experience. One of the reasons Apple products are so popular is because they deliver a great experience. They do so in large part due to Applexe2x80x99s strategy of vertical integration: a strategy where Apple makes both its software and hardware in-house. Apple designs and develops iOS as well as the A11 processor running in iPads and iPhones.But the importance of Hardware is not only what separates us from stability and a good user experience, in many cases it is directly the reason why a new technology isnxe2x80x99t a reality yet. Take quantum computing as the perfect example. We have been hearing the goodness and potential impact of quantum computing for ages, why donxe2x80x99t we have a brand new quantum computing in our living room yet? Let me give you a hint, hardware. Since the 80s we have been theoretically discovering and improving powerful quantum algorithms that would be able to break the encryption of the internet or find new molecules, but we donxe2x80x99t have the hardware to run them. Engineers all over the world are working hard to provide us with more qubits,  lower error rates, greater connectivity of qubits, and the possibility  of running quantum hardware in friendlier environments xe2x80x94 did you know that the coldest places in the universe are the cryogenic chambers where we run quantum circuits? You are welcome, now you have something to brag about in your next dinner party.UNIVAC I control station, in Museum of Science, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, by Daderot.Fortunately,  if you went back to the 40s or 50s in a time machine and asked experts  about the future of their computers, few would practically project the degree of advances that have been made in processor speed, memory size, data storage size, physical size and ease of use. If you had suggested trying to fit a room-size mainframe in a shoebox, let alone a machine a hundred times more capable, they would have laughed at you, but thatxe2x80x99s the scope of the challenge ahead of us for quantum computers. You see? It all comes to better hardware.And what can we, as ordinary mortals without a PhD and big pockets, do to build innovative products considering the important role of hardware in technology? Fortunately, there are two things that are going to help us in our endeavor to cheaper prototyping and better designs: hardware-software co-design and FPGAs.The core concepts in hardware-software co-design are getting another look, nearly two decades after this approach was first introduced and failed to catch on. Whatxe2x80x99s different this time around is the growing complexity and an emphasis on architectural improvements, as well as device scaling, particularly for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. Software is a critical component, and the more tightly integrated the software, the better, the power and performance. Software also adds an element of flexibility, which is essential in many of these designs because algorithms are in a state of almost constant flux.The initial idea behind co-design was that a single language could be used to describe hardware and software. With a single description, it would be possible to optimize the implementation, partitioning off pieces of functionality that would go into  accelerators, pieces that would be implemented in custom hardware and pieces that would run as software on the processor xe2x80x94 all at the touch of a button (well, or a compiler).And the only piece of hardware that you need for this apart from your laptop, a Field-Programmable Gate Array, or FPGA. FPGAs are a semiconductor IC where a large majority of the electrical  functionality inside the device can be changed; changed by the design engineer, changed during the PCB assembly process, or even changed after  the equipment has been shipped to customers out in the xe2x80x9cfieldxe2x80x9d. So combine an FPGA and the field of software-hardware co-design and not only do you have a way of approaching the design of your full product down-top, but you also have the platform you need for cheap hardware prototyping. Forget about buying and assembling brand new pieces for every iteration of your product and adapting your software to it, with this set-up the only thing you would need to test a new version of your implementation is re-programming the FPGA xe2x80x94 just like with software.I know hardware is not as sexy as software, but I feel it is key for the future of technology. If youxe2x80x99ll allow me to make a confession, I am an electrical engineer by training that felt in love with software along the way, so the idea of making hardware as xe2x80x9caccessiblexe2x80x9d as software, and give everyone the capability of building a hardware system as easily as we now build software systems excites me greatly, and is a field I am really looking to explore.

The only thing preventing us from higher transaction throughputs and more resilient blockchain systems are better consensus algorithms, right? Well, unfortunately, this is only partially true. All these mechanisms require of the use of an underlying messaging protocol to communicate with the rest of the (unstructured) network, and orchestrate the operation of the consensus algorithm and any other overlaying scheme the system may have. Thus, in order to have a resilient and high performant consensus algorithm, we first need a resilient and high performant messaging protocol.If I asked you what is the underlying messaging protocol used in Bitcoin or Ethereum, would you be able to answer? Until last week, I wouldnxe2x80x99t have been able to give an accurate answer either. We all have a general intuition, but many of us disregard this important component in blockchain platforms.In case you were wondering, Bitcoin uses a flooding algorithm to spread new transactions and blocks to the rest of the network. In a flooding algorithm, nodes broadcast new messages to every other node connected in the network. This ensures that messages propagate as fast as possible while adding traffic redundancy. Ethereumxe2x80x99s current messaging protocol is a bit more xe2x80x9cbandwidth efficientxe2x80x9d than Bitcoinxe2x80x99s flooding. Instead of every node broadcasting messages to every other connected peer in the network, they randomly select sqrt(N) nodes to broadcast the message to, reducing a bit the traffic redundancy and bandwidth requirements of the system.As practically shown for years in the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, these protocols xe2x80x9ckind of work finexe2x80x9d. But could we envision better messaging protocols for next-generation blockchain and p2p networks? Fortunately, we have a new good candidate for this, say hello to GossipSub.GossipSub is a brand new pubsub protocol proposal designed and implemented in libp2p. The aim of this new protocol is to enhance many of the limitations of existing pubsub and messaging protocols in unstructured networks (high bandwidth requirements, no delivery guarantees, high delivery latency, no mitigation schemes against potential attacks, etc.). GossipSub, and specifically GossipSub-v1.1, has been designed to incorporate reliance against a wide spectrum of attacks, ensuring fast message delivery. So how does GossipSub work? The main focus of GossipSub is to deliver messages to all the nodes in the network subscribed to a certain topic. To achieve this, two overlay networks are built over the underlying p2p unstructured network: (i) a full-message peering mesh where a small number of nodes are connected using bidirectional links conforming a local mesh (the number of nodes to be included in the local mesh is determined by the degree of the network. This parameter controls the trade-off between speed, reliability, resilience and efficiency of the network); (ii) and a metadata-only network conformed by every peer in the network. This network is made up of all the network connections between peers that arenxe2x80x99t full-message peerings.Source: Libp2p Pub/sub DocumentationThe local mesh (full-message network) is conformed by nodes subscribed to the same topics (this is the way nodes choose what peers to add to their local mesh). Thus, when a peer subscribes to a topic, it selects some peers to become its full-message peers for that topic. In parallel, nodes in the global mesh (metadata network) use a gossipping algorithm to share information with the rest of the peers inside and outside their local mesh about things that are happening in the network. Hence, gossip messages include information about the subscription and unsubscription of connected nodes, recent messages seen in the network, etc. Source: Libp2p Pub/sub DocumentationWhen a peer wants to publish a message, it sends a copy to all full-message peers it is connected to; and when a peer receives a new message from another peer, it stores the message and forwards a copy to all other full-message peers. Peers remember a list of recently seen messages. This let them act upon a message only the first time they see it and ignore retransmissions of already seen messages (avoiding duplicate bandwidth). Gossip messages propagate metadata throughout the network. Gossips are emitted to a random subset of peers that may or may not be part of the mesh, and they are used, for instance, to inform other peers about messages seen and that they may have missed.Source: GossipSub paperAdditionally, GossipSub-v1.1 includes schemes to avoid a wide-range of attacks to the protocol. Every node keeps a score of every other peer it interacts with. Scores are private, and are never shared with other nodes (conforming a local view of the network from a specific node). The score function is used as a performance monitoring mechanism to identify and remove badly-behaving nodes from the mesh. It is computed using a set of interesting parameters from their counterparts such as the time a node has been part of the mesh, its rate of message delivery and failures, the number of invalid messages exchanged, etc. This score is the foundation of many of the protection schemes introduced in GossipSub-v1.1 such as opportunistic grafting and adaptive gossip dissemination. In the sake of brevity, I will refer you to the recently released pre-print of GossipSubxe2x80x99s paper if you want to have a deeper understanding of its operation and design rationale. Even more, in this same announcement, an extensive evaluation report of the performance and security of the protocol (which I honestly had a blast reading), and the results of its security audit have also been released. In short, awesome references to imbibe all the knowledge around this awesome piece of tech.And itxe2x80x99s time to get practical! You can find the implementation and specs of GossipSub in libp2p in case you want to start playing with it, or directly use it in your next application. But if the only thing you want to see is GossipSub in action in a simple network without having to worry about hacking anything, I built a simple tool to help you with this that I called xe2x80x9cThe PubSub Playgroundxe2x80x9d. With this tool you will be able to easily deploy a local GossipSub network and watch how messages flow through the network while collecting interesting metrics.To run the tool you just need to clone the repo and run the following commands:With this simple command you will set up a network with your desired number of publishers and subscribers. Every publisher node will periodically publish messages into a topic with the same ID of his PeerID, while subscribers randomly subscribe to one of the available topics, and read the messages sent by the topic's corresponding publisher.Throughout the run every node will collect data from the execution of GossipSub, and trace its local view of the exchange of messages with the rest of the network. All these traces are used to generate a set of metrics that can be checked in two ways:By enabling the -log flag in the execution of the tool to periodically print metrics in stdout.By using the -server flag that starts an HTTP Server and runs a WebSocket at ws://127.0.0.1/websocket so that anyone can subscribe to the socket and receive updates of the metrics collected in the network. Along with the websocket, a simple dashboard is provided at http://localhost:3000 so you can visually evaluate the evolution of your network metrics.The implementation of this tool has been great to help me understand how GossipSub works and behaves under the hood with networks of different sizes. With the PubSub Playground we are able to draw conclusions about the behavior of the protocol such as:The type of messages exchanged in a GossipSub network, and the amount of them required to deliver messages to subscribers according to the size of the network.The behavior of the load of the network according to the number of publishers and subscribers.Realize how the average delay of message delivery behaves, and understand how this metrics changes over time (from boot to stability).See the average delay of messages from publishers to subscribers, and the rate of xe2x80x9cusefulxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9ccontrolxe2x80x9d messages in the system.And there are still a bunch of other things I could add to drive our analysis further like:Dynamically set the number of publishers and subscribers (so we can add new nodes with the network running) and play with the network churn.Enable the publication and subscription to more than one topic for peers.Set additional delays and latencies in node connections to see how this affects the protocol.One that I am really looking forward to start exploring (but havenxe2x80x99t got the time to tackle): use all the data collected to draw a heat map that show (in real time?) how messages flow and are exchanged between the different nodes in the network. This would allow us to draw conclusions about xe2x80x9chot linksxe2x80x9d between nodes, observe the formation of the local meshes, understand the bandwidth supported by links, etc.And I would also love to start adding rogue nodes to the tool so we can setup and visualize the behaviour of the protocol when the network is under attack (as showed in GossipSubxe2x80x99s evaluation report).And nothing else from my part, this was all for today. I would love to hear your thoughts about this simple project, and I hope you are as excited as me with the work being done around GossipSub and other brand new networking protocols for the next-generation of the Internet.

This list has already over 30 items, but it was already Thursday afternoon and I couldnxe2x80x99t find the motivation (nor the time) to write about any of them, so I chose to make a Twitter call to see if any of my followers could suggest a topic I felt a bit more excited to write about with the time I had.It was then when my good friend @koke0117 mentioned Deno. Actually, it had been a few weeks since I started reading and playing around with Deno, so I opened my text editor and started writing. July 2nd 2020So what exactly is Deno? xe2x80x9cDeno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.xe2x80x9d Started by Node.js creator, Ryan Dahl, it is an attempt to fix many of the current issues of Node.js while accommodating to the new trends and advancements in Javascript from the last ten years. This talk of Ryan at JSConf EU illustrates perfectly some of the reasons why he chose to start a new Javascript runtime project. Some of the things he mentions in the talk that would have done differently now if he were to redesign Node are related with the node_modules, Node.jsxe2x80x99 security, and the ability to run code in the browser and in the server.As result of these concerns, Deno was born. Letxe2x80x99s go through some of the new features introduced by Deno:(i) Secure by default. Deno runs your code in a secure sandbox by default, so you will have to give explicit permissions to your code if you want to access files, the network, or the environment you are running on. Letxe2x80x99s see what happens if we want to run this simple script that fetchs data from an API:If we run this using xe2x80x9cdeno run test.tsxe2x80x9d we get the following:Our script doesnxe2x80x99t have to permission to access the network. We need to explicitly grant him with the required permissions running xe2x80x9cdeno run --allow-net test.tsxe2x80x9d. Pretty sweet, right?(ii) Top level await compatibility, and Typescript support out of the box. Havenxe2x80x99t you seen anything weird in the code I shared above? I WAS USING AN AWAIT OUT OF AN ASYNC FUNCTION. This is another of Denoxe2x80x99s cool features. Forget about having to explicitly resolve promises using .then() when you canxe2x80x99t wrap the code inside an async function, Deno has you covered. The same way it has you covered if you want to use Typescript. In my previous example I didnxe2x80x99t have to compile my .ts file to run it, Deno directly knew how to do this for me.(iii) And one of the features most loved by some and really hated by others, no need for NPM and the node_modules folder anymore. Deno moves from centralized package managers (npm or yarn) to the use of a decentralized approach where dependencies are imported using ES6 imports and the url address of the source code repository (the Golang way! Actually I am a bit biased because I love Go, so I wonxe2x80x99t comment further about this). In previous posts, I already warned about the risks of centralized package managers, but if you want to read a bit more about this, check this post. To test this new approach to dependencies you can run this example and see how the dependency is downloaded and made available to you in your local cache:(iv) Deno ships software as a single executable file, and this is really convenient, as it produces a dependency-less single file from your code. You can, for instance, run xe2x80x9cdeno bundle test.ts test.jsxe2x80x9d in the previous example to see the magic happen.(v) Built-in utilities and (audited) standard modules. Deno ships many of the things I love about Go such as xe2x80x9cdeno fmtxe2x80x9d for code formatting and xe2x80x9cdeno infoxe2x80x9d for dependency inspection. Moreover, deno has a standard library with many useful functionalities to remove the need of external unknown dependencies.(vi) Finally, Deno is compatible with xe2x80x9cthe browserxe2x80x9d (Denoxe2x80x99s API should be compatible in the browser), and it supports the execution of Web Assembly (yay! and you know this is something I love).If you want to start playing with Deno and try the examples shared above, the first thing we need to do is to install it. There are several ways of doing this, being my favorites the use of their provided install script:Or if you have Rust installed, and as Deno is written in Rust, cargo installing it:Remember to export Denoxe2x80x99s path to use it directly from your CLI. To see if your installation has been successful, you can run the following command: Youxe2x80x99ll see how deno downloads every required dependency and runs the welcome typescript file xf0x9fxa6x95.A cool second example to test in Deno, is to run a web server using its standard library (it is the example suggested in their official site).With this simple piece of code you will see may of the new features of Deno in action. I know Node.js already supports the execution of WASM binaries, but this was another thing I wanted try in Deno. There are several tutorials out there that guide you on how to build your Web Assembly binary from Rust or Golang and run it in Deno. All of my past approaches to WASM have been using Rust, so this time I chose to go with Golang, see what happens.My first impression was that the integration WASM-Go is not as straightforward as with Rust (I havenxe2x80x99t figured out yet how to compile to WASM a function with parameters from Go and run it and passing the arguments from JS, but we are here to talk about Deno, more about this in future posts).This is the simple program I am going to compile into WASM:To compile it we just need to run the compiler with the following options:To run it from JS we first copy an auxiliary file used to load WASM from JS (I guess this file makes the interfacing work of the automatically generated JS files you get when compiling WASM in Rust). We copy this file in our projectxe2x80x99s root:And write the JS script that will run the WASM binary:This script loads the binary from our local environment and runs it. When running it we have to remember to give access permissions to file within Deno. Thus:And there you go, we have our WASM binary running within Deno.I donxe2x80x99t think Deno will replace Node.js, and probably many wonxe2x80x99t even switch to Deno for a single project, but for those of use more comfortable with typed programming languages, and psyched with the future of WASM, I feel Deno is a step forward the future of Javascript, as it introduces by design many features that in Node.js require a significant overhead if you want to use modern Javascript (I am thinking about Typescript compilation, bundles, and top level await support). Adding to this the improvements in security, it poses in Deno a really interesting alternative to Node.js in the long run. But this my humble and probably biased opinion, I would love to hear your thoughts about Deno.PS: I highly recommend this post as a complementary view of the role and future of Deno in the ecosystem.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"@adlrocha - Deno, the new dino in town - @adlrocha Weekly Newsletter","url":"https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-deno-the-new-dino-in-town"}

And more so since the last time I wrote about cryptography in this newsletter (my last publications related to cryptography were my tutorial to Zokrates and the ZKP Game). Today I will share my notes of the brief research I did on a concept Ixe2x80x99ve been hearing about for a while now and which is being widely explored by projects in the crypto space: Verifiable Delay Functions.Disclaimer: This publication may end up being pretty unstructured as it is the result of the transcription of the notes I took in my xe2x80x9cnon-digitalxe2x80x9d notebook while researching VDFs. Ixe2x80x99ll do my best. xe2x80x9cVerifiable Delay Functions are a way to slow things down verifiablyxe2x80x9d. This is the most illustrative definition of VDFs Ixe2x80x99ve seen (is from this awesome talk, by the way). But why would we want to slow things down? What is the purpose for these brand new primitives? The answer is randomness.Finding randomness on the blockchain is hard. Smart contract executions must be deterministic, but for certain applications a bit of randomness may come handy. To achieve this developers try to acquire sources of randomness from information in the network such as future block hashes, block difficulty, or timestamps. Unfortunately, all these schemes have a key limitation: everyone can observe how the choices they make affect the randomness generated on-chain. In this article you have a few examples of vulnerable implementations of randomness using block information as sources of entropy.Along with smart contracts, randomness is also important for other critical parts in the operation of blockchain systems such as the election of leaders in proof-of-stakes protocols:xe2x80x9cAnother related problem is electing leaders and validators in proof of  stake protocols. In this case it turns out that being able to influence  or predict randomness allows a miner to affect when they will be chosen to mine a block. There are a wide variety of techniques for overcoming this issue, such as Ouroborosxe2x80x99s  verifiable secret-sharing scheme. However, they all suffer from the same pitfall: a non-colluding honest majority must be present.xe2x80x9dWith these problems in mind, Boneh, et al. introduced the concept of verifiable delay functions (VDFs) in 2018.xe2x80x9cVDFs are functions that require a moderate amount of sequential computation to evaluate, but once a solution is found, it is easy for anyone to verify that it is correct.xe2x80x9dVDFs introduce a forced time delay to an output so that malicious actors canxe2x80x99t influence it by predicting future values. A valid VDF must have the following properties:Sequential: Anyone can compute f(x) in t sequential steps, but no adversary with a large number of processors can distinguish the output of f(x) from random in significantly fewer steps. This is really important if we want to tackle the problems mentioned above. A malicious actor shouldnxe2x80x99t be able to distinguish the output from an intermediate state in the computation of the VDF giving him advantage over xe2x80x9cwhat comes nextxe2x80x9d.Efficiently verifiable: Given the output y, any observer can verify that y = f(x) in a short amount of time (specifically log(t)).And an interesting note from this article about VDFs. Why a hash chain canxe2x80x99t be considered a VDF?xe2x80x9cBefore jumping into VDF constructions, letxe2x80x99s examine why an xe2x80x9cobviousxe2x80x9d  but incorrect approach to this problem fails. One such approach would be  repeated hashing. If the computation of some hash function h takes t  steps to compute, then using f = h(h(...h(x))) as a VDF  would certainly satisfy the sequential requirement above. Indeed, it  would be impossible to speed this computation up with parallelism since  each application of the hash depends entirely on the output of the  previous one. However, this does not satisfy the efficiently verifiable  requirement of a VDF. Anyone trying to verify that f(x) = y  would have to recompute the entire hash chain. We need the evaluation  of our VDF to take exponentially more time to compute than to verify.xe2x80x9dSo what would be a good candidate for a VDF? Letxe2x80x99s follow the example from here. The specific VDF that we are going to build is an operation over a finite group of unknown order (i.e. over a set of numbers with a clear upper limit and a specific number of elements which is unknown). A good way of building a finite group is defining all operations over a set of numbers modulo N (where N can be something as fancy as the multiplication of two safe primes p and q).With that in mind, our VDF could be represented as the following function:Where x is the input value, hashed into the group, T is the publicly known delay parameter and determines the duration of the delay, and y is the output. We are operating over the finite group, so we will drop the modulo N from now on (consider it implied).With this construction, this simple function already fulfills one of the basic properties required for it to become a valid VDF candidate, it is sequential. At every step in the computation we need the previous operation for the next iteration as we donxe2x80x99t know the order of the group, making it serial. To compute x^2^T we will have to compute sequentially x^2^i with i from zero to T, as in every step we need to make sure that the result falls inside our finite the gorup. This is also the reason why we say T is the delay function, we need T steps to get the final output.xe2x80x9cThe repeated squaring computation is not parallelizable and reveals  nothing about the end result until the last squaring. These properties are both due to the fact that we do not know the order of G. That knowledge would allow attackers to use group theory based attacks to speed up the computation.xe2x80x9dOk, so we have a sequential function, now we need to make it efficiently verifiable so that a verifier doesnxe2x80x99t need to follow the full T steps again. This can be done by building a proof. For this example, the prover and the verifier will run an interactive protocol to perform the validation of the VDF.To prove the VDF, the verifier needs to pick a random number, L, and send it to the prover. Now the prover divides 2^T by L to get the quotient q and the remainder r. He computes x^q and send it along y to the verifier.The verifier now computes (2^T) mod L and checks that y is equal to (x^q)^L*x^r. If this is the case then it means that, indeed, the verifier has full knowledge of the output of the VDF and therefore has xe2x80x9csufferedxe2x80x9d the computation of the T steps. Lets summarize the interactive protocol here for clarity purposes:And voilxc3xa1! VDF execution verified. This proof could also be built and verified using a non-interactive proof, but an external source of randomness would be required.There are several VDF candidates out there since Bonehxe2x80x99s proposal:xe2x80x9cThere are currently three candidate constructions that satisfy the VDF requirements. Each one has its own potential downsides. The first was outlined in the original VDF paper  by Boneh, et al. and uses injective rational maps. However, evaluating  this VDF requires a somewhat large amount of parallel processing,  leading the authors to refer to it as a xe2x80x9cweak VDF.xe2x80x9d Later, Pietrzak and Wesolowski independently arrived at extremely similar constructions based on repeated squaring in groups of unknown order.xe2x80x9dBut the best resource without a doubt to learn about everything that is happening around VDFs is VDF research. I wish I had the time to read and watch all the impressive content included in this site (I would become an expert in VDFs :) ). Here you will find the latests papers, talks and a lot of wonderful knowledge about this field. Below you can see a figure of many subfields of VDFs.Actually one of the fields that has ended up interesting me the most (after a glance in the content of VDF research) is the co-design hardware-software of VDFs. A good example of it can be found in this talk:So you want to see VDFs in action, right? The easiest way Ixe2x80x99ve found is to use this repo which includes a Rust implementation of Bonehxe2x80x99s VDF. First you need to install the tool as follows (be sure to have Rust installed in your machine before approaching these steps): With the tool installed, your are now able to run the VDF:And verify its execution by pasting the output into the command as follows:A cool thing to try (if you have the time) is to increase the delay parameter (that we set to 100 in the above example) to something high such as 10000, and see how computing the VDF takes a significant amount of time, while verifying the result is performed almost instantly. But this is what VDFs are all about, right?I still have a lot to learn about this cryptographic primitives and their potential use, but this first contact with them has been pretty fun. See you next week! Finally, I leave you two interesting videos that will definitely explain better than me what VDFs are all about.

Imagine that you want to build a proxy server for you system using your favorite programming language, what do you do? First you choose the web framework you are more comfortable with so you have a scaffolding for the project and you can get started with the implementation straightaway. With this simple step, you have a way of launching a server and receiving HTTP requests out of the box. In your server, you want to authenticate requests and filter traffic according to its source address and the content of the body. Hence, along with your webserver framework, you choose to install a middleware to handle authentication, and a library to ease the processing and filtering of new requests (when are we, in the 90s? You are not going to reinvent the wheel and develop all of this on your own, you want to have your system running in production in two or three days). You stick all these pieces together with a bit of glue code, drop some unit and integration tests to see that everything is working , and you are ready to go. Source: https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance (credits to Lin Clark).You know the problem of the aforementioned approach? Your project ends up being 80% other peoplexe2x80x99s code from external libraries leveraged by your project (see above image), 20% your own code (and some xe2x80x9cinspirationxe2x80x9d from StackOverflow), serving your own code as the glue and coarse customization to make the libraries work as desired for your use case. This way of proceeding is a growing trend, and donxe2x80x99t get me wrong, if what you are building is a well-known technology, or an auxiliary system such as your personal CMS, or an internal reporting system, way to go, you will have something up and running in no time, and you will start benefiting from all the goodness of your system ASAP. The problem really arises when you keep following this approach for critical systems, or the core implementations of your tech companyxe2x80x99s platform used by million of users. And believe me, this is being the case in companies of all sizes (ask about they type of projects being carried out by consultancy companies, and the manpower dedicated to them xe2x80x9470% recent graduates). Software development has been really influenced by the xe2x80x9cmove fast, break thingsxe2x80x9d philosophy.  And this is great, I completely agree with testing new ideas early, iterating fast to validate your concept, and be as xe2x80x9cleanxe2x80x9d as possible in your development. Software prototyping is cheap, so why not? This is what innovation is all about, right? The problem arises when you start shipping your great projects and awesome ideas, and they start breaking in production harming your users. Even Facebook realized that it was time to move from the xe2x80x9cmove fast, break thingsxe2x80x9d approach to the  xe2x80x9cmove fast but with stable infraxe2x80x9d. You would never expect a civil engineer to deliver his bridge (a critical infrastructure) as xe2x80x9cfinishedxe2x80x9d after a few tweaks from his proof of concept. Even more, bridges and civil engineering projects are designed to last, why can we also design software for it to last? Correctly designing a bridge takes time and a good understanding of what is happening under the hood (materials, structures, resiliency, etc.). If we want software engineering to be considered an engineering practice (as it deserves) we need to start building robust, resilient and long-lasting systems, and stop dropping any piece of code we come across into our project. Of course, and I apologize for the extreme generalization, I am not saying ALL software is sloppy, I read the other day this article about software engineering in SpaceX, and I literally loved how they use hardware-software redundancy to minimize potential bugs in a system as critical as a space shuttle. I am just saying letxe2x80x99s all be a bit more like space shuttle software engineers.Someone also recounted their interaction with the SpaceX team at GDC 2015xe2x81x842016 in an answer on StackExchange.  They talk about the triple redundancy system and how SpaceX uses the  Actor-Judge system. In short there are 3 dual core ARM processors  running on custom board (according to elteto).  For each decision a xe2x80x9cflight stringxe2x80x9d compares the result from each core  on a single processor. If the output matches the command is sent to  different controllers. There are 3 processors (with dual cores) so that  means each controller/sensor will get three different commands. The  controllers then act as the judge and compare the three commands. If all  three are in agreement, they carry out the operation. If even a single  command is in disagreement, the controller carries out the command from  the processor which had previously been sending the correct commands.This means that at any given point there are 6 running processes of the flight software.Source: https://yasoob.me/posts/software_engineering_within_spacex_launch/And all this thinking is what brought me to the decision of trying to detox a bit from external dependencies to see if it improved my performance and the quality of my code (and the trigger for this publication).Of course, I am not advocating to stop using external dependencies all along and start implementing everything from scratch. That would be nuts! What I am saying is to dispense with all those that are not strictly necessary. For instance, why using a Go web framework when Goxe2x80x99s http standard library gives you all that you need to build an awesome web server? (I completely agree with this guy). This is the perfect example of a practice I used to follow a few years ago when I started building my first Go REST APIs, and something I have completely dropped by now. This is an example of what I mean by xe2x80x9cstop abusing dependenciesxe2x80x9d. I didnxe2x80x99t need the web framework. Yes, it significantly sped my development at the beginning, but not knowing what was happening under the hood, and not having the complete control of what I was doing when facing a bug or wanting to improve the systemxe2x80x99s performance was really messing with my OCD (as I briefly mentioned here).Using a framework feels like driving a new fast car for a while until it breaks down on you many miles down and you have no idea how to fix it.There are core dependencies that I would never ever suggest you remove from your list of xe2x80x9cfrequently usedxe2x80x9d, as it would be suicidal to write their functionality from scratch for your project (as they are the result of hours and hours of development by teams of extremely talented individuals). Take a few examples I have been using lately for my systems such as libp2p, the Geth client, Polkadot, or Qiskit (ok, you may see from the libraries I chose that I am bit biased :) ). I would have been dead if I had to go without them for my implementations.  Of course, if you need to build a p2p network I wouldnxe2x80x99t ask you to rewrite libp2p. If you need xe2x80x9csomething elsexe2x80x9d from it, is open source, so you can always go to the guts, and suggest additions. The same would apply for Qiskit if you need to play around with quantum computing. They all have awesome development teams and researchers working on making the most out of their product, so as long as you know what you are doing, and why you are using them (bearing in mind the potential overheads you may incur in by using them), go for it.So my point is that is not that much xe2x80x9cstop using external dependenciesxe2x80x9d but xe2x80x9cuse them intelligentlyxe2x80x9d. Donxe2x80x99t be lazy and use a poorly maintained JSON parsing library if you already know how to unmarshal and parse JSON using the available functionalities of your preferred programming language. You will avoid unnecessary overheads and trouble. The same way that instead of using the first library you find that xe2x80x9cdoes the workxe2x80x9d, you should invest some time on researching the alternatives in order to choose the one that better suits your needs, or even completely dropping the idea of using a library for the task and writing your own (the same way a civil engineer would do a thorough analysis of the materials and foundations required for his bridge).Letxe2x80x99s move to the reasons that have led me to these conclusions, and why I am trying not to overuse external dependencies. Using libraries have risks that you should, at least, be aware of.The libraries and external dependencies you use may be outdated, under maintained, or/and have hidden security flaws and performance bottlenecks. When you are the owner of the code you xe2x80x9ckind ofxe2x80x9d know what you are doing, but the moment you use code from somewhere else you donxe2x80x99t know if the developer made a mistake (as long as your donxe2x80x99t read and understand the code you are adding to your project). You donxe2x80x99t know if he is using an inefficient implementation, or if he added malicious code if you donxe2x80x99t inspect the source code. Even more, what if the library is abandoned by developers and you need to rely on it for your future system? It all comes down to understanding the code you are using. The next paragraph is the perfect illustration of the risks of using external dependencies:Attackers often use social engineering to get their package into  applications. They create a package that has useful features, and then  sneak in some malicious code. Once the code is in the app and the user  starts up the app, the code can attack the user.This is how a hacker stole $1.5 million worth of cryptocurrency (and almost $13 million more) from users, starting in March of this year.Day 0 (March 6): The attacker published a module to npm:  electron-native-notify. This seemed usefulxe2x80x94it helped Electron apps fire  off native notifications in a way that worked across platforms. It  didnxe2x80x99t have any malicious code in it, yet.Day 2: To pull of the heist, the attacker has to get this module  into the cryptocurrency app. The vector they choose is a dependency in  an application that helps users manage their cryptocurrency, the Agama  Wallet.Day 17: The attacker adds the malicious payload.Day 41-66: The app is rebuilt, pulling in the most recent version  of the dependency, and electron-native-notify with it. At this point, it  starts sending userxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cseedsxe2x80x9d (username/password combos) to a server.  The attacker can then use these seeds to empty usersxe2x80x99 wallets.Day 90: A user alerts npm to suspicious behavior in  electron-native-notify, and they notify the cryptocurrency platform,  which moved funds from vulnerable wallets to a secure one.Extracted from: https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/announcing-the-bytecode-allianceAnd there are tons of examples like this that illustrates the risks of using libraries indiscriminately (do a quick search to see how this can happen).Libraries can significantly increase the size and compilation times of your code. This awesome blog post illustrates vividly the problem in Rust. I highly recommend its reading. You may have probably faced the scenario in which you include a full library to perform some task when, in the end, you are using a single function of the whole library (with the subsequent overhead it poses). Or what about all those dependencies you included in your package.json while developing and experimenting with your solution and that you forgot to clean? All this adds up against you.Libraries may hide from you many of the trade-offs, design decisions and potential points of failure in your solution. When you completely design and implement all the base code of your system, it is easier for you to identify potential attack vectors than if you delegate this trust to a diversified bunch of external dependencies. Finally, not using any library in your system is challenging and fun. Of course, this is not a compelling reason, but even if you donxe2x80x99t agree with me I recommend you approach your design like this at least once in a lifetime. Youxe2x80x99ll see how much you learn in the process; how you better your skills and understanding on your chosen programming language; and how refreshing it is to be completely in control and clearly understand what your system is doing under the hood at all times. What can I say, I was the kind of kid who took apart his grandfatherxe2x80x99s radio to understand how did it work.We need to start building resilient software. This is a trend that we are increasingly realizing now in the field of smart contracts and distributed systems. In this type of systems tons of users in the network share and execute the same base code. So a software failure or a security flaw doesnxe2x80x99t affect exclusively an individualxe2x80x99s infrastructure, but everyone in the system. A lot of cases have been reported of smart contract failures costing millions of dollars,  and bugs in clientxe2x80x99s software harming their systems. We rely more and more in software in everything around us, from buying groceries to chatting to our family and friends. The same way we donxe2x80x99t want our car to be flawed and crash in our next trip, we shouldnxe2x80x99t tolerate software failing in certain scenarios. Updating a library shouldnxe2x80x99t disrupt your system, and a piece software should be designed (as far as possible) the same way bridges are designed, considering that they should be able to be running in the wild for years without the need of any external management or maintenance. Should we embark in the writing of a Resilient Software Manifesto? I donxe2x80x99t know about this, but letxe2x80x99s open the matter to debate. In the meantime, I would love to hear your thoughts.xe2x80xa6 that are going to help me make my point.Software Disenchantment. If you have to choose one of the readings from this list let it be this one. It perfectly complements my point (and I found it at the end of my writing process so I couldnxe2x80x99t add many of the concepts in my discussion).

I force myself to develop the project using the new technologies I want to learn so in the process I end up with a brand new side project and a whole bunch of new skills. The financial dashboard was an excuse to learn GraphQL and ReactJS (to be honest, since then Ixe2x80x99ve been actively using ReactJS more and more, so it paid off). Today I am going to share my xe2x80x9cexcusexe2x80x9d to sharpen my skills on libp2p and concurrent programming in Go (with goroutines, waitgroups, locks, the usual): an IPFS crawler built in libp2p.Itxe2x80x99s no secret by now that Ixe2x80x99m fascinated by p2p, distributed technologies, and their future (and not so future) impact in the architecture of the Internet and society in general. One day I was thinking about how it would work to deploy a p2p network to orchestrate in production all the devices in a federation of data center when I realized something: data center infrastructures are highly monitored in order to detect any minimal deviation from the baseline operation of the system. In traditional (and centralize) infrastructures analytics are xe2x80x9csimplexe2x80x9d, you can have a central monitoring system to collect every single metric from your infrastructure, because you are the owner and manager of it. But when you have a decentralized system owned by several entities where you only operate a small part of the network, how can you monitor its overall status and ensure that the systems is working as it should? You only keep a local view of the network, and you want to learn about the status of the full network. Monitoring and analytics in distributed, unstructured, and self-organizing networks is hard, especially without a centralized infrastructure to orchestrate everything. So with the excuse of deepening on concurrency and libp2p (and triggered by some external circumstances), I decided to start exploring this problem on a small scale.I chose to start small but ambitious. I wanted to explore the problem in a real network, so setting up an 8 nodes network in my local machine in order to experiment would have been cheating. So I decided that I was going to try and collect some metrics from one of the largest p2p networks out there, IPFS. Specifically, I was going to try to monitor the total number of nodes active in the network, and its daily churn (a ratio of the number of nodes that have left throughout the day). A first search on the problem showed several results of academic papers attempting to map the IPFS network, and existing implementations of libp2p network crawlers. So others had already approached this problem before. It was my turn now to see if I managed to follow their steps.Enough with the preambles I took a blank page of my notebook, I started doodling a potential design for my tool, and I ended up with the following architecture for my crawler:The crawler would be conformed by three distinct processes: the crawler process (in charge of random walking the DHT in search of connected nodes xe2x80x94more on this in a momentxe2x80x94); a liveliness process (responsible for checking if the nodes already seen where still alive); and the reporting process (outputting the current state of the analysis, nothing fancy). To crawl the network I chose a pretty unstructured scheme, a random walk of the routing DHT. Crawlers would chose a random node ID and it would ask the network xe2x80x9chey, guys! give me a list of the x nearest nodes to this folkxe2x80x9d. The crawler would then try to make an ephemeral connection to these nodes to see if they are up, and if they are add them to the list of active nodes in the network. In this way we xe2x80x9crandomly traversexe2x80x9d the network in search of active nodes. I could maybe have used a more structured search where instead of choosing a new node ID randomly I took all the peers from my k-buckets, see if they were alive, request a list of peers from the k-buckets to these nodes and so on recursively. My first implementation followed this scheme. It may have ended up being more accurate, but it felt slower than the random approach.The random walk searched for active nodes in the network, but I required a way of checking if these nodes were still alive or if they had left the network. This is the purpose of the liveliness process. This process is dead simple, while the crawler searches and updates the list of active nodes, this process loops through the list of active nodes and tries to make ephemeral connections with them to see if they are still alive.Finally, the reporting process just takes the stored metrics and periodically shows them. Initially, the only metrics I collect from seen nodes are: the moment it was last seen, and if it is behind a NAT or not. This last metric is pretty important to check if a node is still alive, because even if the ephemeral connection fails it may be because he is behind a NAT and not because he is out. So thatxe2x80x99s why we need to know beforehand in the node is behind a NAT in order to know how to identify leaving nodes.You can find the code for the tool in this repository: https://github.com/adlrocha/go-libp2p-crawler. The README file includes some information about the design decision and the implementation, but if you are just curious to see the tool working you can clone the repo, compile the code and run it to see the magic happen:The -crawler and -liveliness flags let you choose the number of goroutines dedicated to searching new nodes, and checking if nodes are still alive, respectively.For those of you who want to know a bit more about how I implemented this tool, let me walk you through its implementation:The first thing the system does when starting up is starting a new libp2p node for each crawler process that wants to be started up. These nodes then connect to the IPFS bootstrap nodes. When a node has been bootstrapped it start searching for new nodes.A node can run only the crawler process or it can run the crawler and liveliness process simultaneously according to the number of crawlers and liveliness chosen for the execution (bear in mind that crawler nodes are designed so that they canxe2x80x99t be only performing liveliness checks, so you can never have more liveliness workers than crawler workers. This is a design choice and could be easily modified).To store the data about nodes seen, actives nodes in the network, etc. I chose to use LevelDB. The system has several goroutines writing in the same data storage, so using LevelDB was a pretty straightforward way of avoiding data races. After some initial tests, I also chose to use locks in order to explicitly remove any potential data races.The reporting process only shows information about the number of nodes seen and that have left today, the number of active nodes in the network (at least our view of it), and the daily churn. I am also storing information about when was the node last seen, and if he is behind a NAT so I could also compute the rate of nodes behind a NAT, or a rough estimate of the average time a node stays connected. I also thought about exploring other metrics such as the average RTT with the rest of the network, the available transports in the seen nodes, and other interesting metrics about the network, but I chose to focus on simple metrics for the moment (crawling was hard enough to be worth the endeavor).Sample execution of the toolAfter long executions of the tool I started experiencing how the number of total nodes leaving the network was being restarted when reaching ~500. This bug was really messing with me, I did several isolated tests to the counters, to all the goroutines independently, until I chose to make an alternative implementation without LevelDB (that you can find in the branch feature/noLevelDB of the repo). With this alternative implementation the problem was solved and, you know what was happening? The structure I used to store the data, and the fact that in the liveliness process I had to make use of an iterator to loop throughout the data was messing with the synchronization. I was accounting for additional nodes and restarting counters when I shouldnxe2x80x99t. Another reason why I chose to use LevelDB was to persist the list of nodes seen, but due to the bug, and considering that I could use other less complex schemes to persist the data, I didnxe2x80x99t invest more time on trying to fix the bug for this post (although is something I will definitely do when I find the time).To be honest, Ixe2x80x99ve had the time of my life playing with this project. Ixe2x80x99ve said it a few times in this newsletter but let me do it one more time, I wish I could make this my full-time job! I would love to know your feedback if you test the tool. According to your feedback it maybe make sense to grow the project and actively maintain it. For the meantime, after going a bit deeper into libp2p, I came up with a few more ideas to explore, and I have already started a new xe2x80x9cquick and dirty projectxe2x80x9d to learn something new. The next one combines WASM, libp2p and Rust. Stay tuned to see the results (depending on my availability in the next few weeks I may publish the results in a month or so).

So I decided to retrieve one more of my Medium articles for the newsletter. The design of consensus algorithms is a field of research within blockchain that fascinates me, and I am looking to extensively write about it in future publications. In the meantime, this article is short and to the point, the perfect introduction for the content yet to come. I hope you like it.Reaching  consensus in a trustless blockchain network is not an easy task, but donxe2x80x99t take me from granted and ask our friend Satoshi. He faced this problem while designing and implementing Bitcoin, how did he fix it? Proposing a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, i.e. forcing nodes in the network, miners, to dedicate their hardware resources to fix a hard-mathematical problem.The solver of this problem would be allowed to seal the next block in the chain, decide the order of transaction, and be consequently rewarded for its services helping to keep the network running.After a decade operating on a production system such as Bitcoin, proof-of-work has been shown a solid consensus algorithm, widely accepted by the crypto community and almost impossible to attack. However, proof-of-work still poses certain drawbacks such as:Waste of Energy. Miners are constantly trying to solve a hard-mathematical problem, even if  they donxe2x80x99t end up being the ones rewarded for solving the block. All  this computational power could have been used for more useful tasks such  as discovering a new protein to cure cancer (who knows?).Scalability. Proof-of-workxe2x80x99s operation makes it difficult to scale over the dozen transactions per second, something unacceptable for certain use cases.Centralization. The increased difficulty in certain PoW-based blockchain platforms has resulted in the appearance of big mining pools owning a great majority of the computational power of the network, and increasing the likelihood of 51% attacks.These  drawbacks are the ones that made blockchain developers and researchers  around the world to embark in the hard quest of designing brand new consensus algorithms.As a result of this quest Proof-of-Stake was discovered. Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a more energy-efficient consensus algorithm compared to PoW. Instead of randomized block solving based on computational power, this algorithm bases the randomization on the number of tokens a network member is staking.If a node wants to be eligible for solving the next block, it needs to stake a set of tokens in a wallet.The bigger the amount someone stakes, the bigger the odds he has to be selected as the next verifier of a block of transactions. As with PoW, block verifiers are rewarded for their service.Proof-of-stake increases decentralization, allows higher transaction throughputs and promotes decentralization. However, basic PoS algorithm still has some problems, e.g. the classic xe2x80x9cthe rich get richer and the poor stay poorxe2x80x9d.If  you could afford a big bag of coins of a certain blockchain, the chances are higher that you will get rewarded if you stake and your holdings will increase through said staking xe2x80x94 yet again increasing your chances for getting rewarded, and so on down the line.Fortunately, smart variations of PoS have been proposed to enhance its vanilla version:Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS): In  DPoS there is a fixed number of validators authorized to secure the  network. Token holders instead of directly staking their tokens use them to vote for the next authorized node to validate the transaction. The validators with the most votes get to become delegates, validating  transactions and collecting rewards for doing so. Platforms such as Lisk, Tron, Steem, Bitshares and EOS use variants of dPoS. I am not a big fan of this variant of PoS, as it reminds me greatly to Proof of Work mining pools.Liquid Proof-of-Stake (lPoS): In LPoS delegation is optional. Token holders can delegate validation rights to other token holders without custody, i.e. they donxe2x80x99t lose the  tokens from their wallets. In this PoS variant only the validator is  penalized if an attack is detected in the chain. LPoS also offer voting rights, except that as a token holder you get to vote directly in the protocol amendments, and not only in who secures the network like in  DPoS. Platforms such as Tezos use lPoS.Bonded Proof-of-Stake (bPoS): BPoS is very similar to LPoS, delegation is optional, non-custodial, and  token holders benefit from voting rights in protocol amendments. Although, there is a reason why it is called BPoS: in case of safety or  liveness fault, a portion of the validators and delegatorsxe2x80x99 stake will be slashed. In LPoS, only the validator is at risk of slashing, while the delegatorxe2x80x99s only risk is to miss on some rewards/interests in case its validator is dishonest or not efficient. BPoS has the advantage of  providing a clear solution to the issue of staking ratios (similar to  capital requirements) where some validators on LPoS protocols have to maintain if they do not want to become over-delegated and disappoint  some of their delegators. While it solves this issue, it also means that  delegators need to conduct extra due diligence before delegating and remain active in verifying the performance of their validator. BPos may be found in projects such as Cosmos.Hybrid Proof-of-Stake (HPoS): Hybrid  PoS/PoW is often referred to as a mix between Proof-of-Work and  Proof-of-Stake. In HPoS miners produce new blocks via PoW, and PoS validators then vote on the validity of these. HPoS provides a superior  deterrent to majority attacks by augmenting hashing power with  stakeholder voting.These are just some of the main representatives of PoS variants already implemented, nonetheless in the quest of finding the perfect PoW replacement, way more brand new consensus algorithms and PoS variants will appear in time, and if you donxe2x80x99t believe me just try to make a quick search about Wavexe2x80x99s Leased PoS, Tomochain PoS Voting, Dashxe2x80x99s Masternode staking or NEOxe2x80x99s Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. We will have to stay tune to know the result of this quest. A set of consensus algorithms I personally want to go deeper into are Cardanoxe2x80x99s Ouroboros, and Algorandxe2x80x99s PoS. Ouroboros is backed by years of academic research, and both are said to be elegant ways out to the blockchain trilemma (security v.s. decentralization v.s. performance).

For me, it is not Google, nor Facebook, is all of them. The killer app of the Internet is the Web itself. We use the Web to do more and more of our daily tasks. We even file our taxes and buy our groceries online (more so considering the times we are living). Along with DNS, the core protocol of the Web is HTTP, and in this post I will try to drive you through its history and its most recent major updates.HTTP is a network protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents, from distant machine. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually a Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched (text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more). Sounds familiar, right? This is how your favorite websites are rendered in your machine.Source: https://developer.mozilla.orgHTTP is an extensible protocol which has evolved over time. It is an application layer protocol that is sent over  TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, though any reliable transport protocol could theoretically be used (this concept will come in handy when we talk about QUIC). Due to its extensibility, it is used to to fetch any kind of resource (JSON files, media, data blobs, etc.).When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or an intermediate proxy, it performs the following steps:Open a TCP connection: The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an answer. The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP  connections to the servers.Send an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these simple messages are encapsulated in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle remains the same (more about this in the next section).Close or reuse the connection for further requests.If HTTP pipelining is activated, several requests can be sent without waiting for the first response to be fully received. HTTP pipelining has proven difficult to implement in existing networks, where old pieces of software coexist with modern versions. HTTP pipelining has been superseded in HTTP/2 with more robust multiplexing requests within a frame.The primary goals for HTTP/2 are to reduce latency by enabling full request and response multiplexing, minimize protocol overhead via efficient compression of HTTP header fields, and add support for request prioritization and server push. HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported between the client and server.At the core of all performance enhancements of HTTP/2 is the new binary framing layer, which dictates how the HTTP messages are encapsulated and transferred between the client and server. The \"layer\" refers to a design choice to introduce a new optimized encoding mechanism between the socket interface and the higher HTTP API exposed to our applications. The HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers, are unaffected, but the way they are encoded while in transit is different. In this new version of HTTP:All communication is performed over a single TCP connection that can carry any number of bidirectional streams.Each stream has a unique identifier and optional priority information that is used to carry bidirectional messages.Each message is a logical HTTP message, such as a request, or response, which consists of one or more frames.The frame is the smallest unit of communication that carries a specific type of dataxe2x80x94e.g., HTTP headers, message payload, and so on. Frames from different streams may be interleaved and then reassembled via the embedded stream identifier in the header of each frame.With HTTP/1.x, if the client wants to make multiple parallel requests to improve performance, then multiple TCP connections must be used. HTTP/2 removes these limitations, and enables full request and response multiplexing, by allowing the client and server to break down an HTTP message into independent frames, interleave them, and then reassemble them on the other end. Starting new TCP connections is an expensive operation, so the lesser number of connections required to exchange our data, the less overhead wexe2x80x99ll be face in the communication.Another powerful new feature of HTTP/2 is the ability of the server to send multiple responses for a single client request. That is, in addition to the response to the original request, the server can push additional resources to the client, without the client having to request each one explicitly. This is what we do when we inline CSS or Javascript in our HTML file, we are pushing these resources along with our document through to the client (instead of having to request them explicitly from the client like in HTTP/1.x).One final advantage of HTTP/2 over HTTP/1.x is the ability to compress HTTP headers. The use of frames allows the compression of headers, and this improvement  has a significant impact in performance. To understand the impact, this quote from Patrick McManus from Mozilla illustrates perfectly the effect of headers for an average page load:If you assume that a page has about 80 assets (which is conservative in  todayxe2x80x99s Web), and each request has 1400 bytes of headers (again, not  uncommon, thanks to Cookies, Referer, etc.), it takes at least 7-8 round  trips to get the headers out xe2x80x9con the wire.xe2x80x9d Thatxe2x80x99s not counting  response time - thatxe2x80x99s just to get them out of the client.But despite all the improvements made in HTTP/2, the are things still to be fixed to make it the ultimate transport protocol. The first thing to bear in mind about QUIC is that it is not limited to just transporting HTTP. QUIC was designed looking to make the web and data in general delivered faster to end users. In June 2015, an Internet Draft of a specification for QUIC was submitted to the IETF for standardization. A QUIC working group was established in 2016. In October 2018, the IETF's HTTP and QUIC Working Groups jointly decided to call the HTTP mapping over QUIC \"HTTP/3\" in advance of making it a worldwide standard. So QUIC is not only HTTP/3, but much more.With HTTP/2, typical browsers do tens or hundreds of parallel transfers over a single TCP connection. If a single packet is dropped, or lost in the network somewhere between two endpoints that speak HTTP/2, it means the entire TCP connection is brought to a halt while the lost packet is re-transmitted and finds its way to the destination. All of the advantage gained by multiplexing streams, thrown to the trash. Fixing this issue is not easy, if at all possible, with TCP, and this is one of the reasons why it was decided to build QUIC over UDP.The fact that QUIC is built over UDP means that there is no message ordering and reliability by design like in TCP, but not to worry. QUIC uses steams to provide a lightweight, ordered byte-stream abstraction. QUIC streams can be unidirectional streams, carrying data in one direction from the initiator of the stream to its peer; and bidirectional streams which allow for data to be sent in both directions. Streams are identified using a Stream ID (a handy piece of information used to order data in its corresponding stream within reception).QUIC is always secure. There is no clear-text version of the protocol so negotiating a QUIC connection means also doing cryptography and security with TLS 1.3. There are only a few initial handshake packets that are sent in the clear before the encryption protocols have been negotiated. The cool thing about this security by-design is that by encrypting as much of the communication as possible, we prevent middle-boxes routing our traffic from seeing much of the protocol passing through (for privacy freaks like me, this is groundbreaking).QUIC offers both 0-RTT and 1-RTT handshakes that reduce the time it takes to negotiate and setup a new connection. Compared with the 3-way handshake of TCP, the improvement is noticeable. The 1-RTT connection is used to startup a new connection, while the 0-RTT handshake only works if there has been a previous connection established to a host and a secret from that connection has been cached (the best way of understanding this feature is the animation below).All of the aforementioned features belong to QUIC, and it is upon them that HTTP/3 is built. HTTP/3 does HTTP-style transports, including HTTP header compression over QUIC stream, offering multilpexing by-design (unlike HTTP/2 where multiplexing had to be implemented from scratch in the protocol). HTTP/3 works sending data using frames (like in HTTP/2) over a QUIC stream. Thus, in an HTTP/3 request, the client sends its HTTP request on a client-initiated bidirectional QUIC stream. A request consists of a single HEADERS frame (which might be optionally compressed) followed by one or two other frames: a series of DATA frames and possibly a final HEADERS frame for trailers. After sending a request, a client closes the stream for sending. The server sends back its HTTP response on the bidirectional stream. A HEADERS frame, a series of DATA frames and possibly a trailing HEADERS frame. Easy peasy!I was trying to find some kind of survey analyzing the distribution of versions of HTTP connections out in the wild. I would say that the predominant version of HTTP used by web applications currently is HTTP/2, with very little adoption of HTTP/3 and QUIC so far, but this are just guesses. I couldnxe2x80x99t find any reliable source with information about this. I am personally pretty excited to see QUIC working in the wild, and if I find the time, for a future publication I want to try to set up my own web application working over QUIC to see the benefits of this pretty cool piece of engineering.

One of the principles behind funding innovation is what the insiders call power law. The idea is that the winners make up for all the losing bets. The winners create a halo effect around the firm and the people that work there. Success stories beget soon-to-be-success stories. People being wrong the vast majority of the time is such a predictable reality and a forgone conclusion that it is often not even acknowledged in discussions about venture capital. In any other business, your career would be at risk for being so wrong all the time! How does having the storied legacy of Kleiner Perkins amplify everything you do and say impact your decision making? I'm always impressed by people who manage to be extremely skeptical of their own beliefs because when you are representing a storied firm, it is easy to seduce yourself into thinking you can predict and sell better than the next intelligent person.Bucky : Our firm is fortunate to have been involved with each of the three companies you mention. Investing from a platform like KP is an undeniable source of advantage for us as investors for the reasons you described. We do not take this for granted, and carry a fierce belief in the need to continuously expand our viewpoints and reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to the next generation of entrepreneurs. This requires approaching the venture business with a growth mindset, and seeking out new opportunities to learn whenever they present themselves. The investors who manage to adhere to this approach, even after they have achieved initial success, seem to be those who go on to have long and meaningful careers in this industry. I aspire to be one of these investors.Monica : Itxe2x80x99s a lot to live up to, and I wonxe2x80x99t even pretend I start to do so quite yet xf0x9fx98x89. As you mentioned, this job is so humbling because every day you see something work that you hadnxe2x80x99t expected, and you have to reevaluate your priors while still trying to keep a beginnerxe2x80x99s mindset. Wexe2x80x99re lucky to have that legacy and expertise to learn from, but I also think VC is about constantly reinventing yourself and your viewpoints so you can never rest on your laurels too much!Sar : My impression is that Bucky focuses on how companies deploy software and make sense of data collected from software usage efficiently, securely and reliably. Monica, on the other hand, is focused on financial health, workplace experience and changing nature of work in broad strokes. Would that be a fair assessment?Bucky: I am fascinated by the ongoing opportunity to use software and data to unlock new efficiencies in the workplace. Whether itxe2x80x99s a matter of improving an application developerxe2x80x99s productivity, enabling an analyst to get the answer they need from their data faster, or automating a tedious compliance process that a security engineer was previously forced to carry out manually, I am looking to partner with founders who share my passion for solving these foundational problems that exist across nearly every industry and size of business. My time at Cisco as a member of their corporate development team illuminated just how outsized an impact these types of products had on the companies and services we rely on as consumers to live our lives. The population of end-users they address pales in comparison to that of any B2C product, but their impact on society is underestimated by most. For example, what good is a bank if they canxe2x80x99t guarantee your account is secure? Banks spend billions each year on products that help them with this. Monica: Ixe2x80x99ve spent a lot of time thinking through consumer trends xe2x80x94 from financial services to community creation to workplace engagement. The nature of work is the most recent addition, which seemed particularly pressing as folks went remote so suddenly xe2x80x94 feels like Zoom, Slack, Airtable, Figma etc have solved much of the productivity piece, but therexe2x80x99s still a lot of white space in the softer aspects. What keeps you engaged at your job, and motivated? How do you build relationships with folks outside your team, your xe2x80x9cweak tiesxe2x80x9d that expose you to more cross-functional opportunities? How can we use this moment to make the workforce more inclusive, and ensure more equal access to mentoring and coaching?Sar : So, Monica focuses on relatable ideas while Bucky focuses on the under-the-hood ideas. Both areas are incredibly impactful! The core difference between those two sets of ideas is the level of legibility to a large number of regular human beings. It is far easier to relate with a product that helps immigrants get credit cards in the US than a product that helps a few engineers write code together. Whatxe2x80x99s fascinating to me is how and where both of your focus areas converge in terms of impact. Effective software can be sneaky in how it shapes behaviors of a group of people over time. Well designed software is opinionated. It takes a stance on how something should or shouldn't work. Recurring small interactions with good software shapes how we think, live, work. How do guys think about where your focus areas intersect? The second order effects of ideas are often more powerful than the direct impact.Monica : Itxe2x80x99s a great point. Wexe2x80x99re definitely in a place of abundance in fintech in particular xe2x80x94 it has never been easier to build a fintech product or company, and new infrastructure companies are getting funded every week to further lower that barrier. This is the natural cycle of technology, but it's critical to understand where we are in it, and what trends will enable further barriers to break down. So much of Buckyxe2x80x99s world underpins what will allow the next innovator to come up even faster than the last, and thus relates to how I think about defensibility and moats. Banking as a Service is such a great example of this exact question xe2x80x94 these players are acting as intermediaries, connecting fast moving startups or companies with other focus areas to the banking infrastructure that enables new products. That is critical since each side of that marketplace speaks different languages: different tech stacks, different comfort with payment rails, different needs in compliance. How much will those tech stacks change and converge over time? Will we see more data standardization and connectivity, such that they could start to speak directly? These are really interdisciplinary questions wexe2x80x99re trying to answer. Bucky : Monica articulated it perfectly. Itxe2x80x99s been fascinating to watch the reinvention of financial infrastructure to a xe2x80x9cdeveloper-friendlyxe2x80x9d set of building blocks unfold over the past few years. A company like Plaid appears to have more overlap with companies like Twilio and Stripe than it does with a neobank. I find this super interesting, and not limited to Plaid in this new landscape. Does this make it an API infrastructure company, or a fintech company? While the answer is certainly xe2x80x9cboth,xe2x80x9d the example was meant to speak to the way Monica and Ixe2x80x99s worldxe2x80x99s have been colliding as of late. Much of the innovation I see here is ultimately software and APIs that enable core financial services to be delivered through digital products. However, building such products requires deep expertise in non-engineering disciplines like credit underwriting, compliance, and risk management. Itxe2x80x99s rare to find developers with experience in these areas, so you end up seeing different founding team DNA here than you do in general purpose computing infrastructure.Sar : I loved how Monicaxe2x80x99s thinking backed into Buckyxe2x80x99s domain. This idea of middleware as translators in tech stacks is universally applicable across problems. I would imagine this is where the edge from investing as a group really comes in. The parallels you drew between fintech infrastructure and computing infrastructure and the variance in associated skill sets is how I think about open source and social media. Those two worlds are a lot similar than it seems at first look. You are designing primitives, you are anticipating the needs of the next layer of developers (or content creators), you are growing a massive user base, you are thinking through communities, you are monetizing a fraction of the user base, etc One common thread in the long arc of innovation in financial services, workplace experience and computing infrastructure is everything is getting more connected over time. The default assumption in how it is all being designed is shifting from solo experience to a multiplayer experience. I think the pace of this change is the slowest in financial services as of today. I think the consequences of that are far more powerful than what gets conveyed in the collaboration memes. Ultimately, connecting everything means harnessing the power of collectives, for better or worse. What do you guys think about the long term implications? Feel free to use examples to make it concrete.Monica : Two thoughts here; 1) connectivity is the backbone of remote work, which is super exciting in that it enables new forms of flexibility for people, and it serves to unlock talent in places and chunks (modular work) that were not possible prior. The double edged sword seems to be that this further untethers workers from their employers, as we saw in past shifts like the gig economy. Tenure goes down. The new employee experience xe2x80x94 benefits, career progression, mentorship xe2x80x94 comes into question. Ultimately, I still think this shift is for the better, but I think there are really important relationships that are worth addressing sooner rather than later. 2) Financial services have absolutely lagged this shift, which as you point out, may be the most pressing opportunity today. This ties into the idea of automated finances, which feel essential as the infrastructure to launch new products keeps improving (BaaS, APIs, a healthy ecosystem) and reducing barriers to entry. I think the future here feels particularly bright - household finances which can be more inclusive of multi-generation households, pathways for young people to build credit faster. It will be a healthy reset in what financial wellness means, when it comes to your employerxe2x80x99s responsibility.  Bucky : Connectivity lays the foundation for communities to form. Not only does it provide the necessary communication backbone for like-minded people to organize and share ideas, but it also enables them to work together without the xe2x80x9ctaxxe2x80x9d that stems from the inability to communicate efficiently. The net of this is that we will continue to see the success of more companies and industries be driven by the strength of their user, peer, and customer communities. This is illustrated by Github. Before the rise of git, collaborating on code was an arduous process. Github democratized access to the benefits of git, which arguably paved the way to the renaissance period we have been in the midst of for years in the world of software development. Another interesting consequence of Githubxe2x80x99s success lies in the way they have helped open-source projects and their maintainers thrive. The tools they build have made it more economical and feasible to deliver open-source software to the world, which in turn has dramatically increased both the quality and quantity of open-source software available to developers. The more abstract conclusion I draw from this example is that seamless collaboration being interwoven into the products we use will lead to higher overall productivity, more equal access to opportunity, and a more interesting world in general :)Sar : What are some fairly mainstream ideas in your respective areas that were fringe just five years ago?Monica : Hmm...all of cryptoxf0x9fx98x89? As a baseline, the idea that institutional funds, Robinhood and governments alike would be frequent BTC buyers would have seemed crazy more than five years ago. DeFi would have basically been SciFi. Automated and embedded fintech would have seemed completely unnecessary, as most people were still focused on retail banking. The shift to digital payments was on the horizon, but felt far away xe2x80x94 it wasnxe2x80x99t until this April that Square saw cashless merchants jump from 8 to 31%. Finally, alternative forms of underwriting were just getting started xe2x80x94 now you have folks like Affirm and Nova Credit that are pioneering a whole new model there. And of course, remote first companies were considered fringe as recently as February!Bucky : Cloud data warehouses. At some point over the course of xe2x80x9814-xe2x80x9915, I lost count of how many large companies told me they did not see their data warehouse ever moving to the cloud. All one has to do is look at Snowflakexe2x80x99s market cap to know whether that proved true or not. Another idea that was certainly xe2x80x9cfringexe2x80x9d in xe2x80x9815 is serverless computing. AWS released its Lambda service at the end of the prior year. Lastly, VCs were still arguing over whether or not many valuable companies would be built around the notion of serving developers as end-users. The other pattern amongst the three examples I shared is that the rate at which each became mainstream would have been far more obvious had one used the framing of xe2x80x9cis this more convenient for the user.xe2x80x9d I believe xe2x80x9cconveniencexe2x80x9d is perennially undervalued by most when handicapping the success of a new idea or startup in computing infrastructure, and often lost amidst a sea of technical, security, or cost benefits. It tends to win out over these attributes, almost uniformly. Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention this is one of my favorite questions in that it reinforces just how much it really xe2x80x9cpaysxe2x80x9d to be an optimist. Sar : What ideas or ways of thinking are helpful to draw from the other personxe2x80x99s focus? What do you find exciting about each otherxe2x80x99s domains?Monica : I love learning about the ethos and practices around community building for developer-oriented companies xe2x80x94 youxe2x80x99ve seen the likes of Stripe & Netlify set the gold standard of a consistent community strategy, content and tone. Those are playbooks which I think consumer companies could benefit from. Community is such an amorphous concept, but I believe connecting new audiences around specific wedges will be core to the next wave of consumer cos xe2x80x94 wexe2x80x99ve seen the first wave of that with companies like Propel and Pillar. Ixe2x80x99m also seeing the business models converge, as open source and APIs became the keys to unlock the next wave of innovation. Bucky : As I mentioned, fintech founders tend to be multi-disciplinary given the nature of their business sits at the intersection of software and finance, two fields that are nearly orthogonal to one another. Ixe2x80x99ve found that multi-disciplinary founders tend to have a uniquely holistic understanding of their business, and operate very effectively as a result. What Ixe2x80x99ve learned here is to be intentional about seeking out founders that possess this kind of xe2x80x9cdynamic range.xe2x80x9dSar : What do you wish was mainstream today? What needs to happen to get there anytime soon?Monica : First, wexe2x80x99ve been stuck on the same payment rails (ACH, debit, credit) for too long, and that has benefitted a few outsized winners but has stymied innovation. We saw those downsides early in Covid with many stimulus application and delivery hiccups, as I wrote about in Fintech for All. Real time payments (RTP) have to become real soon xe2x80x94 for now wexe2x80x99re just leveraging an ultra-low rate environment to approximate RTP, but that wonxe2x80x99t (hopefully) last forever. Instead, we need an actual low cost, standardized, universal option xe2x80x94 and ideally it would be programmable. That is to say, one day you could get paid in micro-increments as you work, and pay others as you consume their work online (media, music, commerce, etc). Crypto is certainly one viable path here, but we still need to find a scalable solution and make the space more approachable from a product & design perspective. Ixe2x80x99m also hoping that the next wave of fintech addresses the complexity of the world we live in today. No one has quite cracked it within the fintech community, even though finances are a deeply defining part of our lives. We need products that allow for information sharing, community and de-stigmatization of everyday things like student debt. We also need products that make it easier to invest responsibly, including better gateways to fractional ownership. Thatxe2x80x99s recently revolutionized trading xf0x9fx8ex89 but Ixe2x80x99d love to see more options around alternative assets and homes. Here, the biggest issues are around education / approachability and liquidity xe2x80x94 the ability to build a real secondary market around these assets. That will require regulatory changes, distribution hacks like leveraging existing pools of money (ETFs, retirement, etc) and new data services to create a mark-to-market for these assets.Finally, as Ixe2x80x99ve mentioned, I believe remote work is firmly here to stay (in some hybrid sense, perhaps). Ixe2x80x99d like to see remote work live up to the promise around flexibility and access, and really make it as easy to build a company in Mumbai as it is in Montreal as it is in the Bay Area. Same for getting hired. Ixe2x80x99m hopeful that a mix of software and process will enable work to be modularized xe2x80x94 now is the time as we form new processes around performance expectations, async communication and handoffs. That would enable people to get trained on the job and caregivers to work part time. And everyone needs a place to bond still, so xe2x80x93 who will build Fortnite for work? Bucky : There are three xe2x80x9cbig ideasxe2x80x9d in computing and data infrastructure that are most exciting to me at the moment. First, I believe that as xe2x80x9ccompaniesxe2x80x9d increasingly become xe2x80x9csoftware companies,xe2x80x9d the rhythm of their operations will be closely tethered to their software delivery pipeline. What this means is that more and more of the business must be re-written as code that can be versioned, tested, automated, and collaborated on in a similar vein. This has already happened with how infrastructure is provisioned (Hashicorp Terraform), as well as how business analytics are produced (DBT). Now that almost every business process is being orchestrated by software, I believe this concept will become increasingly pervasive, and lead to the rise of many valuable new companies. For example, you can imagine workflows, like how a new customer lead is captured and processed, or how compliance is enforced following a similar pattern. Ixe2x80x99m excited about this because it requires large existing product categories to be re-architected to enable this new paradigm, presenting all kinds of interesting new opportunities for startups.The second big idea I am excited about is the shift toward capturing, processing and analyzing business data in real-time. Consumer products like Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook have conditioned us to expect access to the benefits of the data we create and share with them, immediately. This is far from the case in the workplace today. The internal dashboards we rely on to make decisions are typically refreshed on an hourly basis at best. The systems of record we use such as Salesforce or SAP still produce analytics on a batch basis. Why is this? Because building real-time data pipelines remains prohibitively difficult and expensive, and the volume of data we want to process this way continues to grow in size. While there is no shortage of exciting work underway to change this, I believe the rate at which we evolve toward real-time remains underestimated. The key to unlocking this will be re-thinking conventional approaches to data processing to incorporate the reality that modern business data is more dynamic than ever before. This requires the ability to understand how the answer to a specific question changes as new data is generated on a continuous basis, rather than being able to ask many different questions of the same, static data set. If I had to guess, I see this capability being delivered by startups rather than existing players, who are wed to technical approaches that did not take this xe2x80x9cneedxe2x80x9d into account.Finally, the third idea is this future in which developers can program xe2x80x9cthe cloudxe2x80x9d as if it is one single computer. The simplicity this unlocks is hard to overstate, particularly when you think about how much complexity a developer must wrangle with today when working with the various cloud platforms. First, we need to make it easier for developers to access computing infrastructure and applications securely, anywhere. Then, we will need to standardize the way these applications are deployed and ultimately run. This is unfolding quickly, and coincides with the rise of Kubernetes as the predominant way that applications are being managed in the cloud-native era. The end result will be an industry landscape that cedes less power to the three major cloud providers, leaving the players whose software overlays and abstracts away this complexity in the most strategic position. This future is far more appealing to me as an investor than one where the three cloud providers have full control over how developers work.Previous interviews : Jake Gibson & Sheel Mohnot, Cofounding Partners of Better Tomorrow VenturesJosh Schwarzapel, early web entrepreneur & fintech executiveCharlie Deutsch, GM of Financial Services at TrueAccordErica Dorfman, VP of Treasury & Payments at BrexNatasha Mascarenhas, Reporter at TechCrunchMary Ann Azevedo, Managing Editor of FinLedgerJackie Vullinghs, Principal at Sydney based AirTree VenturesKatie Perry, VP of Marketing at PublicJulia DeWahl, ex Chief of Staff at OpendoorJill Carlson, Principal at Slow VenturesBiz Carson, Reporter at ProtocolJack Altman, Cofounder & CEO of LatticeFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"A chat with Monica Desai Weiss & Bucky Moore, Investors at Kleiner Perkins - SarHaribhakti's Newsletter","url":"https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-monica-desai-weiss-and"}

You guys have gotten praise universally in fintech circles online for closing a sizable first fund in the middle of a pandemic. Both of you have publicly said multiple times how you couldn't have done without the help of lots of people in our tech world. I know enough about you guys to know you really mean it. Itxe2x80x99s not like you two are random people without extensive background and prior success in your domain. Can you tell us how your peers and friends have helped you in your journey in closing this fund?Jake & Sheel : Thanks man! Itxe2x80x99s been a wild ride, and amazing to think that all this work has just earned us the right to be on the field. Now we still have to play the game to win.In terms of help from our friends, we do mean that quite literally.For one, the hundreds of founders that we backed - we wouldnxe2x80x99t be where we are today if they hadnxe2x80x99t allowed us to jump on their coattails. Venture is very much an asset class where the asset chooses you, and we count ourselves incredibly fortunate to have been able to work with so many phenomenal founders. Many of them even stepped up as references for us, helping us sell LPs and also helping us sell other founders who donxe2x80x99t know us as well.Then therexe2x80x99s the xe2x80x9cfriends and familyxe2x80x9d (we mean friends, and family of our friendsxe2x80xa6 not our actual family), some of whom were backers in our last fund (500 Fintech), most of whom came in to the first close of BTV, allowing us to generate some initial fundraising momentum and make our first investments. We quite literally couldnxe2x80x99t have done any of this without them.And finally, we have many friends in the VC world, a lot of whom have recently raised funds themselves. Everyone was very generous with their Rolodexes, opening up doors for us, and nudging their own LPs to give us a serious look, which paid serious dividends.Sar : You guys have said xe2x80x9ceverything is fintechxe2x80x9d is your thesis and itxe2x80x99s become a hot meme these days. Can you walk us through what fintech actually means. How has that evolved into the xe2x80x9ceverything is fintechxe2x80x9d story?Jake & Sheel : Oh manxe2x80xa6.We feel like therexe2x80x99s a whole book in this one. Or like, we go to a coffee shop and smoke cloves and discuss what is and isnxe2x80x99t fintech until the wee hours of the morning.Our friend Seth at Greylock did a great job laying it out here: Finance is xe2x80x9cInfrastructure to exchange resources with unknown people and businesses.xe2x80x9d If you break it down there, every element is solvable with technology - finance is inherently a technology business. Therexe2x80x99s really not that much of a difference between moving money and resources around the world vs moving bits of information. The biggest differences are essentially self-imposed - regulation, security, and privacy. In the past, these were constraints that handicapped financial services from innovating as fast as the rest of the internet-based economy, but thatxe2x80x99s changing, and fast.Now, people who built companies in the last wave of fintech, and had to deal with all of these issues first hand, learnt all of the arcane intricacies and built around them, are starting new companies to help solve those problems for other companies. Effectively modularizing and API-ifying all of the nitty gritty pieces of the stack, like KYC/AML, SOC2 compliance, regulatory clearance for insurance / lending / banking / etc, data aggregation and integration, simplifying payments rails, you name itWe believe this will have a compounding effect similar to the early development of the web /mobile - enabling technology built on top of enabling technology, constantly lowering the barriers to building. This should allow teams to focus the effort on the xe2x80x9ctechxe2x80x9d rather than the xe2x80x9cfinxe2x80x9d.Fintech founders and investors have been talking for a decade now about financial inclusion and access, but we havenxe2x80x99t seen enough yet. Our hope is that by lowering the barriers to building, you give teams the capability to focus more on innovating around the product and revenue model, and less on the underlying plumbing, so you also lower the barriers to access. Sar : I know you guys strongly believe that there will be a lot of companies that donxe2x80x99t start out as financial services companies but can eventually launch financial products. Once a company has a large engaged customer base and is a system of record (and has transactions, trust and data associated with it), it can launch insurance and lending offerings. When you are working with founders under this thesis, the thesis doesnxe2x80x99t actually play out until much after you have invested. How do you advice teams on staying focused and not let the long term fintech story become a distraction in the medium term?Jake & Sheel : You know, that used to be the case. Like with the Ubers, Shopifys, and Flexports of the world, they needed to reach a certain scale before it made sense to invest in building a financial services platform from scratch, inside of their existing organizations.These days, you donxe2x80x99t need to build anything from scratch. The middleware, the compliance tech, the complementary data, nearly everything is now API-able in some way, so the upfront investment is much lower. And itxe2x80x99s going to keep coming down.This means that companies are starting to think about implementing financial features much earlier than they would have before. Wexe2x80x99re investing in companies at pre-seed and seed that already have a fintech strategy built into their business model.And this is actually where we think it gets powerful. This isnxe2x80x99t xe2x80x9clet me build this tech platform with its own economics and its own distribution, and then add fintech later as a nice cherry on top.xe2x80x9d Itxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9chow would my entire business model, user experience, distribution, etc be different if I include financial services as a core component of the product?xe2x80x9d You can give software away for free and make it up on interchange, you can give loans away at cost and make it up with subscription fees, having financial products embedded directly in the product workflow could reduce churn, having payments embedded directly into the product could help with distribution, etc...We believe this is really where innovation starts to happen in fintech, especially for audiences and demographics that have traditionally been overlooked. Ideas that previously might have looked niche, or unprofitable, take on a very different character now.Sar : How should forward-thinking non-fintech startup or financial services executives not spending all their time on this think about whatxe2x80x99s going on? Whatxe2x80x99s the pitch to get them excited and go xe2x80x9cokay, this is interesting and we need to explore this aggressively!xe2x80x9dJake & Sheel : If you donxe2x80x99t, someone else will, and theyxe2x80x99ll have better margins and a stronger relationship with their customers that will lead to a stickier customer base than you do. If youxe2x80x99re the place that the merchant conducts the bulk of their business, it makes sense that youxe2x80x99d want to. Sar : In the everything-is-fintech story, there are multiple types of companies in the ecosystem. Therexe2x80x99s companies that are enabling software companies to launch financial services. Therexe2x80x99s software companies that are launching financial services as secondary products. Therexe2x80x99s companies that are productizing table stakes functions that every company with financial products would have to do. Therexe2x80x99s financial services companies that have realized externalizing what they do internally to others is a promising opportunity. Which of these categories do you guys feel most proficient in, which categories would you like to explore more, which have you invested the most in so far, which seem hardest to build category winners in?Jake & Sheel : We like to say wexe2x80x99re generalists within fintech. While there are certainly areas we understand better than others, we invest in it all. At the end of the day, wexe2x80x99re not particularly thesis-driven and while we have opinions on whatxe2x80x99s going to work and whatxe2x80x99s not, we try not to hold to them too tightly. We look to the founders for that, and just try to back exceptional people with novel solutions to large problems, and a vision for how the world should be.From your list, wexe2x80x99ve backed founders in every one of those categories, and will continue to do so.In the current BTV portfolio we have -Enabling: Unit.coLaunching as secondary: CloudTrucks, Punch List and potentially Capbase, FigureHRTable stakes: Pave.devSar : I like to joke that we trained an entire generation of startup people over the past decade to outsource payments and focus on the core product and business and now we are going xe2x80x9cjust kidding!xe2x80x9d. It was basically a cost center and a means to an end and we were happy to use an API to solve for it. Now, therexe2x80x99s been a massive shift where therexe2x80x99s this narrative of turning payments into a revenue driver. What do you believe has triggered this?Jake & Sheel : We tend to think many companies/founders tend to focus too much on solving their own problems vs solving the problems of their users/customers. Nobodyxe2x80x99s willing to pay for our product? Letxe2x80x99s just add payments and make more money! So we think it ultimately comes down to whatxe2x80x99s the best experience for the end user, and how do you get them engaged, how do you keep them engaged, and how do you make sure youxe2x80x99re capturing enough of the value that youxe2x80x99re creating. In many cases, adding in your own payments functionality can meaningfully improve the product and the user experience, while at the same time helping you monetize. But we imagine in many cases, those resources are better spent trying to figure out what value your product actually adds to the world.Sar : Are there any common themes you have been seeing in pitches this year? Jake & Sheel : There are so many! Therexe2x80x99s some trend-following going on related to Covid and its impact on our economy. Lots of tools like payroll and benefits for remote teams, benefits for gig workers, financial products for a new generation of creators, enablers for new types of commerce out there.It seems like for every new fintech company that launches, there are 4-5 others doing nearly the exact same thing. It makes it a tougher market than it was before when those companies are all competing for the same customer set.Here are some specific ones wexe2x80x99ve seen a lot of lately:xe2x80x9cPlaid for Xxe2x80x9d We just went through a wave of Plaid for payroll, Plaid for student loans, Plaid for Insurance. Between those 3 wexe2x80x99ve seen ~20 companies! One interesting thing here is that Plaid launched their own payroll product, and they already have a liabilities product, so wexe2x80x99ll see how that all plays out.Documentation classification/parsing (converting PDFxe2x80x99s to APIxe2x80x99s)Parsing and analyzing data to underwrite loans and insurance is a manual process, so now wexe2x80x99ve seen >5 companies building this.Banks for Creators As the creator economy has blossomed, so have fintechs selling to this space. Wexe2x80x99ve seen >5 of these.Faster checkout optionsThis isnxe2x80x99t a new space but some of the hype from Fast and Shopifyxe2x80x99s success has caused others to go after this space, broadly. Sar : You guys have been active early stage fintech investors for a while. Are there any beliefs that you held 3-4 years ago that now seem to have been proven wrong? Conversely, what did you get very right in how the fintech world has played out?Jake & Sheel : We are sure wexe2x80x99re wrong about something every single day, and itxe2x80x99s hard to compare past vs present at the moment, when everything has changed so quickly. And as we mentioned earlier, we donxe2x80x99t tend to hold those beliefs too firmly.[Sheel] It might be interesting to talk through some specific misses. Ixe2x80x99ve had a bunch of misses from my earliest days in investing as an angel (2012-2014). I was actually more curmudgeonly then, unable to imagine how big ideas could get. I actually credit moving to SF to opening me up to a lot of possibilities. I got to see that xe2x80x9ccrazy ideasxe2x80x9d , even ones that had been tried before could get funded and work here, sometimes first-hand.3 big misses, 2 of which pitched me at my house as an angel!Robinhood - xe2x80x9cThere have been several free trading apps before (Zecco, Freetrade), I donxe2x80x99t see what will make it work this timexe2x80x9dWhat I missed: mobile, timing, execution. Those previous entrants were competing with TD and Interactive Brokers, Robinhood was bringing a whole new class of investors online. The timing was right and the team did a phenomenal job of building the right product for that audience.Chime - At 500, we had invested in Simple and while they were able to build a huge waitlist and get people onto the app, not enough people were willing to switch their direct deposit account over, and the only way to make a lot of money is to be the primary account.What I missed: mobile, timing, execution. Chime has done a great job of building products that make consumers want to switch their direct deposit overxe2x80xa6 and times were different with a generation of people who wanted more digitally. Simple seemed to attract people like me- digitally native but actually being served just fine by the Chasexe2x80x99s of the world. Chime succeeded in bringing a digital first approach to those who werenxe2x80x99t well-served by existing banks already.Patreon: xe2x80x9cThis is super easy to build, itxe2x80x99s just a super basic payments functionality; I could build this myself in minutes on Stripe, who would pay for it?xe2x80x9dWhat I missed: Just because I could build it (the first version of Patreon) myself doesnxe2x80x99t mean others would. This was really stupid in hindsight.The one thing we have been very right on is that, despite the number of unicorns in the space, fintech still needed time to mature. There hadnxe2x80x99t been a lot of exit activity, relative to the amount of investment activity, so many investors shied away. But we largely chalked that up to these companies being flies on an elephantxe2x80x99s ass relative to the size of the overall financial services market (which is gigantic at last check). We assumed that would change in time, and that a wave of consolidation and exit activity would materialize as the sector grew up, and as the incumbents woke up to the threat. I donxe2x80x99t think we were expecting it to hit as hard and fast as it has lately, but we had a feeling that it was inevitable. Now wexe2x80x99re seeing M&A among incumbent companies, incumbents buying startups, IPOs, SPACs like crazy, and even the larger fintech companies gobbling up some newer entrants. Itxe2x80x99s a real investment ecosystem now, which is likely why so many new investors are starting to rush in and feel like they need to put some stakes in the groundSar : Can we please throw some cold water on what you believe are overhyped trends or conventional wisdom? It is hard to think of a single prominent firm in the US that isnxe2x80x99t hunting for fintech deals. I feel like you can yell fintech infrastructure and get a valuation bump these days. What categories are you instinctively staying away from?Jake & Sheel : We donxe2x80x99t actively stay away from any categories. Wexe2x80x99ve been pounding the table against PFMs for years, but one of our biggest success stories so far is Albert. Similarly, wexe2x80x99ve been bearish on new entrants to the neobanking space, but we just led a seed round for an SMB neobank (unannounced) because we loved their approach and GTM.Donxe2x80x99t tell our LPs this, but some might say that fintech as a whole is probably overhyped right now. As we alluded to above, suddenly everyone on the planet has become a fintech influencer on Medium or Substack, and every VC firm is searching for deals in fintech. We see investor profiles all the time that list fintech their core investment thesis, while theyxe2x80x99ve never actually invested in any fintech companies! Some are really quite egregious. Sar : You have incubated startups before and you plan on incubating more with the new firm. Can you tell us what were some lessons from your past experiences that have informed your operating philosophy now? Why do incubation at all?Jake & Sheel : We mostly do it because we canxe2x80x99t help ourselves. We are builders first and foremost, so we like to be operationally involved in our portfolio companies. We both thought a lot about why we wanted to be in this business before committing to each other and our LPxe2x80x99s that we were going to be doing this for the next decade+xe2x80xa6 and a big part of why we do this is we just love helping early stage companies get off the ground. So a big part of the justification for us being VCxe2x80x99s was that we could actually get our hands dirty too!Wexe2x80x99re not afraid to go early - if youxe2x80x99re looking to leave a fintech company and not sure what you want to do next, we want to meet you. If you have some ideas for a fintech company but need a sounding board, we want to meet you.Wexe2x80x99ve helped so many founders shorten their learning curves, and accelerate through those first few years of rapid experimentation, and we want to keep doing it.One way we do this is by building out a network of EIRs, just like we had in 500 Fintech, who can help our portfolio companies and potentially jam with us on future ideas. Our past ~7 EIRs all went on to either join the exec teams of some of our portfolio companies, or founded companies that we helped incubate and backed (or in Jakexe2x80x99s case, became Sheelxe2x80x99s partner!) So wexe2x80x99re always looking for those operators that are between gigs and unsure of whatxe2x80x99s next to come join us.[ Sar here xe2x80x94 If you are building something in fintech and are looking to pitch Sheel and Jake, feel free to email me.

During your time at Cooliris 2005-2010, you built out the first engineering team, led the main web plugin product, and and played a key role in the distribution partnership with Mozilla. Even though Cooliris was acquired by Yahoo in 2014, it feels like generations ago when you consider how different the world is now just 6 years later. What are your most cherished memories and hard-learned lessons from your time building the product in that era? Startups like Cooliris are a good reminder of how there are always lots of teams going after the same idea at any given time and how history gets written by one or two teams that make it. Josh : Throwback time! What was crazy about that era is that tech wasn't nearly as hot as it is now. Most of my classmates wanted to go to Goldman Sachs rather than work in tech.For context, we started Cooliris to build a better browser. Internet Explorer had ~90% market share, and we all knew it sucked. We started with a browser extension for media viewing that took off like a rocket, with over 30M downloads in just a couple of years. But we were unsuccessful in making the jump to a full fledged browser.What we did amazingly well at Cooliris was hire. Cooliris alumni went on to found or become very senior executives at Instagram, Slack, Twitter, eightfold.ai, Filecoin, Facebook, Oracle, and a bunch more. My biggest takeaways are:It's way easier to hire people when you have an ambitious vision.Run your hiring process like a sales funnel.Even the best people won't make you successful if your strategy is f*cked.For #1: Building a browser was a hard technical problem, and a product that everyone on the internet needed. The ambition and swagger we had as a team was a big draw. That's why places like Tesla or Amazon can hire such an amazing team. There is serious ambition behind those projects.For #2: We were SO aggressive at finding and recruiting the best people. We'd meet candidates over at Kleiner Perkins and walk them past John Doerr and Al Gore's desk. We'd pitch multiple times before we ever interviewed. We moved really fast once we were at the offer stage. We'd get to know the candidate and their spouse, and made sure they felt like (a) the opportunity was huge and (b) the team really wanted them. It's amazing to me how many big companies don't do this well. They rely on inbound, and there's very little selling that's done up front or at the end of the process. Managers outsource all coordination to recruiters, and the process drags on forever. If you look at hiring like a sales process, you'll completely change how you approach it.For #3: Despite having an absurdly talented team, and over 30M downloads of our software, we couldn't find a viable path to a product and business that was successful in the long term. You see this pattern ALL of the time. Quibi, Color, Magic Leap, you name itxe2x80xa6.they all had amazingly talented teams and all of the funding in the world, and it doesn't matter. What's worse, it's always harder to pivot and maneuver once you have a large team and tons of funding. The best businesses I've seen keep their teams REALLY constrained until product/market fit is obvious. Instagram only had 13 employees when they were acquired - that to me is the ideal.Sar : Folks at Yahoo at the time must really like you! You left Cooliris in 2010, co-founded OnTheAir in 2011 and got acquired by Yahoo once again just a year after the launch! Herexe2x80x99s what Josh Constine said in his coverage at the time in 2012 : xe2x80x9cThe app lets people set up adhoc webinars that can be watched over live stream by large audiences. The real differentiator was that OnTheAir could serve as a sort of video call-in radio show for the Internet age. A host could take requests from viewers to come xe2x80x9constage,xe2x80x9d then broadcast a split screen chat with them.However, with Airtime unable to gain traction and big players like Google investing heavily in the space, being successful while staying independent may have been tough for the team. An early acquisition bid before having to raise more money may have been the smartest move.xe2x80x9dOnce again, you were working on a product well ahead of its time. What can you tell us about how you were thinking about what you were trying to do at the time? What was and wasnxe2x80x99t working? I was in High School back then and had no idea what TechCrunch was! You were building products during a very formative time in Silicon Valley history. Most of the social and mobile juggernauts of today were getting off the ground. Would love for you to walk us through what was happening in the SV zeitgeist at the time! In 2012, Facebook was in the middle of transition to mobile, Snap was less than two years old, and Instagram was bought by Facebook. Tumblr got bought by Yahoo just a year later.Josh : When we were in undergrad, we were really lucky to get access to famous entrepreneurs we admired in college. We went out to dinner with Reid Hoffman, and had Vinod Khosla come in to do a case study with our class of 12. Getting to know these folks in intimate settings inspired a TON of us to enter tech and to try and start companies. Our mission at On The Air was to try and recreate this magic, and make the most interesting people in the world more accessible. If you imagine a spectrum of intimacy with Twitter on one hand, and a private dinner on the other, we wanted to push as close to the \"private dinner\" end of the spectrum as we could. Our product allowed celebrities and influencers to \"go live\" and talk with fans, who could go live on video and ask questions or hang out. Hangouts launched Hangouts On Air shortly after to do the same thing, as did Jeff Fluhr - the founder of StubHub - who launched Spreecast.  It turns out all of us had the wrong idea :). Specifically:We were all overly focused on synchronous, 2-way live video. It turns out that most regular consumers are shy, donxe2x80x99t want to be seen on video, and are kinda boring to listen to! Asynchronous publishing was the killer behavior, with YouTube and Instagram taking most of the fan/follower media habit. Masterclass also captured an interesting niche here, as did Periscope. The point on Periscope leads to...We were all desktop products. In 2011 when we started, it was still too early for mobile live video because of broadband speeds. It turns out that you really needed the notification channel to make a live video product work well - xe2x80x9cXYZ is live now!xe2x80x9d is a great push notification. Having a camera on your phone reduced the friction to publish as well. That allowed Periscope to find success a few years later.The big lesson for me here was a repeat of a famous Jeff Bezos saying: Be rigid on the vision, but flexible on the details. Our vision was largely right. But we got the details wrong and it killed the product. The other lesson is the same as Cooliris: super smart, ambitious people often have the wrong hypothesis. It wasnxe2x80x99t just usxe2x80xa6 the Hangouts team and the Spreecast team whiffed too. Fortunately our company ended well with the team and investors doing well in our sale to Yahoo.Sar : I think most people would still say we havenxe2x80x99t cracked synchronous, 2-way live video in the US. 1:many video streaming has thrived. And there are a lots of incarnations of internet radio products out there today.You spent nearly 4 years at Yahoo on mobile growth and emerging products as a senior product leader post acquisition from 2012 to 2016. Yahoo has had an amazing track record in buying hot startups but has struggled to integrate and grow most of them. What can you tell us about the prevailing philosophy on product development and acquisitions at the time? Both Google and Facebook who also were on an acquisitions spree during this era.  Josh : My time at Yahoo was super fun. We were the second acquisition of the Marissa Mayer era, and we helped build the mobile team and business from zero. Our team scaled from 4 to 40, and we helped Yahoo Mobile grow from $30M in revenue to $1B in revenue in 3 years. More importantly, an insanely talented group of entrepreneurs all came into the company at around the same time. It really was a lot of fun, and Ixe2x80x99m super proud of the work we did with the Mobile team.I do think there was a fatal flaw in Yahoo's broader strategy though. In particular, there was no way we were going to beat Google at Search or Email. And there was no way we were going to compete with Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, and YouTube for entertainment. All of these are insanely difficult, expensive habits to win, and we were starting way from behind. We ultimately spent aggressively to try and catch up, but only made small inroads on market share while our profitability cratered. This led to a lot of activist shareholder activity, and the executive team was ultimately forced to sell the company.In retrospect, the right (albeit painful) move would have been to cede search and mail to Google, and to lay off 80% of the company. We could have doubled revenue over night by outsourcing search and mail, and cut costs by 80%. We would have been throwing off billions of dollars in free cash flow every year, and the team would have bought 5-10 years to make a few big acquisitions or take a number of bets on categories that weren't so competitive. Hindsight is 20-20, but that would have been a savvier strategy in my opinion.Sar : Youxe2x80x99ve been working in fintech for almost 5 years now, across multiple products and customer types. What are some of the patterns you see?  Josh : First off, I think wexe2x80x99re seeing a massive, 20 year platform shift in financial services from paper and branches to software. And wexe2x80x99re only in the early innings, with incumbent banks still owning most of the customers and revenue. I suspect wexe2x80x99ll see several fintech companies value in the hundreds of billions of dollars in the decade to come.Whatxe2x80x99s interesting is that this transition looks like a classic low end disruption in the Christensen sense of the definition. Almost ALL of the mega-winners in fintech are focusing on down-market customer segments that big banks have traditionally overcharged. Chime, Robinhood, Dave, Earnin, Acorns, Digit, Affirm, AfterPay, Shopify, Gusto, Kabbagexe2x80xa6all of them started by aiming down-market of their legacy counterparts.Itxe2x80x99s worth noting that this isnxe2x80x99t because big banks are heartless, greedy sociopaths who only care about rich people. They simply have a higher cost structure per account - due to physical branches and labor intensive processes - that makes serving low income customers less profitable. This renders them unable to profitably target low-income customers with good products. Itxe2x80x99s also worth noting that the converse is truexe2x80xa6 almost no fintech startups have been successful in serving up-market customers, and incumbent banks have largely defended this turf to date. In terms of some finer points around whatxe2x80x99s working, Ixe2x80x99ve seen a few patterns emergingxe2x80xa6Pattern 1: the frequency / urgency paradigm is alive and well for fintech Kamo Asatryan, one of the smartest consumer product people I know, shared a framework with me for consumer products that I continue to come back to. The framework suggests the best consumer products address use cases that are both frequent and urgent. When it comes to lower income consumers, short term liquidity is the most urgent problem, and card spend is the most frequent use case. Lo and behold, the most valuable private fintech company (Chime) addresses both. They help with short term liquidity through SpotMe and early pay, and their customers spend on their card every day. This pattern is playing out all over fintech, with higher frequency use cases winning out. AfterPay is bigger than Affirm, Robinhood is bigger than Wealthfront/Betterment, and I suspect Dave will blow past Sofi in the next few years. Pattern 2: creative framing around price and valueMany breakout fintech products frame price and value in creative ways.Take the small dollar lenders like Earnin, Brigit, and Dave. Theyxe2x80x99ll offer you a 0% APR loan for up to $100. Itxe2x80x99s free if you wait for the ACH to clear, or you can get your funds instantly for $5. $5 to save a few days doesnxe2x80x99t feel outlandish, especially if you need that money now. However, if the life of that loan is 1 week, the $5 fee works out to a ~260% APR! It just doesnxe2x80x99t feel that way because itxe2x80x99s not marketed as such, and the fee is optional. This is even more pronounced with something like instant deposit on Venmo where you pay 1% to get your money ~2 days faster. Itxe2x80x99s definitely worth debating the ethics of this, but the fees are very transparent and easy to understand, and consumers seem to really love these offerings without resentment.More examples are everywherexe2x80xa6..Brex markets xe2x80x9c3-7x rewardsxe2x80x9d on various categories, but we know they are covering those expenses with 250 bps of interchange or less. That feels better than xe2x80x9c1% cash backxe2x80x9d or whatever the weighted average rewards math works out to. Robinhood offers Stock and crypto trading for xe2x80x9cfreexe2x80x9d, but we know that theyxe2x80x99re making the money in other ways behind the scenes. Wealthfront gives you xe2x80x9c$5,000 managed for freexe2x80x9d if you refer a friend, which is really just $12.The lesson to me is that the way you frame price and value are super important, even more so than the xe2x80x9cactualxe2x80x9d dollars and cents.An anti-pattern: LOTS of distribution models are workingItxe2x80x99s common that only 1-2 distribution methods will work for a given category. In social, EVERYONE was focused on address book invitations and social embedding for years. VCs exacerbate the problem with truisms like xe2x80x9cyou canxe2x80x99t build a successful business with paid acquisitionxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cB2B2C rarely works.xe2x80x9d Fintech has broken a lot of these mental models, and a wide array of distribution tactics have led to multi-billion dollar companies... Venmo and PayPal got to scale with viral, network driven growth.AfterPay and Affirm built huge consumer bases with B2B2C.Credit Karma, Chime, Lemonade, and Sofi got to scale with paid acquisition.Robinhood got to scale with disruptive pricing and word of mouth.Itxe2x80x99s a good reminder to stay open minded and curious about ways to be successful. In fintech there have been multiple paths...Previous interviews : Charlie Deutsch, GM of Financial Services at TrueAccordErica Dorfman, VP of Treasury & Payments at BrexNatasha Mascarenhas, Reporter at TechCrunchMary Ann Azevedo, Managing Editor of FinLedgerJackie Vullinghs, Principal at Sydney based AirTree VenturesKatie Perry, VP of Marketing at PublicJulia DeWahl, ex Chief of Staff at OpendoorJill Carlson, Principal at Slow VenturesBiz Carson, Reporter at ProtocolJack Altman, Cofounder & CEO of LatticeFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"A chat with Josh Schwarzapel, early web entrepreneur & fintech executive   - SarHaribhakti's Newsletter","url":"https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-josh-schwarzapel-early"}

Can you walk us through your career and how what youxe2x80x99ve learned in these experiences has led you to where you are today?Charlie : Absolutely! My goal after graduating was to get a job - any job - in financial services. I didnxe2x80x99t go to a top school, so it was an uphill battle for me. I ultimately landed at a lowly insurance company underwriting these esoteric AAA CDO bonds that were *supposedly* impervious to losses. Little did I know wexe2x80x99d underwritten many of the bonds that ultimately failed in the financial crisis.This was a formative experience in a few ways; the first is I came to realize FICO was not the end-all, be-all, in terms of predicting risk - after this I became obsessed with alternative credit scoring (more on that later). The other learning was personal; the people who caused financial destruction made a killing, while a lot of innocent bystanders lost their homes. I felt like I was on the wrong side - I wanted to be a value creator, not a value extractor. This is what moved me toward trying to help the little guy. I get excited by serving segments that are avoided by traditional financial services. I joined OnDeck early and built their direct origination muscle and partnerships business. Ixe2x80x99ve since helped consumers get financial services at Acorns and micro-enterprises get access to 1-click invoice financing with Wave. Now Ixe2x80x99m leading an initiative at TrueAccord to build products for our consumers. Itxe2x80x99s a unique opportunity to help a challenged segment and build a great business at the same time. We have a unique position in the market where wexe2x80x99re paid to help these consumers which means room for real financial product innovation, not just UX innovation. Sometimes, these things are confused.Sar : Can you expand on what you mean by conflating product innovation and UX innovation? Any historical examples come to mind?Charlie : Sure. The first phase of financial innovation is usually about making a bad experience more user friendly - say an instant loan or digital investment account. While it may represent a better experience, it often requires novel distribution - letxe2x80x99s say Facebook. At first, distribution is inexpensive, but as popularity grows competition drives up acquisition costs. Ultimately, the company must either shrink margins or these pass costs to the customer. Since venture-backed companies often have negative margins to begin with - and raise money on the hope of margin expansion - itxe2x80x99s typically the latter outcome.There are two ways to solve this challenge. The first is to introduce a novel business model - like generating revenue off your customer base, but not your customers. Payment for order flow (Robinhood) or unregulated debit (Chime) are two examples of this. The second is structural - if you can eliminate your acquisition costs, it gives you a competitive advantage to offer the same product at a lower price because the customer has already bought something from you (Square Capital) or what wexe2x80x99re working on at TrueAccord fits into this model.Sar : Tell us a bit about what youxe2x80x99re building at TrueAccord? You guys are working on very unsexy but important problems. What do we have to know to appreciate what you are doing matters?Charlie : TrueAccord is a great opportunity to help a segment thatxe2x80x99s been left behind. Most new credit products fall into the category of xe2x80x9cnew to creditxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9ccredit buildingxe2x80x9d for consumers looking to open their first line and establish a history. The consumers wexe2x80x99re serving come through our core business - this means theyxe2x80x99ve used credit before, and it hasnxe2x80x99t gone well for them.While this is a challenging customer to serve, we have a few advantages. The first is consumers love working with us - our CEO likes to say our reviews are xe2x80x9cshockingly goodxe2x80x9d for the business wexe2x80x99re in and itxe2x80x99s true. The second dynamic is we have what amounts to a negative acquisition cost - we get paid to help these customers. These factors allow us to design products that most closely serve the needs of our customers, knowing we donxe2x80x99t start in the red. Sar : How has the landscape of lending products from non banking companies evolved over the past decade?Charlie : Itxe2x80x99s evolved a lot. In 2008 banks were in balance sheet repair mode - consumers and SMEs were starved for capital, and a lot of mortgage and ABS buyers were in search of yield. The resulting vacuum yielded the xe2x80x9ctech-enabled lendersxe2x80x9d like LendingClub, Prosper, OnDeck and Kabbage. The model was simple - rapid digital fulfillment for a premium cost product. It flourished for a few years but in 2015-ish the market realized capital is a commodity and there are no barriers to entry. The subsequent venture goldrush drove acquisition costs through the rough.While these lenders were slugging it out, payment platforms like Square and PayPal realized their customers wanted capital, and the embedded nature of their products solved the retention challenge. They also moved the money, which they used as an additional risk management tool. Since lending wasnxe2x80x99t their core business and they didnxe2x80x99t have acquisition costs,  they didnxe2x80x99t need to lend to everybody - only their best customers - and it strengthened these relationships. The model has proliferated and every relevant payment provider offers it today.On the consumer side, Buy Now Pay Later  and Earned Wage Access have been the areas of explosive growth. Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay realized merchants would subsidize rates in exchange for increased conversion and basket size, making the product a viable alternative to traditional credit cards. As a byproduct, these companies also solved the distribution model that plagued the original tech-enabled lenders in a defensible, embedded way. EWA companies like Even and EarnIn give employees instant access to their income, but they are ultimately taking risk to corporates, so itxe2x80x99s not rocket science from an underwriting perspective.Now businesses like Clearbanc and Pipe are taking a novel approach to whatxe2x80x99s old-fashioned factoring. The innovation is about directing funds, using scalable electronic data, and being further up the waterfall with a shorter feedback loop. While they have a tech flavor, these companies will ultimately be viewed as specialty finance lenders in my opinion, which makes them less desirable from a valuation perspective. Donxe2x80x99t get me wrong, these can be highly profitable businesses, they just wonxe2x80x99t ever trade at 100x revenues!Sar : That was a great explainer of the multiple waves of lending products we have seen over the past decade. You mentioned there was a reckoning of sorts in 2015 when the tech zeitgeist collectively realized the commodified nature, rising acquisition costs, and lower barriers to entry in the market of pure lending plays. LendingClub and OnDeck went public in 2014. In a lot of ways, the idea of embedded lending has been popularized by people who have seen the  distribution challenges of pure lending startups play out in 2010-2015. Do you believe we are repeating the market cycle of lending in the challenger banks market over the past 2 years? Especially right now in a low interest environment where both high savings yield consumer value proposition and the core interchange based biz model are challenged.  There are a handful of strong growing players like Chime, Varo, Current in the US. Charlie : Itxe2x80x99s at least a reasonable question to ask. Neo-banks exist due to an exclusion in Dodd-Frank called xe2x80x9cUnregulated Interchangexe2x80x9d created to protect small businesses from large banks who were charging credit interchange for debit transactions (the former has chargeback risk, the latter does not.) The loop-hole allows sub $10BN banks to charge ~10x on debit. But once deposits exceed $10BN, youxe2x80x99re technically no longer exempt. To further protect this advantage, many neo-banks use distributed deposits. What that means is the $5,000 you have on deposit is actually spread across many small banks, allowing neo-bank to claim a much smaller deposit base than if they were concentrated on their own balance sheet (or really their partner bankxe2x80x99s).It will be interesting to see how public markets view these models. Ixe2x80x99d expect them to ask two questions; the first is how durable is the exemption because if the loop-hole is closed, they will lose 80%+ of their revenue. You have to wonder how the banking lobby will feel about it - and it wonxe2x80x99t just be the big banks. The second question is whether investors will be comfortable with more and more of the neo-banks revenue mix coming from lending. The purpose of having a long-term banking relationship is to access other (credit) products so customers will eventually want to borrow. Chime seems likely to go first so wexe2x80x99ll learn from their experience, but their CEO is definitely working to establish the narrative they are a payments company, not a bank.Sar : You mentioned startups taking a differentiated approach to old fashioned factoring earlier.  Therexe2x80x99s always a visceral reaction from management teams at next gen lenders for ecommerce brands (Clearbanc et al) or SaaS companies (Pipe, Capchase) to being branded as factoring lenders. How much do you believe that flows from a regulatory angle?Charlie : This is mostly about crafting a narrative they are a tech company, not a specialty finance company, deserving of a tech multiple. The irony is from a regulatory perspective, these companies likely work hard to be classified as a factoring business, not a lender, as itxe2x80x99s quite beneficial in easing regulatory and compliance burdens vs lending. Unless you classify yourself, a regulator will do it for you, so you canxe2x80x99t ignore the issue.Sar : How did online lending companies like OnDeck go about building their underwriting models and raising money in their first 2-3 years? My understanding is companies used their equity funds to prove out their models and then try to find capital providers for raising debt funds to scale up.Charlie : Yes - for pure lenders like OnDeck, the model required an on balance sheet xe2x80x9ctest and learnxe2x80x9d approach. Generate 1-2 performance vintages to show a debt provider you could execute the lending mechanic with stable performance, and you could get an advance rate structure.For established companies looking to add lending as a complimentary business, even though most can raise debt up front, itxe2x80x99s advantageous for them to fund the first few vintages on balance sheet, as it gives them the flexibility to try whatever it is they want from a product perspective.This is how wexe2x80x99re approaching new product development at TrueAccord - while we have access to debt, we have some novel ideas for how to best design for our customersxe2x80x99 needs, and we want to iterate quickly without any unnecessary constraints created by third party structures.Sar : How has the landscape of fundraising options for lending products evolved from 10 years ago?Charlie : The capital side of the market evolved quite a bit. After the financial crisis, there were a slew of mortgage, ABS and whole loan funds who were looking for yield. They were open to financing nascent products as long as they were priced to multiples of expected defaults and they offered low advance rates (the term for how much equity the originator needed to contribute per loan.) Some of these forward thinking players also got creative and negotiated equity kickers in the form of warrants in the case these tech-enabled lenders became valuable. In the mid 2010s these structures became more standard and there were funds who became focused players in this space, like Victory Park, but they werenxe2x80x99t typically the first capital in - you had to prove a model on your own balance sheet using equity, first. Now there are funds specifically designed for this. While Ixe2x80x99ve not met them, I know CoVenture looks to invest both equity and debt into companies looking to unlock new asset classes. Itxe2x80x99s an interesting model, but I think we need to be cautious about thinking every business should be a lending business.Sar : Therexe2x80x99s a running joke in fintech circles that everyone wants to be a payments company. You mentioned people should be careful about wanting every business to be lending business. Can you expand on why you think that? Charlie : Sure. Software businesses and lending businesses are antithetical. Software businesses are valued based on growth and negative retention, while lending businesses are valued based on profitability. You must also grow a lending business in a controlled manner, which is somewhat opposite to the ideals of the high-growth venture world. The outcomes of the first cohort of tech-enabled lenders demonstrate this risk. Ultimately, public markets viewed these companies as specialty finance businesses, not tech, and it had serious consequences for valuations. Overnight they had to change the way they did everything - no more R&D, no more investing in growth - they had to become profitable overnight. It slammed the brakes on these companies while other companies picked up market share.This is a key learning for me - and I tell anyone who is thinking about lending - that it makes a phenomenal accelerent or complementary business, but you canxe2x80x99t lend to everyone. If you do, it makes you a lender, not a tech company. Square has done a great job of finding a balance here - they lend to their best 10-15% of their customers, and these customers pay this off by staying and growing their payments volume.Sar : I always say lending is a very difficult primary business but a great secondary business if its growth is not directly linked to the growth of a company. I definitely agree with you on that. I think there is a wide gap between when software companies decide to spin up a lending business and when they actually are ready to scale it up. The first step is almost always doing a pilot with your own capital to test and learn. But, the next step is where it gets all murky. Therexe2x80x99s cap raise, legal, logistical challenges. Charlie : Assuming it makes sense to lend to your customers, Ixe2x80x99d bifurcate the approach based on whether or not the company is already in the business of moving money. At Wave, we were a PayFac, so it was easy to simply xe2x80x9cturn things onxe2x80x9d from a lending perspective. We had all the functionality around funds flows, reconciliation, etc. that is necessary to spin up lending activities.For non-payments companies, there are a growing number of lending-as-a-service offerings that are turnkey and prevent you from having to build a lot of complex software from scratch. At the moment, Ixe2x80x99m looking at a few of these providers and Ixe2x80x99m astonished how far things have since when I joined OnDeck - we had very limited options and had to start with a clunky core processor. Now there are API-based servicing solutions which you can spin up in weeks, which prevent you from having to make major investment in infrastructure to be a compliant lender.Sar : You mentioned disrupting FICO - why havenxe2x80x99t we seen this happen?Charlie : Great question - the direct reason is the creation of the Basel Accords. Unless youxe2x80x99ve spent a lot of time on bank liquidity management, you probably havenxe2x80x99t heard of them, but they govern how much capital a bank is required to hold for each asset. These risk-weightings are determined by rating agencies, and ratings are heavily influenced by commonly accepted metrics like FICO. In my opinion, this is what forces FICO usage downstream. More importantly, itxe2x80x99s now my perspective that the type of Fintech organizations who would have the influence to drive this change donxe2x80x99t actually care to do so. Theyxe2x80x99ve realized what makes an embedded lending model shine is an orthogonal data set - unrelated to credit - that sheds more a more nuanced light on risk than the common credit score. In the late 90s, merchant cash advance companies figured out processing data and transaction elasticity were much more important than a personal credit. FICO was useful for exclusions, but not for inclusions. Now companies like Clearbanc can advance funds, dictate your spend, and tap into your revenue stream before youxe2x80x99ve even fulfilled your order. Sar : What skill sets should software companies be hiring for to go from an idea to implementation when thinking about using lending as a growth driver?Charlie : Taking a traditional risk management approach to these sorts of products does not make sense. For the type of products wexe2x80x99re discussing, lending is much more of a data and design business, than a xe2x80x9ccredit riskxe2x80x9d business. You create effective credit products by understanding your user motivations and behaviors, and aligning the offerings within this context. Square personified this concept, by creating a zero friction product - essentially, they said xe2x80x9cwe have your entire application on hand, so wexe2x80x99re just going to run it for you and tell you if you are approved.xe2x80x9d This was a very novel concept, but one that made a lot of sense. Buy Now Pay Later companies also represent a great example of this - you create a win-win experience for both consumer and merchant by reducing credit friction - and really the traditional cost of underwriting.Previous interviews : Erica Dorfman, VP of Treasury & Payments at BrexNatasha Mascarenhas, Reporter at TechCrunchMary Ann Azevedo, Managing Editor of FinLedgerJackie Vullinghs, Principal at Sydney based AirTree VenturesKatie Perry, VP of Marketing at PublicJulia DeWahl, ex Chief of Staff at OpendoorJill Carlson, Principal at Slow VenturesBiz Carson, Reporter at ProtocolJack Altman, Cofounder & CEO of Lattice For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"A chat with Charlie Deutsch, GM of Financial Services at TrueAccord - SarHaribhakti's Newsletter","url":"https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-charlie-deutsch-gm-of"}

Whether itxe2x80x99s Hollywood or Wall Street, Silicon Valley is always in a race to figure out how those worlds work before they figure out technology. What were the cultural differences between the two worlds? Erica : From my experience, the primary cultural differences come from being able to act quickly. Traditional finance businesses tend to move more slowly, whether due to process, more cumbersome tech to build on, or regulatory requirements. Executing and building quickly on new ideas is the hallmark of successful startup companies, and that creates an entirely different working environment. Flexibility and creativity become incredibly important, along with working collaboratively across very different parts of the organization. Personally, what I have enjoyed most about working on the operating side versus the advisory or investing side is the sense of being part of a team and really building towards a goal xe2x80x93 even when you are working in different areas, everyone wins when any individual project is successful. Itxe2x80x99s incredibly fun. Sar : You are the VP of Treasury & Payments at Brex, which includes the Capital Markets team, which you previously co-headed at SoFi. Can you walk us through what your role entails and how it ladders up to the mission of companies you have worked at? A 101 on the distinction between Capital Markets and Treasury would be helpful too! I think most readers would be familiar with the Financial Planning and Analytics function at a company. Erica : Companies that have a lending component to them often require outside capital in the form of debt in order to more efficiently manage their balance sheet. The Capital Markets team is responsible for working with external investors and banking partners on different funding sources and strategies. It typically sits inside the Finance team, but separate from the FP&A team, which is responsible for working across the organization to come up with projections and analyze business performance. Treasury is a separate function that is responsible for managing how and where the companyxe2x80x99s funds are stored xe2x80x93 sometimes this sits in FP&A, sometimes in Accounting, and for us, it covers liquidity management and sits together with Capital Markets. Sar : Brex started out as a corporate card for startups and later introduced vertical products to serve categories like ecommerce brands and life sciences. Cash management was launched around this time last year. Now, Brex has expanded its vision to become the financial OS for the next generation of businesses. Can you explain the evolution of what you guys have been working on? Erica : Wexe2x80x99re really excited about the evolution of our offering. Brex has always been focused on being more than a payments and credit card company, even from our initial product which incorporated tools and software to help companies manage their expenses. Our goal is to enable businesses to grow. To do that, wexe2x80x99re expanding on what wexe2x80x99ve built today and giving companies a platform to better and more easily manage their business - from our payments, credit, and cash management solutions, to spend management, billing, and visibility. Finance teams historically have had to bounce around numerous tools and services to get their job done and have visibility into their company. Brex is building so that companies can come to one place and experience everything seamlessly, giving teams time back to focus on managing their business. Sar : Therexe2x80x99s a wave of startups trying to build software for FP&A teams. You brought up how finance teams have to use fragmented systems to do their work. Do you believe Brexxe2x80x99s evolution of offerings means who you are building for is slowly changing from corporate card users across an organization to a functional team? Erica : Itxe2x80x99s a really exciting space right now. At Brex wexe2x80x99ve always built our product both for the users of the card, and for the finance teams managing them on the company side. Take for example one of our features at launch, text receipt matching and capture. While this is great for the card user, saving them time from having to manage receipt submission and approvals, itxe2x80x99s also a huge benefit for the finance team because adherence to policies increases, and it automates much of the wrangling that previously existed when matching charges to receipts, which is required for audits and reconciliations. Brexxe2x80x99s software on the Cash side and controls and expense management on the Card side tend to be more focused on the finance teams, enabling them to work more efficiently to schedule payments and monitor their business. So I would say itxe2x80x99s more of a continuation of what wexe2x80x99ve been building from the start. Sar : When the pandemic hit and a large swath of companies saw customer demand fall off a cliff, you guys had a front row seat to what was going on in real time in the broader economy. Can you give us a glimpse into what it was like internally back in March and April?Erica : It was definitely concerning to see the potential impact of the pandemic in March and April, there was so much uncertainty around how people and businesses would adapt. Brex was extremely well positioned from a capital perspective xe2x80x93 we had just completed a large equity round and had significant capacity on our borrowing facilities. When it became clear that the pandemic was going to be more than a passing week or two, we went into action mode and deployed resources across the company to do whatever we could to be proactive. Our chief concern was making sure that we were able to support our customers with continued credit in a sustainable way. We accelerated a number of projects with the product, data, and engineering teams that magnified the impact of our operations and servicing groups through automation, for example adding more live connections into underwriting data for our ecommerce customers, and started working with customers as early as possible to get a sense of their needs. We saw decreases in spending from customers during the first few months of the pandemic, as everyone was adjusting to the new normal and being conservative from a corporate finance standpoint, but thankfully that recovered well by June.Sar : What are some optimistic trends you are seeing across your customer base this quarter?Erica : Spend and engagement with our Cash product are probably the two most optimistic trends for me. On spend, customers are performing well from a credit perspective, and are continuing to increase their budgets for advertising, software etc. - that is a great trend to have continued, especially in these times. We are building overall to make sure that Brex is able to scale with our customers, so seeing companies do this is great. For Cash, we have released a lot of features this year, with the goal of giving customers a product that does everything that a traditional bank account can do and more. Seeing utilization of features that exist across banking products, like scheduled payments, is great, but Ixe2x80x99m especially optimistic about customers adopting our more innovative solutions through Cash, like instant payouts for ecommerce customers. That has been fun to watch customers use and get excited about. Sar : You served as Head of Finance at Tally. You went from building credit products for consumers to building credit products for companies. What are the similarities and differences between those two experiences?Erica : In a lot of ways, companies act like consumers, particularly for smaller companies, and share similar needs when it comes to looking for an easy to use, automated, and value added financial experience. Brex approaches our business customers much more like a consumer company xe2x80x93 we are aiming to enhance the experience and output of the individuals and teams running finance. Companies tend to be more conservative on planning and risk because their capital is often from outside investors and there are other individuals, like employees and customers, who could be impacted. Companies also have a longer list of formal financial management needs, like monthly cash reconciliations, and use data differently than consumers, for example linking different spend to accounting software and tracking expense categories to map with metrics like CAC or payback period. Sar : What do you think is under-appreciated about the mechanics of setting up lending business by software companies?Erica : As the industry has expanded, the impact of tech serving fintechs has probably been underappreciated. For example, software providing more automated KYC checks, improving data linking (like Plaid), and enabling fraud detection, all automate pieces of customer onboarding that would have previously been manual or required in-house software development and risk algorithms. It is a lot easier to get a lending business off the ground today than it was in 2010, and you can see that just in the sheer number of companies launching with lending products. This doesnxe2x80x99t mean itxe2x80x99s easy, and I think the challenge can often be what to do once you have the capacity to lend - getting the partner or debt capital to scale can sometimes be harder than getting the equity to launch. When going through due diligence with credit investors and banks, companies are tasked with comparing their performance to the overall market and to borrowers with similar loans or in similar industries. This can be difficult if youxe2x80x99re trying to innovate on new underwriting data or risk evaluation mechanics. It can take longer than expected to get these agreements finalized and to get partners comfortable with taking on a new form of credit risk. Sar : Compared to other early stage companies, finance teams are less detached from the other teams at fintech companies with lending products because of the risk, capital and compliance requirements. How do you make sure there is a strong alignment across product development, sales, marketing and finance functions? Sales and Finance teams are often in conflict because they are optimizing for different metrics and priorities. Sales cares about quotas while Finance cares about cost of capital, payback, CAC, defaults. The cost of not having cross functional alignment is often higher at fintech companies than at traditional software companies. Erica : That is a great point around finance teams at a fintech, it can often work to your advantage. For us, we have a captive user testing base in our Accounting team which is amazing. They frequently work with our product and engineering teams on development. On goals and potential conflicts, I think this is applicable for almost all companies, and certainly every team has their own areas of focus. For us, setting objectives and goals as a company enables teams to work well together because everyone understands and is aligned on the overall target. We have check-ins on progress that include all of the stakeholders, so if, for example, we are hitting targets on adding more customers, but are missing on losses or cost of acquisition, that isnxe2x80x99t a win for the company, and the conversation and discussion happens with all of the groups together. Itxe2x80x99s not great if wexe2x80x99re over or under performing on any individual goal because they are actually intended to work together in balance, so making sure that everyone agrees on the targets upfront is an important part of getting to the right outcome when wexe2x80x99re executing.  Sar : You strike me as a finance person with great product instincts. Are you guys intentional about cultivating a culture where the people who deal with what technologists often consider boring work build better product instincts over time? Is that a consideration in hiring? It is very common to see a cultural divide where a finance team is just thinking in numbers and is unable to use similar instincts and language as the rest of the org that does the building and marketing.Erica : We really value working cross functionally and internal mobility, actually the product team has a lot of individuals who have been in other parts of the organization - from business development, to operations, to finance. We try to hire people who are thoughtful team players, and that often means they are really excited to think about ways to improve our product and customer experience, regardless of which team theyxe2x80x99re on. We actually just finished our annual internal hackathon, where teams come together across the organization, and a few of the winning teams had contributors from accounting and risk. Sar : Whose work do you admire at other companies in a similar role? Any advice for people with traditional finance backgrounds looking to jump into startups wanting to do what you are doing? Erica : There are a lot of strong individuals in the space xe2x80x93 I really admire teams working on innovative products like those at Divvy Homes. The best advice I can give is to do research on what areas of fintech youxe2x80x99re most excited about, and then get in touch with people at the companies in that space. The biggest transition can be what stage of business youxe2x80x99re joining, and what the role entails xe2x80x93 itxe2x80x99s often very different from traditional finance xe2x80x93 so talking to people at these companies about their experience is helpful.

A lot has been written by lots of smart people about how SMBs all over the country and the world have struggled this year because of the pandemic. When a business is predicated on human proximity at a specific place at a specific time, it is not surprising that it will struggle when a pandemic has made the notion of human proximity so risky.There is no way to overestimate the hardships SMBs have gone through this year. That being said, there is a silver lining. Businesses all over the country are now investing more than ever before in their long term endurance and growth!What I want to do here is curate statements made by companies to show how an unprecedented wave of digital transformation amongst SMBs across all sectors is underway.I love to get a sense of whatxe2x80x99s going on using bottom-up research instead of top down macro data. I find it more interesting and instructive to triangulate how well category leading companies using software to solve problems for SMBs are doing to get a pulse on what's really going on beyond the headlines. Why do SMBs matter? SMBs drive more than 50% of employment in the private sector and account for more than 40% of the American economy.Letxe2x80x99s dive in Sheryl Hoskins, CEO of Upserve, an inventory management and point of sale company told Protocol : Since early March, our customer adoption of online ordering increased 400%, and the sales our customers were generating online ordering increased a little over 700%Alex Taussig, a General Partner at Lightspeed Ventures and Board of Director at wholesale marketplace Faire : Faire saw its business rapidly bounce back in late Q2. On average, its customers are now growing YoY despite the ongoing pandemic, and Fairexe2x80x99s business more than tripled YoY in Q3. The recovery was driven by the adaptation of Fairexe2x80x99s customers to the post-COVID environment, and by the consolidation of the wholesale channel onto Faire.From Squarexe2x80x99s payments report in September : Since the onset of COVID-19, consumers have become less reliant on cash.Among payments transacted at Square sellers nationally since February 2020, the share of cash transactions decreased from 37% in February to 33% in April, and held stable at 33% through the end of August, proving that the onset of COVID-19 has affected consumer behavior.By comparison, during that same time period in 2019, the share of cash transactions increased slightly, from 39.9% in February to 40.0% in August.Jeff Wilke, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer, in their 2020 impact report : Since the pandemic hit, third-party sellers have had record sales. Their products continue to account for more than 50% of all units sold in our online stores, and their sales continue to outpace our first-party sales.During the 12 months ending May 31, American SMBs sold more than 3.4 billion products in our stores, and averaged 6,500 products sold per minuteAmerican SMBs had an average of $160,000 in sales xe2x80x93 up year-over-year from about $100,000.The number of American SMBs that surpassed $1 million in sales grew by more than 20%.Amazon SMB sellers are based in all fifty states. Forty-seven states are home to more than 1,000 sellers, while twenty-six states have more than 5,000 sellers. SMB sellers in Iowa, Washington, and Alabama had the fastest growing sales between June 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020John Foreman, Chief Product Officer at Mailchimp, told Protocol :During the first few months of the pandemic, businesses made that switch like never before, with 60% of new websites built on Mailchimp's tool coming from new users. In April, the average time it took businesses to publish their first website fell by over 50%.Etsy quarterly earnings in August  : Etsy saw an influx of 18.7 million new buyers and reactivated buyers - those who havenxe2x80x99t purchased in a year or more.GMS growth excluding mask sales for the Etsy marketplace was 93%, up $1.0 billion year-over-year, and 14% of the Etsy marketplacexe2x80x99s overall GMS was from mask sales. Excluding masks, homewares and home furnishings, top category was up 128% year-over year, jewelry and accessories was up 50%, and craft supplies was up 138%.110,000 Etsy sellers sold a total of 29 million face masks worth $346 millionIntuit quarterly earnings in August : Revenue for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the year. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter, including 4 points of non-recurring revenue from the Paycheck Protection Program and 31% for the year.Now seeing recovering trends across our platform including improved retention rates, payments volume and employees paid with our payroll offerings, as customers continue to rely on QuickBooks as the source of truth for their business.Yancey Spruill, CEO of Digital Ocean, told Protocol : According to our recent survey, since the pandemic began, more than 60% of SMBs have expanded or upgraded cloud usage. If that signals one thing, it's that cloud is not only the lifeline these organizations need now, but also the competitive advantage they can leverage to help grow their businesses and power their ideas in the future.GoDaddyxe2x80x99s global survey : The United States (U.S.) has been among the most affected by the pandemic, yet U.S. very small business owners surveyed were among the most likely to exhibit optimism about recovery with 36 percent expecting recovery in three months or less (compared to 26 percent globally). For example, U.S. entrepreneurs were among the least likely to report a decline in revenues (66 percent to 75 percent globally) and were the most confident their businesses would thrive in the future. They were also among the least likely to report receiving COVID-related governmental assistance (76 percent to 68 percent globally).Hello Alice and GGV Capitalxe2x80x99s SMB Impact survey : 83% believe their business will perform better in 2021 than in 202093% plan to hire in 2021 compared to 45% that laid off employees in 2020 75% intend to spend more on technology in 2021 than in 2020This is just a short non exhaustive list of SMB focused companies doing well. It is clear that we are living through a wholesale adoption of technology in a segment of businesses not historically known to adopt technology easily or quickly. It is definitely not easy to be an SMB right now. The big guys are getting bigger!  But, you would much rather be an SMB during a pandemic this year than any other time in history!Ixe2x80x99ll end with these words of optimism from GGV Capital : Five to ten years ago, it would have been very difficult for an SMB to compete. Today, itxe2x80x99s a different story. Innovation and scale from SMBTech leaders means new upstarts can deploy and leverage comparable tech stacks on Day 1. Want to launch a new, local authentic pizza restaurant? Create a web site with Wix, offer your customers ordering via the Slice mobile app, POS from Square and online marketing from Hubspot. Not only is it doable, itxe2x80x99s far easier and cheaper than ever before to adopt and leverage technology as an SMB. As a result, we anticipate almost every business started in the post-C19 era will be built on a modern xe2x80x9cSMBTech Stackxe2x80x9d on Day 1. Youxe2x80x99d be crazy to do it otherwise.Can SMBxe2x80x99s survive in a xe2x80x9cbig tech / big brandxe2x80x9d world? It wonxe2x80x99t be easy. But again, we arenxe2x80x99t starting from scratch. Shopifyxe2x80x99s annual GMV (gross merchandise sales by merchants on its platform) was $125 million in 2010 xe2x80x93 this year it will be over $120 billion. Amazon reported $54 billion in third party provider revenue on its platform in 2019, eBay $90 billion, Etsyxe2x80x99s GMV run rate is $10 billion, and restaurant focused platforms like Toast and Slice are both on track to handle billions in GMV in 2021. Net/net hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for SMBxe2x80x99s is now flowing through established and thriving platforms that barely existed a decade ago (eBay and Amazon existed, but the SMB portion of their platforms have grown by $100B+ in a decade).For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Generational SMB digital transformation - SarHaribhakti's Newsletter","url":"https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/generational-smb-digital-transformation"}

Was it a big culture shock? The mindset required to excel in those worlds are very different. What were the first few months like?Jackie : The biggest culture shock was the hours - on the trading floor I was used to waking up at 5.30am, being at the desk by 6.30am. At Kalo in London everyone arrived at 10am so I could wake up at a sensible time and exercise before work, it felt like such a luxury.I also had to learn to work in a team for the first time xe2x80x94 I was running my own business on the trading floor and it was very self-directed, as long as youxe2x80x99re making more money every year and not breaking any rules youxe2x80x99re left to yourself. I had to learn how to work closely with others to manage longer term projects with competing priorities and multiple dependencies. The best part was the motivation shift. I came from an industry in structural decline to one where the world was filled with opportunity. That energy is addictive and itxe2x80x99s the reason Ixe2x80x99ll stay in tech for the rest of my career. Sar : You later moved to Australia and have been an investor at Sydney-based AirTree Ventures. What debates or narratives on US tech twitter chatter donxe2x80x99t resonate with you? Jackie : Itxe2x80x99s hard to generalise, but US tech twitter feels much more hype-driven xe2x80x94 some trend or company is the future of technology for a minute, then a few months later itxe2x80x99s completely forgotten. Everything from xf0x9fx91x81xefxb8x8fxf0x9fx91x84xf0x9fx91x81xefxb8x8f  to whether or not DTC e-commerce is a venture-scale business model. I even had to block xe2x80x9cremote workxe2x80x9d on Twitter in March.Itxe2x80x99s also surprising how little US tech twitter talks about the rest of the world. Itxe2x80x99s almost as if the only history is US history, the only politics is US domestic politics (or other countriesxe2x80x99 trading relationships with the US) and the only tech companies that really get attention (until theyxe2x80x99re huge) are US companies. Sar : Itxe2x80x99s hard not to agree with you on tech twitter being hype driven. Itxe2x80x99s a lot of memes. Once an idea gets traction amongst a small circle of insiders online or offline, you start seeing lots of people tweet about it. Itxe2x80x99s sort of a race to the bottom where you donxe2x80x99t want to not be associated with whatxe2x80x99s hot!On the flip side, what are some things in the American tech culture that deeply resonate with you? I believe diversity in venture capital is just as big an issue there as well. Jackie : I love the culture of possibility xe2x80x94 if you can dream it you can create it, and no ambition is too great. That is uniquely American and in my opinion is still why the US private sector leads the world in technological innovation (for now).I also love the culture of sharing and building upon each otherxe2x80x99s ideas, Ixe2x80x99ve learned so much from the US tech and finance communities on Twitter. On your point about diversity - itxe2x80x99s a problem everywhere in the world, but it seems like the industry is shifting quicker in Australia than in the US. At AirTree, we have 40% women on the investment team and xe2x85x93 xe2x80x9cnon-Westernxe2x80x9d ethnic background and you can feel the sense of obligation all the VC funds have locally to open up opportunities to under-represented groups. Wexe2x80x99re also hearing more founders express their desire for diversity on their board. Sar : What made you caveat what makes the US lead in innovation with xe2x80x9cfor nowxe2x80x9d?Jackie : The Chinese government dictates the allocation of resources across the public and private sector, and itxe2x80x99s clear that leadership is prioritising R&D investment in areas like artificial intelligence and renewable energy, so itxe2x80x99ll be interesting to see how those infrastructure and deep tech investments impact development at the services layer over the next 5-10 years. The consumer apps Ixe2x80x99m following increasingly come from Asia as well xe2x80x94 from Pinduoduo to TikTok and Tencentxe2x80x99s gaming empire. Sar : When people in the States think about Australian tech scene, we largely associate it with Atlassian and Canva (Afterpay is top of mind for the fintech people). Both of them are very successful, get press coverage here, play into the thematic memes of their categories and have had cap tables filled with high profile SV based venture firms. Why do we not hear about Australian companies a lot more in the zeitgeist here? Are there some structural or cultural reasons? I know a lot of SV players are now investing globally and many are building relationships in Sydney and Melbourne. But, the Australian startup stories donxe2x80x99t seem to breakthrough here the way Indian and Chinese startups stories do!Jackie : We all live in filter bubbles and only hear about startups if the people we follow online or the media write about it. You will only hear about early stage companies in another region if you follow people in the region who would talk about them online, while the media will usually only write about the startups that raise large rounds, have high profile SV funds investing, or have become the category leader in their space. Which is why thatxe2x80x99s been limited for Australia xe2x80x94  there simply havenxe2x80x99t been that many $50m+ revenue companies yet. Thatxe2x80x99s changing quickly though, keep your eye on companies like A Cloud Guru, Linktree, AirWallex, Culture Amp, Go1 and Secure Code Warrior.Sar : I saw an amazing Australian edtech startup called Forage raise Series A from SV based Lightspeed Ventures the other day. Can you give us an overview of the venture ecosystem in the Australian tech hubs? Therexe2x80x99s always a subtle rivalry between ecosystems where the outside investors start crowding out the local investors using their brands. We see this dynamic domestically in the States where SV giants start picking up a lot of hot deals in LA, NYC and all over the country. Do you see this play out between cities domestically and nationally (with SV capital flowing in)? A deficit of capital and risk-taking in certain sectors or stages in a city often exasperates this. Jackie : There are three larger VC funds in ANZ xe2x80x94 AirTree, Blackbird and Square Peg xe2x80x94 then a range of smaller funds. We donxe2x80x99t yet have the hyper-competitiveness of the US, but wexe2x80x99re starting to see SV giants invest at seed stage in ANZ (Bessemer investing US$1.2m in Portainer, Accel investing US$2.2m in Pyn), which is putting the right pressure on us to have conviction and invest early. We donxe2x80x99t usually see those larger US VCs as competition though. We often co-invest, which gives founders the combination of local help using our networks in ANZ for hiring, BD, founder intros and someone at the end of the phone in their timezone, while also getting help from experienced US VCs as they expand into the US.Sar : I enjoyed your deep dives on companies like Square and Spotify. I'm sure you are aware of the brewing world of business analysis in Substack newsletters on American tech twitter. There has been an explosion lately! Do you see this phenomenon in your world too? Is there a strong appetite for this type of content in the Australian tech scene? What drives you to do such deep dives? Jackie : I started writing to help me think more clearly and mostly did deep dives into different sectors initially (fintech, health, consumer brands etc). About six months ago I decided I wanted to start investing in listed tech stocks again and thought that if I was going to do all the research on whether to invest I may as well write an investment paper at the end to save others doing the work. The deep dives I publish publicly are very similar to the investment theses we write internally for potential startup investments, but by making them public I can get feedback on my thinking from the whole world vs just my team at AirTree, which is fun. In terms of Aussie appetite for content - I think people working in tech all over the world have a similar culture of curiosity and ambition, reading and learning as much as they can from anyone who can share lessons learned. Most of the best content to date is from the US and so inevitably has a US lens on the business model, so hopefully I can provide some Aussie flavour where itxe2x80x99s useful, which is mostly in regulation-heavy industries like finance and healthcare. Sar : As a fellow fintech geek, I liked your blog post about fintech opportunities in Australia. You break down the product categories and list out both local and overseas startups. Are there any quirks in product development, business models, target audiences or growth models in the hot categories of fintech that you think would be foreign to people outside of Australia? Jackie : The US is such a unique beast in fintech xe2x80x94 getting started is hard because of the regulatory complexity, but the existing system is so much more broken than in most other parts of the world and the margins are so much greater than in Europe or ANZ. As an example, in the UK and in Australia you rarely pay a bank fee, can sign up for an account online, and can transfer money instantly between banks for free. This makes it much harder for neobanks to compete with the established banks. Interchange is also significantly higher in the US which means companies like Chime and Divvy can succeed by only monetising through interchange, which isnxe2x80x99t possible in Australia and means that our fintechs need to get into subscriptions or lending much quicker to get to sustainable unit economics. Wexe2x80x99re just at the start of that journey in Aus, but in the UK Revolut already has several subscription tiers, while Monzo recently launched lending for its Personal account and subscriptions for Business. Sar : What are your content recommendations for people who want to get more educated on the early stage startup scene, emerging trends and mature tech companies in Australia? Jackie : The technology section of the Australian Financial Review and Sydney Morning Herald usually cover the bigger funding announcements as well as the news on the more established Aussie tech companies. We also have smaller startup-focused websites like Smart Company and Startup Daily. And sign up to my Substack :)Sar : As a consumer, what products would you recommend us to check out? I would imagine there are some product experiences or design paradigms that are somewhat foreign to people who exclusively use apps and websites built in their home countries.Jackie : It could be difficult to get access from abroad, but Up Bank is the best neobank UX Ixe2x80x99ve seen globally, incorporating delight and games at every opportunity within the product. Ixe2x80x99m also obsessed with our portfolio company Linktreexe2x80x99s design ethos and UX at the moment xe2x80x94 theyxe2x80x99re relentlessly focused on simplicity, revealing the depth of functionality and integrations only at the moment the user needs it, which leads to some truly magical moments when you reveal a YouTube or Twitch stream, and will extend so much further in the future. Previous interviews : Katie Perry, VP of Marketing at PublicJulia DeWahl, ex Chief of Staff at OpendoorJill Carlson, Principal at Slow VenturesBiz Carson, Reporter at ProtocolJack Altman, Cofounder & CEO of LatticeNatasha Mascarenhas, Reporter at TechCrunchMary Ann Azevedo, Managing Editor of FinLedgerFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Enjoyed this one Sar!

You have reported for Forbes and Crunchbase News. I discovered you and your news outlet FinLedger on Twitter. What was the motivation behind wanting to build a new fintech-focused outlet? Fintech coverage has been beefing up at multiple tech-focused and general news outlets over the past few years. As a managing editor, what is your vision for this outlet? What sort of audience are you hoping to build?Mary : Someone I interviewed recently said to me: xe2x80x9cToday, fintech is all the rage.xe2x80x9d And while I agree with that sentiment, I would argue that whatxe2x80x99s happening in fintech today goes way beyond any fleeting trend. Fintechxe2x80x99s momentum has been gradually building in recent years and was accelerated (in a big way) by the COVID-19 pandemic. HW Media CEO and FinLedger founder Clayton Collins is a former banker who had a vision for a B2B-focused fintech publication for about a year before making it a reality this past August. As managing editor, my vision is to build a publication that is covering all the big news in B2B fintech while uncovering the less obvious happenings in the space that are also super important. We are interested in covering what the incumbents are doing and how they are partnering with, competing with, investing in, and acquiring startups as well as how those startups are raising money and working to partner with, compete and in some cases, get acquired by the incumbents. I have been a business journalist for most of my 26-year career, and what I find most interesting about companies and technologies they develop is the people behind them. Thatxe2x80x99s why I guess it should be no surprise that our stories that are very people-centric tend to perform especially well. Cool companies and technologies are fun to read about but sometimes whatxe2x80x99s even more interesting is hearing the stories of the people who created them. What led to them doing so. What problem(s) they were trying to solve. How they grew their company. As for the audience, we want to reach the financial services and fintech professional xe2x80x93 serving and engaging with readers at big banks, insurance companies and challengers and startups trying to change the game. We believe all will have an interest in the content we create (and aggregate in our daily newsletter). Our main focus is on the banking, payments, proptech and insurtech spaces. But wexe2x80x99re also looking at tangential sectors such as cybersecurity, big data and regtech so wexe2x80x99re spanning a broad range of industries in our coverage.Sar :What do you believe are less obvious stories in B2B fintech? Mary : I think cross-border payments is a very important and growing segment within B2B fintech. I recently covered the $31 million funding round of a startup called Veem, which is building what it describes as a global payments network for businesses. Interestingly, Truist Ventures (the corporate venture arm of Truist Financial) led the round as its first ever investment. The companyxe2x80x99s goal is to solve a pain point for businesses by making it much simpler to send money to companies (such as suppliers) or pay employees in other countries.Along those same lines, FinLedger is interested in some of the less obvious sectors within fintech such as proptech, construction tech (which I personally think has massive opportunity) and insurtech. Insurance in particular is being disrupted by a number of startups from the more well-known companies such as Lemonade and Root to the lesser known players such as The Zebra and Branch. During the pandemic, things have intensified as more people have to file and process claims remotely so the incumbents are having to adapt.As a former real estate reporter, I understand the complexities of the construction industry in a way that others may not. Itxe2x80x99s a massive industry that has historically been very slow to adopt technology and is not necessarily viewed as xe2x80x98sexyxe2x80x99 or easy to understand by a lot of investors. Itxe2x80x99s known for inefficiency, which leads to both (major) time and money lost. I think as the people leading construction companies are increasingly from newer generations, they are more open to adopting technology. As such, startups targeted at helping companies in this industry, such as a fintech called Briq for example, have a ton of opportunity.Sar. :  It is easy to lose sight of the fact that news outlets are organizations just like companies they cover and they face a similar set of challenges that come from a group of people working together. Since FinLedger is so young and new, it is basically like a seed-stage startup. What can you tell us about how you are thinking about building the newsroom?Mary : Itxe2x80x99s funny you say that since Ixe2x80x99ve been thinking the exact same thing. Ixe2x80x99ve been covering startups for years, but now I am in the position of building one. From the beginning, I believed our strategy should be to come out the gate by contracting with experienced, seasoned journalists who could cover the space knowledgeably and without much direction. Along those lines, we have contracted with four stellar writers (Suman Bhattacharyya, Ellen Chang, John Egan and John Hyatt) who cover a combination of breaking news and features. With this strategy, wexe2x80x99ve been able to produce some great content in our first two months of publishing and build early credibility. I am also continuing to write some xe2x80x93 focusing mostly on breaking news, some funding coverage and in-depth Q&As with industry leaders such as this interview I did with Amit Jhawar, ex-Venmo GM and current Accel investor. We are in the process of hiring for a more junior, assignment reporter role. Ideally, this person will come in with a hunger to learn and report on the fintech industry. This is just the beginning as we continue to grow.Sar : How do the contracting relationships work? Mary : I essentially identified three writers who Ixe2x80x99ve known over the years and had experience covering finance. They are all top notch journalists who donxe2x80x99t need much direction. Our fourth writer I actually discovered on Twitter. Hexe2x80x99s working on his Masterxe2x80x99s but I was really impressed by a newsletter that he writes so initiated a conversation with him, and hexe2x80x99s written some awesome articles so far.Ixe2x80x99m at the point now, though, that I need help on a daily basis xe2x80x93 for example with writing and producing our daily newsletter. It takes up most of my mornings, which keeps me from doing other things like writing more stories, editing or building relationships :) I also would love to have someone on staff I could assign more breaking news to, who at the same time will work on weekly features. As we grow, wexe2x80x99ll continue to hire more staff writers and editors.Sar :As someone who has been a freelance journalist for a considerable portion of your career, how do you feel about the idea of high profile journalists going independent and the chatter around creator or passion economy in journalism? Mary :  I mean, all the power to them! I think that any journalist (like Casey Newton) who has built their brand to a point they feel comfortable and confident in going that route should absolutely go for it. Itxe2x80x99s not for everyone though.Sar : You wrote on a wide range of topics when you were at Crunchbase News. What can you tell us about if and how collecting information, finding sources and picking stories has changed your vertical focus on fintech? Mary : Yes, I covered every industry in the sun during my time at Crunchbase News and that was fun and a learning experience. But itxe2x80x99s really nice to be able to narrow my focus on a specific industry. While fintech is still broad, Ixe2x80x99m at least able to hone in on the space and not be spread as thin from a coverage perspective. The good news is that my three years at Crunchbase News was extremely valuable in terms of building a network. That has served me very well in my current role. People I previously worked with have kept up with my move and so I have been able to actually ease into this role more smoothly than even I expected! Having said that, therexe2x80x99s still a ton of work that needs to be done around awareness. SO many people donxe2x80x99t yet know that FinLedger exists. I do spend a good amount of time on Twitter, which is valuable not only in increasing exposure to our work but also in collecting information, finding sources and picking stories. I have made an effort to seek out xe2x80x9cexpertsxe2x80x9d in the space or at least people who are doing cool and innovative work in fintech. I like talking to a wide range of people, from investors to founders to analysts to big company executives. I believe itxe2x80x99s important to get a broad perspective.Sar : Fintech has been on a tear this year. Before the pandemic kicked in for most of us, in January and February, fintech was on fire with blockbuster M&A news of Plaid, CreditKarma and Galileo. Later, over the next couple months, late-stage fintech funding rounds of Stripe, Robinhood, Chime, IPOs of Bill.com and nCino, layoffs at the likes of Brex, Acorns et al and acquisitions of Kabbage & OnDeck were dominating the conversation. And, now, the chatter is dominated by how hot early-stage fintech deals are and the idea of embedded fintech is getting a lot more oxygen. Whatxe2x80x99s most interesting to you as an editor about all of this? What are we not talking about enough? Whatxe2x80x99s underreported?Mary : Ixe2x80x99m intrigued by the uptick in IPOs and SPACs in space. Wexe2x80x99ve seen a number in recent weeks alone (Billtrust, Affirm, and Root are just a few examples). Ixe2x80x99m also impressed by some of the large funding rounds and acquisitions that have taken place xe2x80x93 all of which in some ways validate the xe2x80x9chotnessxe2x80x9d of the space. No doubt embedded fintech and the xe2x80x98Buy Now Pay Laterxe2x80x99 movements are growing. Early-stage startups are raising money too. For example, I recently covered the $20 million Series A raise of Argyle, which aims to be the xe2x80x9cPlaid for employment records.xe2x80x9d Bain Capital Ventures led that round.I remain skeptical, though, because as wexe2x80x99ve seen in a number of situations lately xe2x80x93 raising gobs of money doesnxe2x80x99t always equal success and lots of companies going public are nowhere near being profitable.I think wexe2x80x99re not talking enough about how fintech can really help make the world more inclusive. And disappointingly, articles wexe2x80x99ve published on the topic havenxe2x80x99t performed as well as I would have liked. At the end of the day, all this technology is great but if itxe2x80x99s not helping people everywhere of all demographics lead better lives, then just how important or good is it? That might sound idealistic but I think itxe2x80x99s crucial to consider how everyone is impacted by advances in financial technology. I wrote an article recently (more of an opinion piece) about how we are seeing more online banks being founded by the Black and Latinx community to serve their communities. This says to me these communities donxe2x80x99t feel their needs are being met by existing institutions.Also, I find companies that are working to help the underbanked and unbanked become banked pretty interesting too. Galileo, for example, is doing a lot of work in Latin America to help fintechs more easily serve people in the region. Case in point lies in one of its clients, Klar, which at one point described itself as the xe2x80x9cChime of Mexicoxe2x80x9d and just raised $15 million.I feel like we in the industry have become desensitized when talking about millions of dollars being raised at billion dollar valuations. The majority of the world canxe2x80x99t begin to fathom such insane dollar amounts. So when companies are doing things to really help even out the playing field and not just help the rich get richer, my ears perk up.Sar : You are based in Austin. What can you tell us about the Austin tech scene? The Information did an interesting trend piece on Austin recently. What should we be reading to keep up with the developments there? Mary : Austin has been an emerging tech hub for years now and that has really picked up in the past few years. Ixe2x80x99ve previously written a number of articles (for Crunchbase News and Forbes) about how and why Austinxe2x80x99s tech scene is growing so much. Companies are drawn to the laid-back lifestyle, lack of state income tax, a more business-friendly environment and a generally lower cost of living as compared to the Bay Area and New York.Therexe2x80x99s a ton of startups here, no doubt. And in particular, Austin is big in CPG, enterprise software and is increasingly home to a number of real estate/proptech-related startups. The city is culturally very similar to the Bay Area, very pretty and xe2x80x98hipxe2x80x99 and has a booming economy. More and more companies (big and small) are drawn to either relocating here, opening secondary offices here, or building large campuses here (Apple, Google, Oracle, Tesla). My friend, Brent Winstrom, a senior editor at AustinInno has done a great job of examining the trend from the startup perspective at least.Sar : Who are some people you learn the most from about the fintech landscape? What are some of your favorite sources of information?Mary : Twitter is a great source of information and so is LinkedIn. Every day, FinLedger sends out a newsletter in which we share not only our own content but links to other outlets publishing articles that are relevant to the industry. In choosing this content, I read a wide range of publications from the more mainstream Wall Street Journal to Bloomberg to the more niche Pymnts.com and Banking Dive.I learn a lot from every single person I interview, to be honest. Thatxe2x80x99s one of the most fun things about my job. Itxe2x80x99s a constant education. But in terms of people who just generally know a lot about the industry whose musings I like to keep up with? They include Fintech Todayxe2x80x99s Ian Kar, Nik Milanovic, and Spiros Margaris. And of course journalists such as my former colleagues Alex Wilhelm, Christine Hall and Natasha Mascarenhas.Previous interviews : Katie Perry, VP of Marketing at PublicJulia DeWahl, ex Chief of Staff at OpendoorJill Carlson, Principal at Slow VenturesBiz Carson, Reporter at ProtocolJack Altman, Cofounder & CEO of LatticeNatasha Mascarenhas, Reporter at TechCrunchFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"A chat with Mary Ann Azevedo, Managing Editor of FinLedger\n - SarHaribhakti's Newsletter","url":"https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/mary-ann-azevedo-managing-editor"}

Both of us moved to SF on a similar timeline. We became twitter friends and finally met in SF! I love reading your personal newsletter. Anyhow, I have always been very curious about how young journalists go about building sources when they get started. Can you tell us how you started building your network of sources in Silicon Valley?  Natasha : Ah! I feel like the best compliment a writer can get is that their writing made someone else feel something, anything. So thank you for saying that, it really means a lot to me. People make it seem like, in order to be successful, you need to be able to walk into a bar, schmooze your way into everyone baring their deepest darkest secrets, and tweet your way to virality. I really think it doesnxe2x80x99t have to be as calculated (or exhausting) as that. I think Mike Isaac got one of his biggest Uber scoops by sitting across from an employee at the bar and just listening. So, I think in journalism itxe2x80x99s less about calculating what it takes to build a very successful source network, and more about how do you learn more from more people as time goes on?Changing my perspective on that action-item has changed the game on how I grow the network of people I talk to for stories. I stopped viewing my empathy as a disadvantage, and started viewing it as a competitive advantage. Anyways, my empathy-driven way of building up sources is scheduling a call with no purpose or angle other than getting to know each other better (this is not a rule for embargos or one-hit news pieces). Before the call, I prepare by learning about the person and getting a comfortable conversation opener. During the call, I take rough notes and try to straddle the line between being vulnerable, and being professional. My goal by the end of the conversation is not ever to make my source treat me like a friend, but instead treat me like a human they feel comfortable talking to. It can be a time suck. Sometimes it doesnxe2x80x99t work. But the way this builds and gives me those returns is that at one point, I can start asking this source I have a colored perspective of about x, y, and z. In some cases, Ixe2x80x99ll get some answers, in other cases, the media-training will kick in and theyxe2x80x99ll pass, and in the best cases, theyxe2x80x99ll answer x, y, and z, and then point me to the real story that lies in the a, b, c (Ixe2x80x99m regretting this metaphor). I think sources beget other sources, and stories beget stories. Sar : Woah, I totally wasnxe2x80x99t expecting the direction you took with that question! I very much admire the mindset. You can tell how little I understand about how the sausage gets made in your world. My chat with Protocolxe2x80x99s Biz Carlson made that clearer to me last week. You covered Clearbanc in the context of debt financing options when I used to work there! Now, that idea of alternative funding models is in vogue and is manifesting in different ways. Companies like Pipe are going after it for different business models like SaaS. There are capital arms of various companies like Toast, Stripe, Square, and Shopify. You have written about some of that as well. I'm sure you know twitter is all in on fintech memes. As a journalist who has some association with fintech stories, what can you tell us about common themes in fintech pitches you might be getting? What are some ideas or questions that are not fully hashed out enough for you to do a story but you often think about when you are staring at fintech domination in your inbox? Natasha : If I had 20% more time in my week, I would cover fintech more rigorously because I think itxe2x80x99s a fascinating sector in technology right now (hot! takes! only!). The idea that I think about a lot is how fintech is empowering the next generation of small-medium businesses, from the QR code wexe2x80x99ll find on tables to no such thing as cash-only establishments. I think a lot about Toast. The company made deep cuts in the beginning of the pandemic, but, going forward, it seems like  it owns the key technology that the next generation of restaurants will need to adopt in order to be successful. So I think thatxe2x80x99s the crux of the next story we need to write about fintech: how will SMB services serve a forever changed business environment in post-covid dynamics. While Stripe and Shopify are obvious winners right now, Ixe2x80x99m very excited to see what new entrants empower mom and pop shops going forward. Sar : As you know, I have been working at the intersection of SMBs and technology for quite some time now. I would recommend GGV Capitalxe2x80x99s piece and the Protocolxe2x80x99s Small Business Recovery series!I have noticed you have significantly ramped up your coverage of edtech over the summer at TechCrunch. It is one of those areas where the pandemic has accelerated growth. You have written about everything from covering companies like CourseHero, Zoom for Class, BookClub to marco commentary on adoption, funding and learning pods & associated inequities. Looking back on the past 3-4 months, what are the biggest unclear questions in your mind based on everything you are seeing in edtech? What has surprised you the most? Natasha : Itxe2x80x99s crazy. My first day covering edtech was the day that Stanford closed classes. A one-off story became my informal beat here at TC, and Ixe2x80x99m about to start a series on Extra Crunch looking at the future of different dynamics within education (so stay tuned)The biggest unclear questions:The growth of tutoring businesses is bringing, along with it, a spur of gig economy workers. We all know how gig economy workers have been exploited in other high-growth industries such as food delivery or ride-sharing, and so Ixe2x80x99m curious how edtech plans to grow sustainably. How does the world of gig workers function in edtech and is it vulnerable to the same abuse in other industries? I see a second digital divide coming. Before, it was between students who owned a laptop versus students who didnxe2x80x99t own a laptop. Now that more students have access to computers, therexe2x80x99s a new divide: who can afford to pay for supplemental services and who canxe2x80x99t? As teachers leave schools, this will become an even bigger dynamic.Tests are going to go through a major upheaval. The biggest surprises:When I first started covering edtech, I made a list of the most interesting companies in the sector that raised money within the last year. Most of those companies raised during the pandemic, which eventually just felt like a game I was playing with myself. I wouldnxe2x80x99t count this as a subtle flex, but more so as an example of how many edtech companies really raised new money during this time. The consumer habits in the United States continue to surprise me; families in China and India are more willing to spend for educational and supplemental services which is good news for edtech companies based there. While COVID-19 has forced American families to spend money, itxe2x80x99s still nowhere near China and India totals.Re-skilling is an insanely huge industry that I snoozed before. Itxe2x80x99s worth diving into. Sar : I mostly agree with what you said. Connie Chen & Anne Lee Skates at a16z recently published a well researched edtech landscape piece. Herexe2x80x99s what they said with respect to the variance in spend across countries as you pointed out : xe2x80x9cSurprisingly, the amount of money spent on digital education in the U.S. still makes up a minuscule sliver of most state and school budgets, which are shrinking and famously tangled in bureaucracy. By comparison, wexe2x80x99re running behind countries like India and China. In China, online education is a $50+ billion industry, according to Deloitte, and is projected to more than triple in the next three years. Meanwhile, in the U.S. COVID has brought renewed urgency to the mission to make our education system more digital and accessible. For many teachers and parents, the status quoxe2x80x94Zoomed-out kids passively watching teacher lecturesxe2x80x94is sorely lacking.xe2x80x9dI want to now zoom out and talk about Twitter and Journalism. Besides memes, a big part of being active on Twitter is discovering new people. We met on twitter! As a young journalist, what role do you think Twitter plays in your career? Do you think of Twitter as just a personal outlet that happens to help you with work every now and then or are you intentionally using it to find new stories, discover startups, etc? Natasha : Twitter is a net positive in my life. When I was looking for a new opportunity while at Crunchbase News, I remember I DMxe2x80x99d the editor-in-chief of TechCrunch, Matthew Panzarino, over Twitter to catch up over coffee. He was in preparation mode for Disrupt Berlin, but a month later, he reached out asking if I was open to chatting. As you can see, it worked out in my favor and Ixe2x80x99m nearly 8 months into my job with TechCrunch! I think thatxe2x80x99s a fairly common story among those of us in tech, but itxe2x80x99s not lost on me how special it is that our world works that way. My other favorite part of Twitter is that it lets me learn about people I wouldnxe2x80x99t otherwise meet. For example, you were one of my first Twitter friends! I met Freia Lobo and Kate Clark the same way. All of a sudden, the niche ecosystem I had moved across the country to work in did not feel so small. I started recognizing faces on Market Street and running into Twitter friends at dinners, and it was a refreshing dynamic. Another wacky, magical thing about Twitter that Ixe2x80x99ll never take for granted. The biggest problem with Twitter is that it twists tensions without context. And the job of a journalist is to explore different tensions that exist within the world and give them appropriate context. As a reporter in the beginning of my career, I constantly have to remind myself that Twitter isnxe2x80x99t tech. And tech isnxe2x80x99t Twitter. Panzer always tells us at TC to look critically at who we follow on Twitter; a diverse timeline is a diversity of thought, and I think that sometimes it ends up just being journalists talking to journalists, VCs talking to VCs, and founders talking to founders. Sar : You are very engaged in tech twitter zeitgeist. Do you notice any changes in the conversations we are having and who is more visible on twitter these days? What would you like to see more or less of? Letxe2x80x99s avoid venturing into the tech vs media battle for now!Natasha : The racial reckoning that happened this summer was a much-too-late awakening for the world, and the tech community. I think a lot of disturbing realizations were continuing to be had among the white supremacy that exists within venture capital and startups. I think those conversations should continue to exist.I want the conversation and statements of support to move past Twitter, and into action, to lift and amplify Black entrepreneurs and investors. And of course, Ixe2x80x99ll plug Megan Rose Dickeyxe2x80x99s Human Capital, which is TCxe2x80x99s weekly newsletter for people who want to consistently educate themselves on topics about labor, diversity, and inclusion.Beyond that, I think a lot about how Twitter has become the public square for all of us during this time. All of a sudden, we couldnxe2x80x99t run into friends at Blue Bottle or on the street or for happy hour. Twitter became the only place to really discuss and trade notes and talk; so it became even bigger in my daily routine. In its best moments, itxe2x80x99s a place where I can go to react and feel understood. In its lowest moments, it feels overwhelming to have the one place where you xe2x80x9crun intoxe2x80x9d other people be filled with vitriol and hatred. All I can say is to limit your screen time, follow Karen Ho, and remember that a social media platform is not real life.Sar : Alright, so tech vs media! I think most of the battle is basically a bunch of very online extremists on both sides fighting each other on Twitter scoring points for their tribes and the majority of people are just rolling eyes scrolling through their feeds. What are your thoughts on this never ending and often insufferable conversation? My generous read of the situation is it is often a clash of default optimism and default skepticism of the two sides. A lot of times, when you really see the specifics of the situation, it is a personal beefs masquerading as tech vs media. Natasha : I think the real impact of the tech versus media xe2x80x9csituationxe2x80x9d is that stories that need to be told will not be told because of fear-mongering and a lack of education on how journalism works. In the beginning of the pandemic, Zoom let us sneak into each otherxe2x80x99s homes, see the frizzy truths of colleagues and sources, and at some points, made us skip the xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m finexe2x80x9d small talk and go for the jugular of whatxe2x80x99s hurting us. Then, something changedI have seen vulnerability disappear from many, many founders I speak to. Remember the job of a journalist I mentioned above? To find tension and give context. While I still speak to some fantastic founders every single day, I have noticed media-training to a fault in more and more of the people I talk to. I donxe2x80x99t want to interview a walking, talking point. I want to interview someone who is candid. And part of me chalks up the new stoicism among a number of founders to a part of the tech versus media Twitter debate getting internalized by the next generation of founders. But let me be clear, journalists are not victims of this dynamic. It all means that we need to work harder to be open about our processes and the way we work. No xe2x80x9cgotcha journalism.xe2x80x9d Make corrections when necessary. Think about context. Give grace to people who do not know how off the record works. Ixe2x80x99m not going anywhere. Media isnxe2x80x99t going anywhere. We just need to react with empathy, and clarity. Sar : Thatxe2x80x99s a very reasonable take!You record a weekly podcast with your TechCrunch colleagues Alex and Danny. I am a fan. You guys make it both entertaining and informative. Do you find that there are some stories that are better suited for one medium or the other? Do you think tech journalism overall could explore doing audio-only stories for some topics? Audio adds a kind of color and tone that written word just cannot. I often feel the tech vs media battle could calm down a bit if we start humanizing people on both sides more. There are real people in the dunk tweets and uncomfortable stories! I always wonder about this when I see a journalist I follow do a live stream or a talk show on Clubhouse or goes on a podcast.Natasha : Thank you!! I look forward to recording Equity each week because it gives me time to trade notes with colleagues I admire and crack a few jokes while doing so. Ixe2x80x99d love to see more audio in tech journalism! I think itxe2x80x99s a good way to bring xe2x80x9creporterxe2x80x99s notebookxe2x80x9d thinking to more people, and add a level of voice that doesnxe2x80x99t come off in stories. Imagine, a world in which tech could welcome and actually understand sarcasm! I definitely would love to see tech journalism include more audio. And therexe2x80x99s a ton of rabbit holes we could go down here. For example, see this smashing piece by Casey Newton for where the world of audio journalism could be heading within tech. Therexe2x80x99s also the services  that share a news story in audio-form, and of course, podcasts. These all excite me, both from an accessibility perspective and, to your point, a color and tone perspective. But, just like every form of content, audio requires a level of trust from the end-user. Equity listeners give us some of their mindspace, in this year nonetheless, twice a week. It canxe2x80x99t be taken lightly, and I feel like we need to consistently be innovating to make sure wexe2x80x99re not wasting anyonexe2x80x99s time. I think we do a great job, and I think we need to keep doing a great job. Now, Ixe2x80x99d love to say that audio, and Equity, was fixing the tech versus media battle. But, unfortunately, I donxe2x80x99t think wexe2x80x99re at that stage yet (spoiler alert, not everyone is good at taking  jokes). Sar : I'm sure you and most of my readers have heard of this idea of passion economy (my friend and prolific writer Li Jin coined that term when she was at a16z last year). A subset of that theme is journalists going independent. NYTxe2x80x99s Marc Tracy and Axiosxe2x80x99s Sara Fischer did trend pieces on it in the wake of Casey Newton leaving Verge. Alex Kantrowitz & Anne Helen Petersen leaving Buzzfeed created a similar splash. There are many angles to explore here : what's hype vs whats real, newfound empathy for being a founder, relative cost-benefit analysis of being at a media company vs going solo, original content vs curation and commentary, etc. There are lots of hot, lukewarm and cold takes out there on each of these topics. I wouldn't want us to regurgitate and relitigate them here. What I do want to riff on is the access and diversity angle here. There are many ways of thinking about it : 1) The role backgrounds, personality types and org cultures play in enabling journalists to build followings and personal brands on social media which later enables them to have the option to go solo. Will we see the Washington Post produce independent journalists, for example? It is well known for having stricter policies against social media usage. 2) Second angle to the diversity theme is it is just amazing to see the variety of content. There is something for everyone! But I do wonder if the conflation of writing well behind a paywall and reporting spreads more broadly! Journalism is a profession to be masterted just like any other! 3) The third angle is the shortage of practitioners in media of areas that are being written about. Will we see a wave of tech journalists going solo partnering up with people with the experience working at tech companies to give a better look at making sense of what's going on? There are obvious counter arguments here but this goes back to each side understanding the other better. Thoughts? Natasha : This could be its own interview by itself, if you ask me. I discuss this a little in a post I just whipped up with the Equity crew a few days ago, but I think the future of media and journalism is complicated. There are a lot of good things that get me excited such as the opportunity for journalists to make more money, the opportunity for niche subjects to get the coverage they deserve (The Juggernaut, for one), and the opportunity for more people to write in general. But, therexe2x80x99s a lot of realistic, not sexy aspects, that bum me about the xe2x80x9ctrend of journalists going independent.xe2x80x9d Leaving a stable job to start a paid newsletter, for example, requires a level of wealth, platform, and audience. Often, that level of wealth, platform, and audience is only afforded to white dudes. The passion economy conversation often celebrates the wins, as it should, but ignores the inherent risk of going solo. Risk isnxe2x80x99t born equally. In fact, itxe2x80x99s a biased beast that disproportionately impacts black and brown people. The reality is that outlets like the New York Times are still the dream for a lot of journalists. There are benefits when you work within a community, right down to being new and eavesdropping on the journalist youxe2x80x99ve admired for so long as they handle an upset source. Ixe2x80x99ve truly learned so much that way -- My first big job in journalism was the Boston Globe and I got to sit next to Michael Rezendes, from the Spotlight team, every day. I wouldnxe2x80x99t trade that for anything. You learn a lot as a fly on the wall, and as I answer all these questions, Ixe2x80x99m realizing that I should probably buy a shirt with this phrase or something because I canxe2x80x99t stop using it. I worry that the glamorizing of going independent is being applied to all journalists, when in reality, only a handful of journalists within tech are trying it out. For the few that have, I will cheer them on with open arms and (when affordable) open wallets. But for the far other ones, you arenxe2x80x99t being boring.Sar : Ixe2x80x99m just going to leave this here :Why do we not see journalists talk about stories they could have written but didnxe2x80x99t? Is there a journalistic code against this? Natasha : This has happened to every journalist, millions of times, and usually it just ends up being a retweet and a salty, fake-jealous, slack message to your work friend. Therexe2x80x99s no journalistic code against tweeting it openly that I know of, but I usually stick to being a good sport and giving the reporter kudos. I think itxe2x80x99s a little self indulgent to say that you had an idea while therexe2x80x99s some out there who executed on that same idea before you did. Speaking of codes though, I think one of the biggest journalistic codes which certain publications donxe2x80x99t follow (and we all know who those are), is linking stories from other outlets if you get the information from them. Link! Link! Link! I worked at a small media startup, and I saw first-hand how much of a difference it makes in both confidence and traffic to be properly cited for your work. Sar : I'm a big believer in supporting the good work of people who donxe2x80x99t have high profiles. Too often the twitter zeitgeist gets obsessed with certain things because of the popularity of people behind those things.  Who are the 5-10 under-the-radar journalists we should check out and support? Natasha : Mary Ann AzevedoDaniel Funke Rowan WalrathImaan SheikhJustin Phillips Trisha ThadaniPrevious interviews : Katie Perry, VP of Marketing at PublicJulia DeWahl, ex Chief of Staff at OpendoorJill Carlson, Principal at Slow VenturesBiz Carson, Reporter at ProtocolJack Altman, Cofounder & CEO of LatticeFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"A chat with Natasha Mascarenhas, Reporter at TechCrunch - SarHaribhakti's Newsletter","url":"https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-natasha-mascarenhas-reporter"}

If you could tell the 2016 version of yourself an important lesson to accelerate progress and avoid pitfalls, what would it be?Jack : Itxe2x80x99s really easy to lie to yourself about having product market fit when you donxe2x80x99t. In our first year, we were building a product that got some lukewarm interest, but we were very clearly pushing a boulder uphill rather than shepherding one as it rolled downhill. I sort of allowed myself to get tricked by supportive friends who could maybe convince their teams to give it a spin, but they had to fight to convince people and even when they did the retention wasnxe2x80x99t very good.A year into Lattice we pivoted away from OKRs and towards performance reviews. I donxe2x80x99t surf, but the difference was what I imagine youxe2x80x99d feel between a tiny little swell and a serious wave. You know when youxe2x80x99re on the real thing and you wouldnxe2x80x99t really be able to get off it if you tried, so you just paddle and stand up and try to hold on.Starting a company is scary for many people (it certainly was for me), and so youxe2x80x99re primed to listen to the market with xe2x80x9chappy earsxe2x80x9d, looking to spin every piece of data you get as positively as possible.My advice to myself in year one of Lattice is to be extremely skeptical of whether or not you have product market fit, and assume you donxe2x80x99t until the evidence that you do is abundant and overwhelming. And until youxe2x80x99re there, iterate quickly and aggressively and be maniacally single-minded about finding it.Sar : I love that description! I'm not a founder but have been involved with multiple product launches and projects in my short career so far and I can relate with the dynamic of deluding ourselves into thinking therexe2x80x99s product-market fit with the desire to listen to xe2x80x9chappy earsxe2x80x9d and positively spinning the little data we might have. It is a really unnatural to be skeptical of signals you are desperately wishing to see right before you ship something!We use Lattice at work. We recently completed a performance review cycle using Lattice. That experience got me thinking about a few product ideas for your team. I reached out to you and you were very open to riff on ideas. I very much appreciate that.People are messy. Interpersonal relationships are messier. Building software for people management feels much harder than most other categories where the outcomes are much more definable and quantifiable. How do you think about what the company should care about tactically to define the scope of what you should build? What I'm really wondering is how do you abstract human behaviors and relationships at the workplace into software interfaces to encourage desirable outcomes.Jack : Itxe2x80x99s a great question. One of the great things about our market is there are so many potential product expansions at all times; there are a lot of things you could imagine Lattice launching tomorrow and youxe2x80x99d think, xe2x80x9cyeah, that makes sense.xe2x80x9d Obviously this is also a potential pitfall, since we could easily go down unfruitful or distracting paths.Wexe2x80x99ve done what we considered major product expansions twice so far. After building the performance suite in 2016, we built engagement and pulse surveys in 2018, and then our new product, Grow, in 2020, which is infrastructure to manage employee career growth.Herexe2x80x99s approximately how I think about what might be in scope for Lattice to build, starting at the highest level with strategy:First, our mission is to make work meaningful, and we believe that meaning at work comes through community, purpose, and growth. So it has to fit into that.Second, I believe that we should seek to ride the broad trend that Lattice has been riding its whole life, which is the transition in the balance of power from companies to employees. The world has changed such that employees are more in the driver seat than ever before, and to remain competitive for talent, companies need to build their people practices to serve the employee. So all our products must put the employeexe2x80x99s experience at the center.Finally, wexe2x80x99re a venture-backed company with big ambitions, so everything we do also has to address a big enough market. The simple heuristic I ask myself here to see if I think a new product makes sense is xe2x80x9ccan I imagine this being a line item at nearly every company in five years?xe2x80x9dWhen considering new product expansions, I first test it against these questions. Assuming it passes, we then look at a few more follow ups. Do we have a special advantage building this product, either because of the way it interacts with the rest of our products, because of the nature of our customer relationships, or because of some special knowledge we might have? How difficult and expensive is this product to build relative to everything else we could work on? How well does this product line up with todayxe2x80x99s ideal customer profile, as well as the ICP wexe2x80x99re aiming for down the line?So you sort of run each new product consideration through these interrogations, and be somewhat systematic about it, but at least in my experience, at the end of it all you never have perfect information and you need to have some conviction in your intuition.Sar : I find that prioritization framework insightful. Ixe2x80x99m glad you brought up the notion of special advantage in terms of ecosystem. That brings us to my next question!We have talked about how a lot of products in this category are not great standalone businesses. Selling a package of products to People teams feels like the right way to go about building people management software to drive performance at companies. Therexe2x80x99s a never ending debate of specialist versus bundles in enterprise software. ADP, Workday and SAP collectively have market cap of nearly $300 billion! Can you give us a high level overview of how you think about the modern landscape of companies operating in this area and where you believe Lattice fits in it? Jack : I think this is one of the most fundamental dynamics in HR software, and probably in lots of other software markets as well. On one hand, bundling has huge value to customers, since it tends to make systems more integrated, easier to roll out across to employees, and cheaper. On the other hand, engineering resources are limited and building a broad suite necessarily trades off against quality, at least on some level.You can think of HR software in three basic universes; the nuts of bolts of employment, the acquisition of talent, and the management of talent.The nuts and bolts of employment are things like HRIS, payroll, benefits, time and attendance, etc., and here you tend to see the most successful companies being ones who consolidate. This is companies like Gusto, Rippling, or Paychex at the smaller end, and ADP or Workday at the larger end. Consolidation here makes a lot of sense for consumers, itxe2x80x99s just hard because each product is enormous. As a result, to compete here you need big teams and lots of capital.The acquisition of talent is things like applicant tracking, sourcing, background checks, and candidate experience. Here we see much less consolidation, and instead see more of a hub and spoke model where applicant tracking systems like Lever or Greenhouse live at the center with a broad ecosystem of integrations. I think this is partially due to the face that there are just so many different solutions recruiters are looking for.And then finally is Latticexe2x80x99s world, the management of talent. I think this part of the market is in the most flux; it was less than a decade ago that it became popular to call for xe2x80x9cthe end of performance reviewsxe2x80x9d, which led to a complete shake up in best practices around feedback and performance conversations and goal setting. And in that same period of time engagement surveys went from a cool niche tool to an expectation from HR leaders and employees.So things are still moving here. But broadly, I think the future looks more consolidated rather than less. I think companies in our space that can do more for the employees as their customers will win, and being able to connect disparate moments in the employee journey -- whether thatxe2x80x99s a promotion, a tough conversation, an unhappy quarter, an ambitious goal -- will be very valuable. Whether that proves to be right or not is to be determined, but wexe2x80x99ve certainly been building the company against that view of the world.Sar : I believe your team was predominantly in SF all these years when it was safe to assume that most of your existing and new customers have employees that are predominantly co-located in offices. Has the pandemic shifted the internal thinking on those assumptions and how you go about building products? If so, in what ways? Have you become hypersensitive to behavioral changes you now notice in the covid era to come up with product ideas?Jack : Thatxe2x80x99s right; before the pandemic basically all of our customers were co-located, and now basically none of them is (Lattice included). Wexe2x80x99ve felt some benefit from our customers doing remote work, since software now stands in for a lot of in person interactions, although itxe2x80x99s been offset by the negative impact to the economy.In terms of making product decisions based on the xe2x80x9cnew normalxe2x80x9d, wexe2x80x99re trying to operate the same way as before for two reasons.One, wexe2x80x99re not really in the business of predicting the future of remote work. It seems clear to me that a lot of people are realizing they like remote work, a lot of people couldnxe2x80x99t be more excited to get back to the office, and a lot of people arenxe2x80x99t sure what theyxe2x80x99re going to want to do when coworking is safe again. If we were in a business that was massively impacted by remote work, we might be forced to take a stronger view on remote work despite not feeling very sure about it. But since things are mostly steady, we can xe2x80x9cplace our betsxe2x80x9d on other dimensions that we have more special knowledge and conviction in.The second reason is that I fundamentally think, as far as our mission at Lattice goes, therexe2x80x99s not a whole lot wexe2x80x99d change even if we believed remote work was for sure the future. Wexe2x80x99re trying to build for the xe2x80x9cvegetablesxe2x80x9d of meaningful work -- purpose, career growth, a sense of belonging -- as opposed to things I think of more like xe2x80x9ccandyxe2x80x9d. So Ixe2x80x99m just not that sure what wexe2x80x99d do differently even if we did want to bet on a long term future where most people work remotely.Sar : When I was drafting these questions, I had assumed your answer to this question would be more or less xe2x80x9cof course it has impacted our thinking on what to build and how to buildxe2x80x9d. After reading your answer, I am surprised that I thought so! I very much appreciate your humility on how we simply do not know how all of this will shake out and your clarity on how what you are building for fundamentally remains unchanged. You guys have clearly invested a ton in producing superb highly quality content. I have really enjoyed it from time to time and I often send your interview with Stripe COO Claire Hughes Johnson to people. It is the kind of content that makes you want to buy the product. Is it all just content marketing or do you have a more layered vision for it? Everything from the substance of it to how you present it on your website is very impressive.Jack : That interview with Claire was one of my favorites, I learned a ton from it!It might just all be content marketing, but thatxe2x80x99s not the goal and certainly not how I think about it. Ixe2x80x99d say our goal, which we will probably always fall short of but will always strive for, is to build a media company inside of Lattice. The content should be so good and informative that itxe2x80x99s something wexe2x80x99d be proud of if it were a standalone project without the software company it sits on top of. It should be something that helps our customers run better companies, just like our products do.Fundamentally doing marketing with this mentality requires a certain leap of faith, and who knows whether it pays off; itxe2x80x99s time and money intensive, and like everything else it comes as an opportunity cost of peoplexe2x80x99s time.Compared to most SaaS companies, our marketing efforts are much more focused on the brand end than the data driven end. Obviously, in our view, this ultimately leads to better demand gen and a healthier overall business. I believe this investment has paid off, but I suppose wexe2x80x99ll never really know for sure.Sar : A recurring hot topic on tech twitter is the role of product managers at startups and when is it appropriate to hire your first PM and have a PM led product culture. What is your take on this?Jack : I think it really depends on your product and market, but by and large I think PMs are overused and over-relied on.As a disclaimer, at Lattice, PMs play a very important role and are equally important legs of the overall stool alongside design and engineering. But that, in my view, is a function of our strategy and the nature of our product. Wexe2x80x99ve got a high velocity EPD org that builds a lot of features across a lot of products for a lot of customer types, and as a result the exercise of prioritization and scoping is incredibly important. So in our context therexe2x80x99s enough work to go around to have distinct roles addressing the questions xe2x80x9cwhat should we build?xe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9chow should it work?xe2x80x9d, and xe2x80x9chow should we build it?xe2x80x9dBut I think a lot of companies have shown that you can get really powerful results by keeping the xe2x80x9cproduct workxe2x80x9d sitting with the engineers and designers. It keeps feedback loops shorter, pride of ownership higher, and leads to fewer things getting lost in translation and they move between the brains of different people.The early versions of Lattice were built by product-minded engineers and product-minded designers. They were certainly doing product management, but they didnxe2x80x99t have the title. I think almost all companies start this way, and just some choose to scale it up.So my take on this debate isnxe2x80x99t a very hot one; itxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cit dependsxe2x80x9d. If youxe2x80x99re building a company with tons of features and prioritization, build a strong PM practice. If youxe2x80x99re building a company that is heavily based on engineering or design, you probably donxe2x80x99t want to exercise that muscle quite as much.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"A chat with Jack Altman, Cofounder & CEO of Lattice - SarHaribhakti's Newsletter","url":"https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-jack-altman-cofounder"}

I'll be quoting from both Scott and the a16z post by Martin Casado and Matt Bornstein.Taken together, these [cloud operation and compute] forces contribute to the 25% or more of revenue that AI companies often spend on cloud resources. In extreme cases, startups tackling particularly complex tasks have actually found manual data processing cheaper than executing a trained [ML] model. - a16zThe pricing structure of xe2x80x9ccloudxe2x80x9d bullshit is designed to extract maximum blood from people with heavy data or compute requirements. - ScottIs 25% of rev spent on just cloud operations [3] a lot? To contextualise that number, let's look at the total cost of goods (COGS) of Salesforce, a best-in-class software company. Their 8K shows a total COGS of 25%, which includes all other costs that Salesforce would classify in that category [4], not just cloud costs. In order to have the same margin as a Salesforce, AI companies would need to have no other COGS besides cloud costs.anecdotal data shows that many companies spend up to 10-15% of revenue on [manual data cleaning and data accuracy maintenance] process xe2x80x93 usually not counting core engineering resources xe2x80x93 and suggests ongoing development work exceeds typical bug fixes and feature additions - a16zTurns out AI companies do have other COGS, spending up to 15% on manual data processes. Mainstream media focuses on the predictions from machine learning, but data scientists spend more of their time on data collection and cleaning. That isn't going away, meaning most AI companies are immediately 15% less profitable than a software company. That's also before any other COGS involved, implying final gross margins are even lower.The allure of investing in software companies is that marginal costs are low, so a high percentage of incremental revenue is converted to profit. AI companies need to lower that COGS % or expect some benefit of scale in order to be as attractive. Is that likely?the computational power of GPU chips hasnxe2x80x99t exactly been growing apace - ScottAI requires graphics processing units (GPUs) to do the computing. However, the resources required have grown enormously compared to the growth in computing power; Moore's Law isn't applying on the AI compute side. We shouldn't expect that 25% COGS above to go down significantly any time soon.Since the range of possible input values is so large, each new customer deployment is likely to generate data that has never been seen before - a16zmost people havenxe2x80x99t figured out that ML oriented processes almost never scale like a simpler application would - ScottCompare selling Microsoft Office vs selling a consulting offering to a company. In the first case, you can give the same copy of Office that you've been selling to all other companies. In the second, you'll have to create new materials tailored for that client [5], which means you'll always incur incremental costs when getting more revenue.If AI is more like the second case, this means we shouldn't expect the other 15% (and any other COGS) to go down either. That low margin still takes a lot of work to get. Not only are AI companies less profitable, but we should expect that margin profile to last for a whileIs that increase in cost worth it? Neither a16z nor Scott seem to think so:In the AI world, technical differentiation is harder to achieve. [...] Data is the core of an AI system, but itxe2x80x99s often owned by customers, in the public domain, or over time becomes a commodity. - a16zI know that, from a business perspective, something dumb like Naive Bayes or a linear model might solve the customerxe2x80x99s problem just as well as the latest gigawatt neural net atrocity. [...] People wonxe2x80x99t pay a premium over in-house ad-hoc data science solutions unless it represents truly game changing results. - ScottIf a company's product isn't actually significantly better, they have to result to sales and marketing in order to differentiate. This implies even higher costs compared to a typical software company, which is already sales heavy. It does make you wonder whether the hype around machine learning is justified or is used to justify a company's survival.I'm uncertain what the threshold is for \"game changing\" though. One of my readers replied after the Vicki Boykis post that implied he considered 10-15% improvement in accuracy significant [6]. I suppose it'll depend on the company.If the product itself is a commodity, perhaps the total market is large?Many companies are finding that the minimum viable task for AI models is narrower than they expected. - a16zbut the hockey stick required for VC backing, and the army of Ph.D.s required to make it work doesnxe2x80x99t really mix well with those limited domains, which have a limited market. - ScottIt's commonly thought that you can just throw machine learning at any problem and it'll magically work for that problem and any other similar problems. Unfortunately, for now it seems like many problems won't yet be improved by flinging AI at it. We wanted Her, instead we got Tinder.If AI has limited use cases, the total addressable market to sell your AI product into is a lot smaller than what you thought it was. Given VCs consider size of market as a key factor for investment, this seems like it'll be a problem when AI companies need to demonstrate growth in the future.most AI systems today arenxe2x80x99t quite software, in the traditional sense. And AI businesses, as a result, donxe2x80x99t look exactly like software businesses. They involve ongoing human support and material variable costs. They often donxe2x80x99t scale quite as easily as wexe2x80x99d like. And strong defensibility xe2x80x93 critical to the xe2x80x9cbuild once / sell many timesxe2x80x9d software model xe2x80x93 doesnxe2x80x99t seem to come for free. - a16zservices companies are not valued like software businesses are. VCs love software businesses; work hard up front to solve a problem, print money forever. Thatxe2x80x99s why they get the 10-20x revenues valuations. Services companies? Why would you invest in a services company? Their growth is inherently constrained by labor costs and weird addressable market issues. - ScottBusinesses are often valued based on a multiple of some financial metric such as revenue, EBITDA, or net income. Software companies are usually valued at a higher multiple than services companies, due to the reasons mentioned above. Higher gross margins matter, as described by Two SigmaBoth a16z and Scott are implying that an AI company is more similar to a services company and hence should get a lower valuation multiple than a software company. Even if you think they'll get a higher multiple than the 2x revenue that services get, AI companies shouldn't be getting the 10x revenue that traditional software companies do, and that these AI companies previously raised money at.This will likely be a problem for AI companies that have raised at high valuations and are now finding it hard to raise their next round due to more people realising the above issues. I'd expect, with 60% certainty, that we'll start to see lower valuations than expected for late stage AI company private rounds.Warren Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger, has given money to an outsider to run only once in his life. That outsider is Li Lu of Himalaya Capital.Founded in 1998, Himalaya is a value investing firm, focused on companies in Asia with an emphasis on China. Typical of that investment style, they look to be long-term owners of quality companies that compound over time [7]. They've historically taken a 0% management fee, and 25% carry after a 6% return hurdle. This is unusual in the investment industry, and demonstrates how confident they are in generating annual returns [8].Since Li Lu is China focused, there are fewer interviews of him than other famous investors. Graham of Longriver recently translated a 9,000 word speech outlining Li Lu's investment philosophy, which I'll summarise below [9].Li Lu discussed four basic concepts of value investing, the difference between investing and speculating, circles of competence, investor temperament, and what the average person can do to grow wealth. I found that most of these can be bucketed under his four concepts, which are:Stocks represent part ownership of a businessThe market is a guide, and it's up to you to accept or reject itInvesting is about probability and a margin of safetyBuild a circle of competence and stick within itThe concept of buying a stock as buying ownership in the company is common among followers of Buffett's value investing style. Rather than viewing a stock as a number, Li Lu views it as a responsibility. This is in contrast to long/short hedge funds who trade more on sentiment and price catalysts, or quant funds that trade on who knows what [10].no longer were people trying to guess the future results of the East India Company; they were simply trying to guess the behaviour of other people buying and selling the stock.Li Lu discusses the history of the stock market, which was first created to let companies raise capital to fund their growth. It then took advantage of humanity's gambling nature, to become not just a bet on the future of the company, but a bet on what you think other people think of the future of the company. This is similar to the Keynesian beauty contest concept.This is the biggest difference between investing and speculating: in the end, the net result of all speculation is zero. Of course, there will be some people who win for a bit longer; and some [who are taken for suckers] without any chance to strike it rich. But with enough time, all speculation ends in a zero-sum result. Therefore, due to their focus on short term behaviour, speculators have absolutely no influence on economic growth or a companyxe2x80x99s profits.He makes a distinction between investing and speculating, putting people that forecast company performance in the former category as investors, and people that forecast how others react in the latter category as speculators. Investors care about company fundamentals and the long term, speculators care about sentiment and the short term. In his view, most of the investment funds out there now would be classified as speculators.I'd disagree with Li Lu on speculator influence, and do believe speculators can influence company behaviour, whether it be through activist investing or more regular investor conference meetings. We see companies make decisions all the time that were directly due to shareholder pressure, such as fire CEOs, divest businesses, or sell the company.This doesn't take away from his general point though, that speculating as he defines it is zero-sum. When you outperform on a company due to issues unrelated to fundamental company growth, someone else on the other side of that trade has underperformed. If you have better returns than the market, someone else is having a worse day.For the most part though, you can just ignore him. But when Mr. Market becomes extremely worked up xe2x80x93 either excited or depressed xe2x80x93 you can use him to buy and sell.He discusses the popular anecdote of Mr Market, which highlights how the stock market can be viewed as something that shouts a price at you continuously. It's up to you to make a decision on when to buy and sell, and you're better off ignoring the market price most of the time. You're not in a hurry; activity is the enemy.When you are at school and hear about value investing, you think it should be no big deal to put into practice. But as soon as you get to work, you realise that there are real people on the other side of every transaction. [...] they are superior to you in every way and donxe2x80x99t at all resemble Grahamxe2x80x99s Mr. Market. So after a while, after being continuously scolded by your boss, you will feel that Mr. Market and these people are all better than you. You will start to have doubts.Value investing is much harder to do in practice, since you do fewer trades. It's one thing to say you're a disciplined person; it's another to resist buying options in your robinhood account when you hear your friends made $10k in one day by lurking on r/wallstreetbets. When everyone around you is making money quickly, it's nearly impossible to stick with a less exciting strategy.This is easier to do when you adopt the owner's mentality mentioned above. If you bought stocks with the same attitude you did in buying a house, you'd be more diligent and level-headed about when you buy.The most important thing in investing is predicting the future but the future is inherently unpredictable. Investing is therefore about probability and a margin of safety.Investing being about probability is a concept most professionals would agree with, regardless of style. Even the best investors have a hit rate in the 50-60% range, meaning they are wrong a lot [11]. Rather than going in 100% on a single name, they think in terms of investing in a portfolio of names, sizing each position accordingly based on what they think the odds of success for each company is.The margin of safety concept is not as universal, and more typical of value investors. This is the idea that for every investment you make, you should do so at a price that still gives you enough buffer should there be unexpected declines. If you can find enough margin of safety in an investment, it's worth looking at. If you can't get enough margin of safety, you shouldn't invest.Li Lu tells a long story about how he got started in investing after hearing Buffett speak [12]. He started reading more of Buffett's writing, researching companies, and visiting them on site when he could, even when all he could do was talk to the security guard. In doing so, he discovered four lessons in developing a circle of competence:The first lesson was that stocks represent partial ownership in a businessThe second point is that when you start looking at things from an ownersxe2x80x99 point of view, your understanding of business will be completely differentWhen analysts join our company, the first thing we do is to send them to study some companies. We ask them to assume an uncle theyxe2x80x99ve never met before has passed away and left them the business. What should they do? They suddenly inherit this asset but have no idea what it is. You must call a board meeting and participate in the discussion. This is the mental model we ask them to use when they conduct their research.Popularised by Buffett, the idea of a circle of competence is that you should develop a deep understanding of an industry or issue. You should also understand where the limits of your knowledge lie, and not overextend yourself.These first two lessons are similar to the earlier point about viewing shareholdings as part ownership. Regardless of how large your stake is in the company, Li Lu is saying that you should view yourself as a full owner. That mindset will motivate you to continue wanting to know as much about the company as possible, and understand what decisions are good vs bad for the company's future. Spending so much time on a single name naturally limits the amount of companies you can look at, which will narrow your circle of competence.The third point is that knowledge is indeed cumulative but you must always maintain intellectual honestyI've discussed being open-minded and intellectually honest before, and would again agree that this is important but hard to do. When's the last time you've changed your mind on a non-trivial issue?The last thing is that you should let your passion be your guide. Donxe2x80x99t listen to what others think of you. They have nothing to do with you. Accept that your circle of competence will be small and donxe2x80x99t worry about everything else. Making money doesnxe2x80x99t depend on how much you know; it depends on whether what you know is right or wrong. If what you know is right, you will not lose money.This is a contrast to how many other investment funds work in practice, where they usually want investment analysts to increase their coverage of names and industry sectors over time. It's hard to tell the limited partners of your fund (the ones that give you their capital for you to invest) that you're not making any changes to the portfolio, and you like the names you're already in. Keep that up long enough and they'll wonder why they're paying you to do nothing. Hence, for many funds there's an incentive to actively trade in and out of names, and the larger the set of names you know the better. This works for some places, and is not Li Lu's style.this profession doesnxe2x80x99t demand you to be especially smart, nor to have a high IQ or the best academic credentialsLi Lu describes attributes that make a successful investor, which are:The person must be independent, and not care about other's evaluationsThe person must be objective, and willing to learn alwaysThe person must have both extreme patience and extreme decisiveness when great opportunities come alongThe person must be interested in how businesses workKeeping in mind the core concepts of value investing above, these investor traits make sense. For a typical long/short fund, they'd be less concerned about (3). A typical quant fund would likely be less concerned about (4).The biggest taboo for investors is to be like Newton and be seduced by the market: to buy at the marketxe2x80x99s hottest peak and to sell at its most depressed. If you donxe2x80x99t participate in speculation and stick strictly to investing in what you understand, then you wonxe2x80x99t lose money.The best and most important thing is to have a long enough time over which to compound. Our suggestion to the average person is to only do things you understand and to stay away from everything else.Given his background as a long term value investor, it's not a surprise that he advocates for growing wealth slowly via compounding over a long term. Not everyone is patient enough to do this though.Value investing is one way of making money, and there are many other ways that have been successful for various lengths of time. Renaisssance seems to print money, for example, and they do nothing remotely related to the value investing discussed above. If you do decide to stick with value investing, Li Lu's track record speaks for itself. Think like an owner, avoid trading for the sake of it, and know what you're good at.Efficiency vs Resilience.Optionality vs Certainty.Writing your newsletter post as scheduled on the weekend vs binge watching Peaky Blinders half drunk and then having to stay up late on a weekday [13].In life, we face tradeoffs all the time.If someone tells you there's no tradeoff for something, they're either naive, or trying to sell you something. Either way, probably best to avoid them.Companies run efficiently don't have redundancies. That saves costs, until things break. But neither can you have backups for everything, since it'll be exorbitantly expensive.Leaving options opens means you have flexibility. That works until you realise you've lived your life with all the options and never settling for something. But neither should you decide on a path without having a backup plan.In all the important decisions we make, we should:learn what the explicit and implicit tradeoffs are, andimprove on our process to choose between themOn the first, explicitly writing out what you're giving up, such as with a decision journal, can be helpful. So can doing premortems. The act of fully thinking through the scenario will usually highlight concerns you were only vaguely aware of.Another way would be to get advice from others, particularly those that have had a similar decision to make in a similar context. They'll be able to flag key concerns or regrets they had. Such advice is highly variable in nature though, and could range from useful to downright harmful. What can be risky for someone might be safe for another.On the second, it's up to you to decide what framework you want to use. I can talk about optimal stopping theory, game theory, or scenario planning, but most people will find something that works for themselves. As long as you have a framework and keep a record, you should be fine.Improving in both step 1 and step 2 will lead to better decision making.I've come to believe that in the short term, it's easier to improve step 1, so I'm working on being able to ramp that process more quickly while maintaining effectiveness. It's harder to improve step 2, which will be a long term project in tracking and evaluating decisions over time. The process of improving both of these steps will also lead you to better understand what you value.We face tradeoffs all the time, we just don't like to think of them. Unfortunately, forgetting about them doesn't make them disappear. Explicitly laying out what you're giving up in process of an important decision will help reduce regret in the future.A tale of two talebs. Highly recommend, whether you love or hate Nassim Taleb.\"it is lower-income households that will suffer most from Covid-19, and because they tend to spend most of their income, the hit to their incomes will reduce the consumption share of GDP,\" Michael Pettis twitter thread on how imbalances in the economy will be resolved\"While Microsoft made $100M it shrunk the [encyclopedia] market by over $600M.

Some of our holdings date back to our inception twenty years ago.\"Most investment firms take a management fee on assets invested with them, and then a performance fee on returns from the assets. A typical fee structure is \"2 and 20\", meaning a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. If you put in $1000 and it grew to $1200, assuming the management fee is taken off ending period values, the management fee would be $24 (2% * $1200) and the performance fee $40 (20% * ($1200 - $1000)). Compare this to Li Lu's fee model which only takes performance fees after the first 6% of returns. Here there would be no management fee, and the performance fee would be $35 (25% * ($1200 - $1000 *1.06)). It's an open secret that many investment firms live off the fixed management fees from growing their assets under management rather than performance. Li Lu's model would be more beneficial for him if he believed he could generate high returns, and less beneficial if he does poorly.I believe it's the same speech previously translated on gurufocus, and Graham's version seems more comprehensive. I've (very) briefly checked the translation and it seems accurate, but I can't fully guarantee the piece obviously.

Some of those are valid questions, and perhaps some of art is indeed a money laundering or tax evasion scam [2], but let's take a closer look at why Picasso is revered. Bear in mind that I'm not an art expert, and I'm learning as I go, indeed as I write this post. To keep on topic, I'll discuss just Picasso, though Georges Braque is a key character and influencer in the time period as well.Most art is best understood with context, so let's start with Picasso's background. Picasso was born in 1881 to two artistic parents, at a time where realism in art was still popular. This included masterpieces such as \"Portrait of the Artist's Mother\" or \"Science and Charity\" below, obviously painted by someone with talent. These works were painted to capture a scene at a point in time, as though you were staring at it from one particular perspective. Notice the lifelike detail in the textures and colours, the illusion of depth and 3D appearance, and also how the casting of shadows lets you know where the light is coming from. Itxe2x80x99s as though we took a picture from one angle. In xe2x80x9cScience and Charityxe2x80x9d, notice how the crumples of the bedsheets suggests which parts are in front and which parts behind. The shading of the pillow tricks you into thinking the head is making an indentation. The brush strokes in the manxe2x80x99s bristles give a different texture to the childxe2x80x99s curls. One might think that Picasso looked at the above paintings, decided that it was all too difficult, and spent the rest of his life rebelling against tiger parenting by producing increasingly strange paintings that don't make sense. Just like how I've given up being able to afford a home, perhaps Picasso gave up on pretty pictures because he couldn't hack it.One would also be wrong [3], as both those paintings above are actually Picassos as well. Not only that, but they were done when he was less than twenty years old. Clearly, Picasso could paint, and paint as good as any of the old masters. The next time you hear someone say that Picasso had no talent, you can point them to his earlier work. Now take a look at another Picasso, painted after the two above:What's the difference? For one, the colour has changed, to the point where even someone colour blind like me can tell the difference. That's led to a major mood shift, and the entire painting feels dark, sad, painful. The image is also less realistic than before and with less detail, though we can still recognise it's a person with a guitar.What's stayed the same? We're still seeing the scene from one point of view, and just seeing one possible perspective of the subject in the painting. There's less depth, but we can still see that some things are in front of others. Itxe2x80x99s as though we took a picture from one angle and put some bad filters on.Kelly Richman-Abdou believes the shift in styles was due to depression caused by a friend's suicide; I'll defer to her knowledge. Picasso is now experimenting, moving away from realism, exploring what more there is to art than just duplicating an image.In 1907 Picasso paints a scandalous, Cezanne and African art inspired piece, \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.\" This work, of prostitutes in a Barcelona brothel, would be the start of cubism, one of the most influential movements in art and a new way of representing reality.What is going on here? Picasso is clearly no longer going for realism in his drawings. A lot of the image also feels 2D and flat, as he doesn't care about giving an illusion of three dimensional space anymore. Even more interesting is the face on the bottom right. It's inspired by African art, but also there's obviously something strange with it. The elements of the face don't align where you expect them to be, the shadows are off, almost as if you were looking at the person from multiple points of view and trying to put all of that down on a flat surface. Which is precisely what Picasso is trying to do.Recall the start where we talked about realistic drawings, where the textures and colours were lifelike, the images felt they had depth, and how everything was seen from one perspective? Picasso took all of that and flipped it, creating something that was abstract, flat, and seen from multiple points of view.xe2x80x98A headxe2x80x99, said Picasso, xe2x80x98is a matter of eyes, nose, mouth, which can be distributed in any way you likexe2x80x99.Works such as \"Girl with a Mandolin\" above do not have one perspective. Instead, imagine if you painted a nose seen from one spot, then move a few metres to the left and painted an eye seen from that spot. Then, moving above the person to paint the lips as seen from above. You'll get a bizarre blend of elements, shadows being cast all over the place, and nothing making sense, as shown in this video by MoMa. Contrast this with a typical realistic painting, and you can see why cubism was so novel and outrageous. Given how colour photography was taking off, one can imagine why painters wanted to look for something that photography could not do. If you have a tool that represents reality perfectly, what then is the point of art? Picasso and his peers are trying to send a message that therexe2x80x99s more to art than just recreating a scene.Around the same time, Picasso and Georges Braque also start popularising collages. It's one of the first types of art that uses multiple media, having not just paint but other objects pasted onto the canvas. You can see how the progression of having multiple perspectives leads to him wanting to put a collection of things together in search of meaning for a coherent whole.In xe2x80x9cStill Life with Chair Caningxe2x80x9d, Picasso has an actual rope on the edge of the painting, which also has a print of chair caning (that brown material on the bottom left used in chairs), and painted a bizarre scene on top. Hexe2x80x99s making a collage of at least three separate types of things.Why is this weird? Before this, remember that everyone just painted things. If you wanted that chair caning image, youxe2x80x99d paint it. Whatxe2x80x99s the point of your art if you just took a print and stuck it on your canvas? And then, using rope as a frame on top of that, in contrast to the luxurious frames youxe2x80x99d expect, Picasso is rejecting the status quo of art. Itxe2x80x99s a bit hard to see what he was trying to paint on the top, and this video does a good job at showing you. If you look closely, therexe2x80x99s a pipe in the top left, a glass in the middle, and a knife, fruit, and napkin on the right. All of these have been broken into multiple views, as mentioned before, to make us wonder xe2x80x9cWhat would it be like if I viewed a cafe table from different angles, all at once?xe2x80x9d  After this, Picasso moves away from multiple perspectives, to painting things the way he visualises them, in an abstract sense. He takes pieces from everywhere and puts them together in different ways, playing around with the elements that make up the object. He moves towards the surreal, unconcious, dreamlike styles that we saw in that first image. There is little attachment to reality anymore [4].xe2x80x9cI paint objects as I think them, not as I see themxe2x80x9dFrom then on until his death, Picasso continues to create art, mixing his styles and continuing to experiment. It is estimated he did >13k paintings in his lifetime, which excludes tens of thousands more prints and illustrations. Although some would be panned during his lifetime, they would later be seen as precursors of other art movements.What have we learnt in this brief history?Picasso was a talented painter, and knew what he was doing when he started breaking the rulesYou can trace the logic in his progression, and why his work evolved in the way it didHe produced a huge volume of work, continuously trying different things. Today he's known for his best pieces, not his worstPicasso demonstrated that art has appeal beyond the aesthetic. You may not find the paintings pretty (I don't), but that's not the point. In doing so, he pushed art to new boundaries.Does this matter today? Who cares if he mixed different points of view, used multiple media, or created collages? Has Picasso influenced anything?I'll leave you to decide:Source is here. Reddit is an online forum, for those unaware.Looking at you, Rothko. Ok fine they're good too, I just don't like them.

You've also probably noticed how most of them are flawed, not giving you enough precise information to decide if the thing is actually good. A 4.5 star rating doesn't mean much when everyone is also above 4 stars. Josh Breinlinger of Jackson Square discusses why this happens to marketplaces here and proposes some solutions.Ppl focus too much on screening initially, when they should focus on optimisation post acceptanceTo make sure we're on the same page, we'll define a marketplace as a platform that matches buyers and sellers. Amazon, AirBnB, Upwork are all marketplaces.Most marketplaces have some quality screening process at the start, and once you pass that you rarely get taken off the platform. Josh is saying that marketplaces should focus on the optimisation, retention, and expulsion processes more than the screening process, as these will be more effective in maintaining quality. It's the difference between measuring potential vs actual service by the provider.This makes sense, and the difficulty here is one of scale. If you run a screen and then don't care about quality after, you only need to run it once for every new participant. If you invest in regular quality evaluations, you'll have to run it multiple times, on a participant base that gets larger over time. The costs of doing the latter are likely to continue scaling with your growth, not something anyone wants to hear [2].5 star ratings can separate bad sellers but don't have enough granularity to separate good vs great5 star systems give people a false sense of precision. Since people choose 5 as the default, \"average\" rating, differentiating between good vs great is close to impossible. You can get a sense of the terrible sellers, since a 1 star review pulls down the average dramatically [3], but the difference between a 4.7 vs a 4.5 is likely noise rather than signal. If you want to know the best sellers, and most people do, 5 star ratings aren't that helpful.Even if the ratings start out effective, grade inflation over time leads to their irrelevance. The paper linked shows how raters feel pressure to give \"above average\" ratings, continuously pushing the average higher. Think about how reviews for movies, liquor, games all cluster towards the higher end of the range [4]. We aren't well calibrated to give ratings on an absolute basis.Josh assumes a normal distribution of sellers. Are there cases when this doesn't hold? I can't think of many at the moment, outside of artificially restricted platforms where the selection process is exclusive rather than inclusive. For example, if you were to create a membership club for top restaurants, the sellers wouldn't be normally distributed. This doesn't affect the validity of the point though, and perhaps even supplements it, since you want even finer granularity between the top sellers.A relative rating rather than an absolute will be better in separating the good from greatJosh gives the example of ELO ratings, most commonly used in chess, as a way to mitigate this review problem. ELO ratings compare the results of a competition between two players, awarding points for wins and deducting points for losses. By making ratings a result of comparing people relative to another, we'll get better quality information of who is good and who is great.Besides user feedback, Josh also suggests to use actual buyer behaviour as another signal of quality. If users are presented 3 different babysitting providers and consistently pick one, that provider should be given a better score. Sellers that are consistently closing sales will be seen more often.This does create a problem where new entrants find it hard to break in. For example, Amazon's first page of organic results usually returns the larger, longer tenured sellers. This is good for the marketplace in the short term since buyers can trust in the quality of the product. I'm less certain it's good in the long term since it might hide new sellers that have better quality at a lower price, who never get enough traction to survive.In a separate post, Josh talks about using response rate as a quality signal as well. All else equal, having a higher response rate in feedback means the feedback is better quality. A TV series that has 4 stars with a 100% response rate is better than a series that has 4 stars with a 10% response rate. The idea behind this is whether users like the thing enough that they can overcome the initial hurdle of providing feedback. If they didn't have a strong feeling on the subject, they wouldn't bother rating. Ambivalence is bad; the opposite of love is not hate but being ignored.The tricky part comes when one seller has a lower rating but higher response rate than another. You could make the argument that the higher response rate is a better indicator of quality, but you could also say that more people were motivated enough to give it a lower rating. It does depend on your marketplace, and perhaps you could arbitrarily define how much response rate converts into a point on ratings.Josh also discusses pricing models of marketplaces, which you can check out in the slides linked. His main points there are that marketplaces should charge fees less than the efficiency gained, that there are three primary pricing models, and optics matter in who is paying fees. I'm not going to cover these in order to keep this section on topic.If you're building a marketplace, Josh's points can be summarised as:evaluate actual rather than potential qualityuse relative rather than absolute ratings to get more granularityuse other signals beyond user feedback scores, such as actual behaviour or response rateI read \"Misunderstanding financial crises\" by Gary Gorton a few years back. It has good points on why financial crises occur, and could be rewritten to have more structure and clarity. Highlights below:Financial crises all have the same root cause - bank runs and sharp reductions in demand for deposits in the banking system. Crises occur when market participants mistrust the value of bank debt, and there's a sudden large demand for cash from the financial institutionDemand for cash is on such a scale it is not possible for the banks to meet this demand because assets cannot be sold en masse without prices plummetingCrises have happened throughout history, are sudden and unpredictableBanks are in the business of borrowing and lending money, both to consumers (retail) and companies. When you or your company deposits money into the bank, you're giving the bank a loan with the expectation you'll be able to withdraw that cash in the future. Banks in turn lend out more money than they have, in what's known as fractional reserve banking, with the expectation that not everyone will want to withdraw at the same time. This allows the supply and velocity of money (credit) in the economy to increase and provides liquidity.Consumer bank runs are largely a thing of a past, due to 1) FDIC deposit insurance and 2) the size of consumer deposits vs company deposits. It's no longer like the 1920s where 2 banks would fail a day. The bigger risk now is bank runs from institutions, be they companies or investment firms. In times of crisis, these firms want to get their cash back. When they all want it at the same time, it's impossible for the banks to fulfil that demand.I'll skip over the nuances of how these companies keep their cash; if you've read about the terms repo, commercial paper, or revolving credit lately, those would fall under that umbrella. To simplify, banks have obligations to companies in a variety of forms, and companies are now calling on those obligations to get cash [5].The main point here is that liquidity is the cause of crises, not capital. The bank could still have a lot of capital in the form of illiquid assets, but be unable to provide enough cash on demand at that moment. And the bank can't even sell the less liquid assets at a good price, since it's a crisis, resulting in a downward spiral of liquidity.Markets are liquid when there is nothing to know or nothing worth knowing; when there aren't secretsConversely, when there are too many unknowns, liquidity stops. In the 08 crisis, banks didn't want to lend to each other because they didn't know which other bank was insolvent. Now, people don't know when normal business will resume, and which businesses will survive. That's why the Fed is stepping in to try and increase liquidity and provide a known source of funds.The banking system has always been viewed as too big to fail. No society has intentionally liquidated its banking system; instead they choose not to enforce debt contracts. They do so by:allowing suspension of convertibility (no withdrawals) or declaring bank holidays (total suspension of all bank services)declaring banks not insolvent even if they do not pay their debtbailouts of bad assetsMoney and credit is critical to society as it stands currently, and has been for centuries now. It's the inherent tradeoff in having fractional banking, since credit relies on trust. In good times when trust is high, liquidity isn't a concern, credit is extended, and economic activity occurs. In bad times when trust is low, liquidity disappears, credit is withdrawn, and economic activity stalls [6].Goodness is not goodness that seeks advantage. Good is good in the final hour, in the deepest pit, without hope, without witness, without reward. Virtue is only virtue in extremis [7]I can't predict when this crisis will end. I hope it's soon, though I fear it's not.What I can predict is that this crisis will show people for who they really are. Crises reveal the best but also the worst in us. There will be those that help and those that harm. Those that keep their word and those that break it. Those that make their reputation and those that disgrace it.Choose which group you want to be. Choose wisely. The city of Paris has a motto, Fluctuat nec mergitur, meaning \"tossed by the waves, but does not sink\". I'd like to believe this applies to all of us. We're in for a rocky time, but will weather this storm as we always have, by helping each other. I have no doubt that we will pull through this. Bruised but not broken, we'll recover having reassessed who and what matters most. And one day we'll be telling stories of how we survived by coming together as a community [8].I also have no doubt that these will sound like hollow platitudes if you've been personally affected by the crisis. In my biggest failures, I heard them all - time heals all wounds, failure is one step to success, losing opens up new opportunities. I instinctively knew them to be true, but honestly didn't give a shit then.And that's ok. It's ok to be feeling what you're feeling now. Frightened. Enraged. Lost.But know that those feelings will fade, and you're better than your temporary temperaments. For man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated. And when you're ready, there are people standing by to help.If you do need help, there are some resources in the \"Other\" section below that might be worth checking out.And if you're fortunate enough to be able to help, the \"Other\" section also highlights ways to do so. It's ok if you're not in a position to help right now; xe2x80x9csecure your oxygen maskxe2x80x9d first.In these trying times, we'll be tossed by waves of fear and hopelessness, but will not sink to despair. If we all help rather than harm, we can get through this. Reach out, even if it's just to one person. You can make a larger difference than you think.If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching, Or cool one pain, Or help one fainting robin Unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain [9]I met with Nick Arkinson of Levatso Holdings, who's looking to buy a majority stake in a growing company.

Firstly, there's lack of deposit insurance that will cover balances that large. Secondly, that cash would earn less return. Hence companies enter into repo, treasuries, and other arrangements, in which they exchange their cash for short term liabilities from others. When people think Google has $100bn of cash, that's true - kinda. It does have that amount in total liquid assets, but only a fraction of it in cash equivalents, and the majority in securities. See their 2019 10K page 50, cash and cash equivalents vs marketable securitiesThe book also discusses four types of potential costs from financial crises: 1) deadweight loss from fiscal transfers from taxpayers to institutions, 2) output loss and increase in unemployment, 3) misallocation of resources due to actions taken to ameliorate the crisis, 4) costs to social well being. We can reduce these costs with good policy but cannot eliminate them, and should expect these to occur in every crisisDoctor WhoI was going to write about the trend of niche irl communities that have been gaining popularity this month such as Not Boring Club, Inter Intellect, Get Real etc. Given the situation though I'll reserve that for later.Emily DickinsonFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Fluctuat nec mergitur - Avoid Boring People","url":"https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/fluctuat-nec-mergitur"}

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here.You wouldnxe2x80x99t think it, but this white paper and its super boring title - xe2x80x9cCommunity-Centered Wireless Infrastructure Networksxe2x80x9d - is a declaration of war by Google against big telecom.Why is that? Well, Google and Eric Schmidt are running a campaign to lobby cities to have them own and control their own broadband system, instead of the way it works now, where they allow AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile to do so. Most people think that telecom is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, but cities actually have a significant role in telecom deployment, because you have to attach equipment to all sorts of municipal infrastructure and it is muni governments that oversee such activities. In fact, cities were the first telephone regulators in the late 19th century, and had significant authority all the way until the Telecom Act of 1996, spurred by merchants who demanded that cities regulate telephones so there wouldnxe2x80x99t be wires strung all over the city streets from competing phone networks.Itxe2x80x99s now back to the future. Schmidt, along with a host of philanthropists and tech money, is saying that cities should work with a xe2x80x98neutral host partner,xe2x80x99 aka a public utility, when rolling out 5G services, not a xe2x80x98retail provider,xe2x80x99 which would be your standard telecom. In other words, cities should run the infrastructure. All hail Comrade Schmidt and his call for public agencies to own the means of production.In truth, Schmidt just wants cities to open up the wireless market for competition so big tech firms can enter the game by underpricing telecom service. In doing so, he is engaging a direct strike at the business model of retail telecom players. Itxe2x80x99s a return shot at telecom firms, who have been going after Google for the last few years in various ways. Herexe2x80x99s AT&T, for instance, calling for reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law underpinning Googlexe2x80x99s business modelIn comments this Wednesday, AT&T will join the growing consensus of voices concluding that online platforms should be more accountable for, and more transparent about, the decisions they control that fundamentally shape how we communicate, learn, shop, and are informed and entertained.  We argue first that the dominant online platforms owe the public greater transparency about the choices made on their platforms.  Such transparency is considered table stakes in every discussion about broadband networks owned by ISPs.Google and big telecom have been going at it since the late 2000s, when Google backed net neutrality to block the desire of AT&T to create physical wireline chokeholds over internet services. The battle is only getting more intense, and both sides are actually pushing for the public interest, but only when it comes to their opponent.One of the most fun parts of being part of the anti-monopoly movement is that you get to root for the monopolist who suddenly becomes anti-monopolist when his interests are threatened. Wheee!Donxe2x80x99t trust bust me, donxe2x80x99t trust bust thee, attack the monopoly behind the tree.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.This is just another way to capture user information. The mobile network operators are capturing usage activity, tying it very precisely to location. I'm convinced they're making a killing on this data. Google wants to bump them out of the way, and enter the market, and capture it directly, expanding their reach even further, and becoming even more of an advertising monopoly in the process.This reminds me of a truth that hit me in 2018 or 2019. Google and its allies largely invented the phony bogeyman of \"net neutrality\" back in 2014 or so to attack the legacy telecom and content distributors. I hold no brief for them. But Google's strategy, in full alliance with the Obama-Biden White House, was to distract everyone else from the the *real* monopolist in the room. A few people, like Scott Galloway, were already wise to Big Tech way back when, six years ago, and calling for their breakup. I'm sure the Borg took notice.No posts","title":"Google ex-CEO Eric Schmidt Calls for Full Communism - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/google-ex-ceo-eric-schmidt-calls"}

It is now the consensus that Obamaxe2x80x99s lack of ambition led to Trumpxe2x80x99s election. For instance, party leader Senator Chuck Schumer recently called the Obama stimulus a xe2x80x9cmistakexe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9ca small measly proposalxe2x80x9d on CNN, as a way of selling Bidenxe2x80x99s much larger proposals.

Last week, the Biden administration laid out a $2 trillion vision on infrastructure called the American Jobs Plan. The theory behind the American Jobs Plan is that the U.S. has a few key challenges, all related to the physical design of the country. We have to wean ourselves off of Chinese imports, deal with climate change, and create a more equal economy. The American Jobs Plan is the proposed solution. It will do everything from expand broadband to repair roads and bridges using xe2x80x9ccleaner cement and steel,xe2x80x9d upgrade ports and electric grids, subsidize semiconductor factory investment, and on and on, all with inputs xe2x80x9cmade in America and shipped on U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed vessels.xe2x80x9d Itxe2x80x99s a bold vision. One important question is whether itxe2x80x99s actually possible to spend that amount of money on so many things without immense amounts of corruption or waste. The difference between FDR and Obama, after all, was not just spending amounts. Obama didnxe2x80x99t spend enough, but he did spend a lot. FDR, however, actually built things, whereas Obamaxe2x80x99s stimulus money for, say, Californiaxe2x80x99s high-speed rail, evaporated into a cloud of consultants.  (A particularly mean joke was that FDR won WWII in less time than it took Obama to build Obamacare web sites that didnxe2x80x99t work.)Biden isnxe2x80x99t inheriting a well-functioning government, so pushing $2 trillion through a battered public sector is going to lead to problems. To understand Bidenxe2x80x99s challenge, we should go to the last time America had to build a bunch of infrastructure. In 2017, in Puerto Rico, hurricane Maria wiped out the islandxe2x80x99s electric grid. If you want to know the nightmare scenario for Bidenxe2x80x99s infrastructure plan, start there.When I was a Senate staffer, one of the worst pieces of legislation I worked on was called PROMESA. It was June of 2016, and Puerto Rico was having trouble paying back $70B+ of its state debt. There are no bankruptcy provisions for U.S. territories, so Congress stepped in and appointed a control board of bankers and technocrats to govern the island, the idea being that the democratically elected government had been fiscally reckless, and the Federal government should step in. The control board hired McKinsey, the management consulting firm, as the islandxe2x80x99s xe2x80x98strategic consultant,xe2x80x99 with the goal of getting Puerto Rico back to fiscal solvency. A little over a year after Congress passed PROMESA, hurricane Maria hit. Puerto Ricoxe2x80x99s water, health and electric systems were weak, which the hurricane exposed by ripping through the islandxe2x80x99s physical plant.  For the last five years, McKinsey has detailed highly paid consultants to help the control board both renegotiate debt and oversee infrastructure spending. Has the rebuild gone well? In short, no. The unelected control board has allowed the awarding of electric grid contracts to corrupt insiders, so power outages are still common. Mass protests forced the governorxe2x80x99s resignation in 2019. And schools are closing even as the government continues to pay government salaries to people who donxe2x80x99t work for the government.So what has McKinsey been doing, if it hasnxe2x80x99t been running Puerto Rico? The answer is, McKinsey has been looking out for McKinsey. It has ensured that Puerto Rico will spend the mind-bogglingly large sum of $1.5 billion on professional services, meaning lawyers, bankers, and consultants (including McKinsey), which is five times what Detroit paid in services for its bankruptcy. I donxe2x80x99t know how much the firm will make, but according to the GSA schedule, just one recent college graduate working at McKinsey costs around $3 million a year. Beyond the straight fee extraction, the conflicts of interest are comical; McKinseyxe2x80x99s internal hedge fund actually owns Puerto Rican bonds.Far from an anomaly, such a situation for McKinsey is common. McKinsey helped ruin the U.S. spying apparatus with a bloated, failed contract. They helped run Trumpxe2x80x99s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; ICE even hired McKinsey to write its own contract. McKinsey structured Francexe2x80x99s terrible coronavirus response, and that of New York state. McKinsey is so brazen that it was caught by the GSA Inspector General for cheating the government out of $65 million. It didnxe2x80x99t seem to matter. In 2019, McKinsey worked for more than 15 federal agencies and departments, and 25 states.This broad range of clients gives McKinsey a cartel-like relationships with the circle of law firms, investment banks, and fellow professional services firms involved in bankruptcies, infrastructure spending, and other specialized institutional work. Joe Bidenxe2x80x99s infrastructure plan is a good plan, in theory. We need to do a lot of what Biden wants to do. The problem is that every overpriced government contractor out there is gearing up to steal as much of the $2 trillion as they can. And they will try to steal it the way McKinsey has, by taking advantage of bad policy choices that turned the government into a sucker.If Biden wants to make his plan functional, he should follow FDRxe2x80x99s model.Rooseveltxe2x80x99s first major infrastructure battle was over Muscle Shoals in Alabama, the great hydroelectric resource. The Morgan interests and the electric utility magnates wanted that resource privatized for their use. Roosevelt said no, and had the government directly build the Tennessee Valley Authority, a publicly owned and operated electric utility for much of Appalachia. TVA was part of a package of reforms to constrain and control Wall Street, to end what FDR called the xe2x80x98informal economic government of the United States.xe2x80x99Over the rest of the New Deal, FDR transformed the physical plant of the country, and spent a lot of money on infrastructure. But Roosevelt first made sure Wall Street had little say over how public money or public resources were spent. Public institutions got bigger and more competent, and the financiers and monopolists lost power. One key result is that the government could do big things. During World War II, military procurement officers had immense capacity and power, imposing tight control over contractors, and ensuring that there were at least a dozen competitors for each major weapon system. They could peer into the books of contractors, and even claw back excessive profits. America used this governing capacity for decades, constructing the national highway system, winning the space race, deploying the polio vaccine, landing on the moon and building the internet, and running the project Sematech in the 1980s to address foreign threats to semiconductors.In the 1990s, however, Bill Clintonxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cReinventing Governmentxe2x80x9d initiative killed the public capacity Roosevelt had constructed. Clinton encouraged the big prime defense contractors to merge, shrinking them from over 100 to just 5 firms. Clintonxe2x80x99s procurement initiative, led by Steve Kelman, invented a whole new vocabulary for ways to let contractors steal. The details get complex, but the gist was a xe2x80x98light touchxe2x80x99 approach to negotiating by the government. Procurement officers stopped making hard-nosed demands for better prices, and were stripped of the ability to look at the books of the contractors to make sure there werenxe2x80x99t excess profits.Government began using a new set of contracts to get rid of competition and negotiating in contracting; today, agencies can just order stuff from pre-approved contractors without doing much negotiating. Procurement officers donxe2x80x99t have to write a full-blown solicitation with clear specifications, and contractors no longer have to put together a real proposal. Therexe2x80x99s very little competition in any of it. And contractors are eager to make the system even worse, with some asking for Biden to stop requiring them to list any prices at all when selling to the government.This kind of buying system - no prices, no transparency, no competition - is precisely the opposite of what firms like Amazon, Walmart, and other xe2x80x98power buyersxe2x80x99 do to wring efficiency from their suppliers. Walmart, for instance, goes into excruciating detail to learn everything about its suppliers, making detailed demands about every facet of every product, including price. Unlike the government, Walmart acts like a monopoly buyer, and demands value for its money.The problem isnxe2x80x99t just that Uncle Sam gets ripped off. The net effect of encouraging laziness and monopoly throughout the government procurement process is poorly thought out initial requirements, which of course results in bloated costs and failed projects later on. If you half-ass an initial proposal, the cost will explode when youxe2x80x99ve built half of it, and find out youxe2x80x99ve built it wrong. This problem is pervasive throughout America; New York City, for instance, is on the verge of collapse, and infrastructure costs in the U.S. are laughably expensive. (I did a bunch of interviews with people in construction to find out why, and the best explanation I got was because American public officials tend to change requirements a lot more in the middle of projects.)All of this boils down to hiring capable people as procurement officers, demanding they be aggressive in negotiating with contractors, and breaking up large firms so there is competition over the governmentxe2x80x99s business. It also means no longer using firms like McKinsey, because such firms donxe2x80x99t actually offer any value. There is hope. Operation Warp Speed, which super-charged vaccine development and roll-out, was probably the most effective government project since the moon landings. And ideologically, therexe2x80x99s a lot more interest in the public sector these days. Nevertheless, the financial power spread out among bankers, government contractors, Silicon Valley monopolists, private equity shops, and management consultants is going to be a real problem, since each will try to grab as much of that infrastructure money as possible and do as little work to get it as possible. That will become clear over time, as infrastructure spending scandals inevitably emerge. Hopefully, Biden will take the right lesson, and begin reconstructing capacity in the public sector.If he doesnxe2x80x99t, his legacy wonxe2x80x99t be the New Deal. Itxe2x80x99ll be a failed Presidency, and a lot of new Teslas for government contractors. Ending the Safety Razor Cartel: Why Blocking Mergers Is Good for Business: Stopping mergers is good for business. Take a very simple consumer product - razors and razor blades for shaving, or disposable wet shave safety razors.Razor blades are an overpriced product with known excess profits, so much so that selling low-margin razors so you can sell high-margin razor blades in the aftermarket is now a business strategy cliche. The razor business is, like most consumer packaged products, all about distribution. Prior to the internet, that meant getting into stores. \"Shelf space is diamond-encrusted gold. It's exposure to the consumer and everyone wants exposure to the consumer,\" said one retail analyst in 2005.Gillette, now a part of P&G, had so much power that it still controlled 70% of the market in 2010, even though razors as a disposable wet shave razor product are more than 50 years old (with Schick controlling the rest). And the incumbents exploited their power, with yearly annual price increases and nice margins for a commodity product. (This market power insulated P&G from having to compete, so the consumer conglomerate now is a giant sleepy company whose workers donxe2x80x99t really do much work.)In 2013, Harryxe2x80x99s launched, challenging the duopoly of P&G and Schick by going direct to consumer online. A similar firm, Dollar Shave Club, also entered the space. Both firms sold razors cheaper than the giants, but did so only online, which meant that the incumbents maintained much of their power by controlling retail shelf space. However, in 2016, Harryxe2x80x99s got shelf placement in Walmart, Target, and other big box stores. The result is Schick and P&G had to cut prices.Enter the buyouts. In 2016, Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club, in a transaction that should have been challenged by the Obama DOJ, but was not. Still, Harryxe2x80x99s continued putting pressure on the giants. Three years later, Schick tried to take out the remaining challenger by buying Harryxe2x80x99s. The FTC, however, filed a case against the merger, and Schick walked away from the deal.Opponents of stronger antitrust laws say that blocking mergers will harm the economy. Is that true? Dan Primack in Axios Pro Rata published a story on what happened next. The CEO of Harryxe2x80x99s, Jeff Raider, raised $155 million from Bain Capital Ventures and Macquarie Capital at a higher valuation than Schick had offered, with the goal of using this money to expand its product line. As Raider put it: \"We had expanded into other standalone brands on our own and were super excited about taking over their portfolio, but when the deal didn't go through we still thought we had come up with compelling ideas.\"Today Harryxe2x80x99s product line xe2x80x9cincludes men's and women's shaving products, shampoos, deodorants, lotions and even fresh cat food.xe2x80x9d And Raider wants to expand more. In other words, blocking this merger helped everyone in the market - consumers got cheaper razors, Harryxe2x80x99s owners got more value, and now therexe2x80x99s going to be more competition in consumer packaged goods more generally. The only entities who lost out were P&G and Schick.The Big Dumb Ship Problem Is Much Worse Than We Think: I got a bunch of fascinating responses to my last issue of BIG, What Can We Learn from a Big Boat Stuck in a Canal? I found this one particularly insightful.Hi Matt,You said in your note belowxe2x80xa6   xe2x80x9c...frankly, we should have seen this coming, because a lot of people have been noticing supply chain fragility, even if Thomas Friedman didnxe2x80x99t.\"Well some of us in the industry have been aware of this for a very long time and have been writing about it. Tom Friedman is a nice guy, along with all of the other observers of how the world should be working. But logistics and supply chain management is usually considered boring and get almost no airtimexe2x80xa6 until this!The concentration of risk in these E+ Class ships is huge. Actually though, a bigger risk to global commerce is if one of these monsters falls over in the entrance channel to a regional hub, such as Rotterdam or Long Beach. Blocking Suez is one thing as there is an alternative (sail round the horn of Africa) albeit taking more time. But blocking access to Rotterdam hits traffic in an out. Diversion are possible, but this impacts road and rail links into and out of the alternatives (e.g Hamburg, Le Havre). These cannot be replicated at scale fast enough for the present velocity of global trade.

Itxe2x80x99s not so much the bags in the system that are a problem, itxe2x80x99s the bags arriving on inbound flights and the bags arriving with passengers for outbound flights. Now scale this up to billions of dollars of containers with general cargo, bulk carriers with commodities such as grain or ore, Ro Ro vessels, etc. etc. etc.I have done several studies including one for the US Government (related to the potential of terrorist exploitation) awhile ago about the likely impact of events such as this. Back then the biggest ships were around 10K TEU per vessel, but even they were too big for many ports to handle. In the US, Halifax on the East coast and Long Beach on the west coast, can reliably handle the 24K TEU ships. The scale of cranes needed to offload them is also a challenge, as are the bayplan systems to operate the loading/offloading process. Get that wrong and the balance goes and the ship flips. This is not uncommon in some parts of the world.Finally, the dirty little secret of global shipping is the number of mis-declarations on the manifests. This is why when some vessels catch fire, even though the containers are identified in the firefighting systems, a full on emergency is declared as the master and ship owners cannot trust what the manifest says.

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6Today Ixe2x80x99ll be writing about the big boat stuck in the Suez Canal. This situation is a very simple and dumb disruption to global trade, and it is precisely the simplicity and stupidity at work that lets us peak beneath the glossy sheen of trade happy talk that has fooled us for so long.In this newsletter, I do a lot of explaining about complicated problems caused by big dumb corporate institutions. I donxe2x80x99t have to do that this time, because the story of the mess in the Suez is so simple. xe2x80x9cAfter years of bitcoin and reddit short selling and credit default swaps and a million other things I donxe2x80x99t understand,xe2x80x9d one random person put in a tweet that went viral, xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s so refreshing to hear that global commerce is in peril because a big boat got stuck in a canal.xe2x80x9d Thatxe2x80x99s basically the story right there, itxe2x80x99s a big boat and it got stuck in a canal. The ship blocking the Suez, called the Ever Given, weighs 220,000 tons, and is as long as the Empire State Building is high. Despite the hilarious nature of the problem, the disruption to world trade is large and serious, costing tens of billions of dollars. And if the ship canxe2x80x99t be dislodged soon, some consumers will once again experience shortages of basic staples like toilet paper. (UPDATE: It was dislodged.)That said, the reason this disruption to global commerce seems so dumb is because it is. It starts with the ship size itself. Over the last few decades, ships have gotten really really big, four times the size of what they were 25 years ago, what the FT calls xe2x80x9ctoo big to sail.xe2x80x99 The argument behind making such massive boats was efficiency, since you can carry more at a lower cost. The downside of such mega-ships should have been obvious. Ships like this, which are in effect floating islands, are really hard to steer in tight spaces like ports and canals, and if they get stuck, they are difficult to unstick. In other words, the super smart wizard financiers who run global trade made ships that donxe2x80x99t fit in the canals they need to fit into. The rise of mega-ships is paralleled by the consolidation of the shipping industry itself. In 2000, the ten biggest shipping companies had a 12% market share, by 2019 that share had increased to 82%. This understates the consolidation, because there are alliances among these shippers. The stuck ship is being run by the Taiwanese shipping conglomerate Evergreen, which bought Italian shipping firm Italia Marittima in 1998 and London-based Hatsu in 2002, and is itself part of the OCEAN alliance, which has more than a third of global shipping. Making ships massive, and combining such massive ships into massive shipping monopolies, is a bad way to run global commerce. Wexe2x80x99ve already seen significant problems from big shipping lines helping to transmit financial shocks into trade shocks, such as when Korean shipper Hanjin went under and stranded $14 billion of cargo on the ocean while in bankruptcy. Itxe2x80x99s also much harder for small producers and retailers to get shipping space, because large shippers want to deal with large clients. And fewer ports can handle these mega-ships, so such ships induce geographical inequality. Increasingly, wexe2x80x99re not moving ships between cities, wexe2x80x99re moving cities to where the small number of giant shipping lines find it efficient to ship.Dumb big ships owned by monopolies are the result of dumb big ideas, the physical manifestation of  what Thomas Friedman was pushing in the 1990s and 2000s with books such as The Lexus and the Olive Tree and The World is Flat, the idea that xe2x80x9ctaking fat out of the system at every jointxe2x80x9d was leading towards a more prosperous, peaceful and competitive world. Friedmanxe2x80x99s was a finance-friendly perspective, a belief that making us all interdependent with a very thin margin of error would force global cooperation.  Just make ships bigger, went the thinking, until a big boat got stuck in a canal, taking down global supply chains with it. It seems so dumb. And it is. But itxe2x80x99s also reality, because for whatever reason, a lot of powerful people at one point thought Thomas Friedman was a genius. And frankly, we should have seen this coming, because a lot of people have been noticing supply chain fragility, even if Thomas Friedman didnxe2x80x99t.I had been paying attention to supply chains and shortages for about a decade, when I noticed that Hollywood was freaking out over a lack of video tapes. People who made TV were frantically working to get tapes they could use to make shows. The NBA scrambled to get enough tape to broadcast the NBA finals, with one executive saying, xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s like a bank run.xe2x80x9d Who needed video tapes in 2010? And why would there be shortages?It turns out that this situation was far weirder and more serious that I expected. Specific kinds of specialized video tapes were necessary, not to watch shows, but to film them. And the Fukushima earthquake halfway around the world had knocked offline a Sony factory that was the major source of supply.  What I was seeing is what is known an industrial supply chain crash, like a bank run, only with actual inputs and outputs of real world stuff.This wasnxe2x80x99t the first industrial supply chain crash in the era of globalization created in the 1990s. The first recorded one was in 1999, when an earthquake in Taiwan hit semiconductor production, causing factories all over the U.S. to shut down and firms like Dell and Hewlett-Packard to stop selling computers. Other industrial crashes or near-crashes soon followed, happening for an array of reasons. In 2004, England shut down a single flu vaccine factory, and the U.S. lost half its flu vaccine supply. The Chinese government cut off rare earth mineral exports to Japan, with rare earth minerals being a pivotal input into electronics. Hurricane Maria caused an IV bag shortage, as Puerto Rico shut production. Then came Covid, which showed just how vulnerable the 1990s thinned out supply chain model of globalization had made us. Nurses and doctors wore garbage bags and got Covid because we didnxe2x80x99t have enough personal protection equipment and our producers couldnxe2x80x99t ramp up production quickly. Sometimes the shortages were comical; we lacked enough nasal swabs because the monopoly producer was a Maine-based family-owned company whose owners were cousins who hated each other so much they refused to speak. Then therexe2x80x99s the current semiconductor crisis. Taiwan Semiconductor is effectively a global monopoly in contract production for high end chips, and its capacity is outstripped by demand. Meanwhile, other forms of chip manufacturing and petrochemical refining shut down in Texas due to the arctic blast, which is amplifying problems on top of already brittle supply chains. The net effect is that there are now  shortages of popular consumer electronics, and auto manufacturers, who depend on microchips, are now shutting production as they lack necessary chip inputs.Semiconductors and Suez are the most prominent supply chain disruptors, but there are shortages wherever you look. We are still in shortage of hundreds of pharmaceutical products, including salt water in a bag. Bedding makers are having trouble getting access to foam, ammunition makers canxe2x80x99t get enough metal and primers, RVs are in short supply, as are fridges, air conditioners and furniture, and therexe2x80x99s still a basic lack of shipping containers. And these shortages are often in critical components that can shut down whole industries. For instance, flat steel form ties, a small piece of metal that ties together aluminum panels to make basement walls, are a critical part in short supply in the construction industry. These cost about a dollar, but without them, you canxe2x80x99t build a home with a basement or crawl space. Tom Woods, a 55-year industry veteran building homes in Missouri, called this shortage xe2x80x9ccatastrophic,xe2x80x9d noting that xe2x80x9cIf you don't pour any basements or walls, then you're not going to build any houses.xe2x80x9d(And those are just the reported shortages. I hear about other shortages all the time. A friend has been waiting months for a steel mounting plate for a winch on his jeep, which is a part that a year ago he could have gotten same day. Ixe2x80x99m told big farm equipment manufacturers are having trouble sourcing steel for bailers and tractors.)Industrial crashes, in other words, are happening in unpredictable ways throughout the economy, shutting down important production systems in semi-random fashion. Such collapses were relatively rare prior to the 1990s. But industrial crashes were built into the nature of our post-1990s production system, which prioritizes efficiency over resiliency. Just as ships like the Ever Given are bigger and more efficient, they are also far riskier. And this tolerance for risk is a pattern reproducing itself far beyond the shipping industry; wexe2x80x99ve off shored production and then consolidated that production in lots of industries, like semiconductors, pharmaceutical precursors, vitamin C, and even book printing. What is new isnxe2x80x99t the vulnerability of the Suez Canal as a chokepoint, itxe2x80x99s that wexe2x80x99ve intentionally created lots of other artificial chokepoints. And since our production systems have little fat, these systems are tightly coupled, meaning a shortage in one area cascades throughout the global economy, costing us time, money, and lives.Itxe2x80x99s a dumb way to organize a global supply chain system, just as it was dumb to build ships that are too big to fit into canals. And thatxe2x80x99s why the \"big boat stuck in canal\" is such a great illustration of the problem, it shows our policymakers and corporate leaders couldnxe2x80x99t even think through what would happen if Really Big Thing Got Stuck In Important Canal.The answer to addressing the problem of thinned out supply chains is to recognize that hyper-efficient globalization inherently carries the downside of unpredictable shortages, geopolitical tension, and supply disruptions. And then redesign our global trading order to make it less efficient and more resilient. There are three basic changes wexe2x80x99ll need. First, we need to restore anti-monopoly rules, such as antitrust, to prevent the consolidation of production and distribution in the first place. Second, we should re-impose friction, like tariffs, in global trading so that we relocalize production. Trade is generally a good thing, but every country or geographic bloc should be able to provide itself with the essentials, in case there are disruptions. Third, we should rapidly restructure the way that firms finance themselves, so that they have less debt. Debt is a cruel taskmaster, and it leads CEOs to cut deeply not just into fat but into muscle and bone.These principles sound simple, and they are, but using them to design a new system will take time and effort. Fortunately, policymakers and business leaders are moving in that direction. Therexe2x80x99s a rethink of antitrust going on globally, with the most forward looking proposals in the U.S., where they can actually be put into practice. Relocalizing production is also happening. The new CEO of Intel, for instance, marked out an exciting path with a refocus on production of semiconductors in the U.S. and Europe. Finally, changing the way our corporations finance themselves is also on the table; the debt-heavy private equity model is, finally, under attack.It wonxe2x80x99t be an easy transition. While the problem is conceptually simple, there are trillions of dollars of sunk infrastructure invested in the current model, and financiers and monopolists very much like what they have now. After all, one personxe2x80x99s bottleneck supply disruptor is another personxe2x80x99s extremely profitable tollbooth. Itxe2x80x99s also a scary situation. We havenxe2x80x99t, for instance, ever seen our global supply chain put under the strain of a powerful entity that truly wants to disrupt commerce for geopolitical ends, and what that might look like it frightening. Even without that incentive, having lots of bottlenecks and chokepoints heightens the stakes of territorial influence; Chinese and the U.S. both see Taiwan as a flashpoint for global conflict, in part because of its critical place in semiconductors. At any rate, all of these problems are manageable, if we take the many hints we have gotten over the years about the the dangerous way we are organizing our global systems, and restructure the way we produce things and trade with one another. Pandemics will happen. So will earthquakes. Boats are sometimes going to get stuck in canals. We should recognize these things happen when re-designing a global trading system. Thanks for reading.

With monopoly, there are existing enforcement mechanisms that are under utilized. With corporate financing and governance issues, I assume there aren't...? If we return to previous models where companies actually kept reserves, they'd just be targets for looting again.  Also there is the issue of replacing equity with debt in stock buybacks, leveraged buyouts etc.  Curious what has been proposed as possible fixes / alternatives.  Thanks! Here's another disaster-in-waiting: global phosphorus supply, critical to global food supply, and by extension our survival.In commercial agriculture (which is another mechanism in dire need of reform at every level), phosphate rock, along with a nitrogen source, is fertilizer. No phosphorus, no food. Western Sahara and Morocco have by far the largest reserves with U.S., India, and China's known domestic supply all used up within a generation at current use rates. While not an artificial monopoly situation (although if I recall correctly Morroco's 1975 invasion/occupation of Western Sahara was motivated by the cash cow of phosphate rock) it's a supply chain project that we have time to mitigate if solutions are implemented soon.Democracy Now! did a great piece on Western Sahara (they got busted as press while there and it got a bit hairy): https://www.democracynow.org/2018/8/31/four_days_in_occupied_western_saharaThere are articles about it here and there but it's hard to get people motivated to think about and act on a crisis that hasn't ocurred yet.

Once Northrop got its hand on the dominant rocket motor producer, it denied competitors access. And voila, Boeing dropped out of the bidding for the nuclear missile upgrade, and Northrop became the sole bidder. So Northrop gets to set the price for missiles, unless Congress bargains aggressively or the FTC unwinds the merger. Letxe2x80x99s start with Congress.  As it turns out, monopolist Northrop is a big donor to the group of Senators who support spending more money on these missiles, informally known as the ICBM Coalition.The efforts of the ICBM Coalition have been supplemented by lobbying and campaign contributions from ICBM contractors, led by Northrop Grumman, which has received a sole source, $13.3 billion contract to build a new ICBM, known formally as the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, or GBSD. Current estimates indicate that building and operating the GBSD and related warheads will cost $264 billion over the life of the program, which would provide a steady flow of revenue to Northrop Grumman and associated companies for years to come.A quarter of a trillion dollar sole source contract? Not bad, Northrop.There is an answer, of course. Unwind the Orbital acquisition. Itxe2x80x99s actually not that hard, since Northrop is violating the FTC consent decree it signed when buying the firm, a decree whose condition was that it wasnxe2x80x99t allowed to deny rocket engines to competitors.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.HALP can you write about rental car co. consolidations and the deliberate reduction of inventory (cars available) in order to drive prices sky-high.  It is impossible in my area to reserve a rental 2 days in advance for less that $200 a day for an ECONOMY CAR.  I can literally show you the $600 (3 day rental) quote from Avis.   Standard rates are less for Alamo/Enterprise but they are perpetually sold out.What about building the missiles at government facilities?  For example the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.  The US Army and US Navy at one time operated a number of arsenal, shipyards and other facilities to produce armaments.  Recall the issue of the Frankford Arsenal in the 1976 presidential race?I recall that it was regarded as scandalous that ships built in naval yards cost more than did ships from civilian yards.  But once the naval shipyards stopped producing ships there was a dramatic escalation in the price of warships.  It was seemingly a case of being penny wise and pound foolish.  And a number of civilian yards which once built ships for the US Navy have closed anyway as the shipbuilding budget has become a funnel to transfer wealth to a few large corporations.No posts","title":"How a Nuclear Missile Monopolist Is Getting a Quarter Trillion Dollar Pentagon Contract - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-a-nuclear-missile-monopolist"}

While Ixe2x80x99m not a fan of banning people from social networks, I do think therexe2x80x99s an interesting question about why Facebook didnxe2x80x99t act to boot QAnon before the election.One rumor is that had Facebook done so, executives were afraid of losing users to conservative social networks Parler and Gab, which would in turn limit Facebookxe2x80x99s ad revenue. This led to me to the question, how much money has Facebook made from its moderation choice to retain QAnon groups? Exact amounts of money are impossible to know without Facebookxe2x80x99s internal data, but itxe2x80x99s possible to do a back of the envelope guess on why Facebook did not want to purge its networks of conspiracy theories.According to NPR, 17% of Americans believe in the core tenet of QAnon. Letxe2x80x99s say that half of them, or 8% of Americans, had moved on from Facebook, as happened to MySpace when a more compelling social network emerged. As of 2020, Facebook had 258 million users in the U.S. and Canada, and its average revenue per user was $163.86. Letxe2x80x99s pretend no one in Canada buys into QAnon, so wexe2x80x99re talking 220 million American Facebook users. That means Facebook feared losing 17.6 million users if they banned QAnon content, which is a loss of roughly $2.9 billion of ad revenue in 2020.Obviously this calculation is rough, and itxe2x80x99s not clear that anyone would leave Facebook if it banned QAnon. Still, my guess is that someone at Facebook made the calculation about how much such a move *might* cost them. It would be irresponsible not to, considering that the firm told its investors that its user base in the U.S. declined slightly in the third and fourth quarters, and that declining engagement of users is an investment risk. xe2x80x9cA number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline,xe2x80x9d Facebookxe2x80x99s 2020 annual report warned, xe2x80x9cin some cases precipitously.xe2x80x9dFacebook has substantial market power, so I doubt theyxe2x80x99d lose users if they did take a more aggressive line on moderation. But that said, itxe2x80x99s a paranoid company with an obsessive desire to retain user engagement. And they probably figured, why take the risk?For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Speaking of Facebook, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion today in Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, a case that challenged the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. xc2xa7 227. If you donxe2x80x99t like robocalls and robotexts, this April Foolxe2x80x99s joke is on you. Because Facebook won, itxe2x80x99s open season on your cellphone now. The ripples from this wonxe2x80x99t just open the spigot on unlimited robotexts. Now anyone can legally robocall your cellphone hundreds or thousands of times a day, and no law can stop them.You think you canxe2x80x99t answer a call now from an unknown number without talking to a third-world scammer trying to sell you an auto warranty or a scam lender you never heard of who calls herself \"Rachel\" and offers to refinance your credit card? Just see what happens now that Facebook has won. All hell will break loose on your cellphone all day every day. Anyone could legally robocall or robotext your cellphone hundreds of times a day and no one can stop them. You can thank Facebook for this outrage. You can also thank the gutless, corporate-captured U.S. Congress. They couldxe2x80x99ve fixed this problem last year when they were debating the TRACED Act, originally called the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act. (As if there are any good robocalls?) While considering that bill, New Jersey Congressman Frank Pallone wanted to add two sentences to the TCPA to clarify that predictive dialers, the kind of calling system that all scofflaw telemarketers use today, which dial numbers from a database, are \"automatic telephone dialing systems\" under 47 U.S.C. xc2xa7 227 and thus illegal. But Pallonexe2x80x99s bill went to a committee to synchronize the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill, and lobbyists for the banking industry killed his fix of the TCPA. You can see Pallone's proposed fix to the autodialer definition xe2x80x93 the one that the bank lobbyists killed xe2x80x93 at the PDF linked below, page 2, section 2(a)(1): xe2x80x9cThe term xe2x80x98robocallxe2x80x99 means a call made (including a text message sent)....xe2x80x9d thttps://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/PALLONE_0.pdfIt was the easiest fix imaginable xe2x80x93 a couple of new sentences to the text of the statute for 47 U.S.C. xc2xa7 227. The problem that Palonexe2x80x99s language would have fixed is that the imprecise definition of an illegal ATDS in 47 U.S.C. xc2xa7 227 has not been updated since 1991, when telephone technology was simpler. This has caused endless problems and a circuit split in the federal courts that led to the Supreme Court hearing Facebook v. Duiguid. Here's the problem: In 1991, autodialers only worked by dialing phone numbers sequentially or randomly. Today, no one uses a sequential or random autodialer. Instead, every telemarketer worth his or her offshore salt uses a xe2x80x9cpredictive dialerxe2x80x9d into which they load thousands, tens of thousands, or millions of phone numbers and then pulls them into the dialer to call them: dialing from a database. The 1991 language that legally defines an autodialer xe2x80x93 sequentially or randomly xe2x80x93 doesnxe2x80x99t describe predictive dialers, so after today's SCOTUS decision, theyxe2x80x99re legal everywhere, even if they make millions of unwanted calls a day. So you can thank our gutless Congress for that.You can also thank the Washington State Democratic Central Committee. Last May, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a challenge to the TCPA in Barr v. American Association of Political Consultants, brought by the Washington State Democratic Central Committee, a Tea Party political action committee, and three other political groups who think itxe2x80x99s just terrible that they canxe2x80x99t flood your cellphone during campaign season with text messages.Itxe2x80x99s a xe2x80x9cfree speechxe2x80x9d issue, they said. I always thought free speech was when you set up a soap box in your local park or its print or online equivalent and had your say about some issue that bugs you. The American Association of Political Consultants apparently think free speech is setting up a soapbox on your cellphone to invade the privacy of your kitchen, living room, bedroom, or bathroom at any hour of the day or night. You can thank them, too.Just remember, the U.S. Supreme Court decided as it did today because the banksters want to call tens of thousands of people like you per hour with autodialers, and Big Tech and every politician in this country want to send unlimited text messages to your cellphone. Even Berniexe2x80x99s people send text messages unbidden to your phone.Worst of all, this is not an outlier decision by the Supreme Court. Itxe2x80x99s a strict constructionistxe2x80x99s dream decision. Our gutless Congress left them no choice, given the statutory text that Congress couldxe2x80x99ve easily fixed last year or at any time in the last 20 years.If you want to be a Duguider, write your congressperson and senator and tell them to fix the law by adding congressman Pallonexe2x80x99s easy fix to the TCPA. Otherwise, get ready to be robocalled and robotexted all day, every day.No posts","title":"Facebook Made Up to $2.9 billion from QAnon in 2020 - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/facebook-made-up-to-29-billion-from"}

Ixe2x80x99m going to write about why they didnxe2x80x99t, the damage that decision caused, and why Biden will forge a different path.  Also short pieces on:How Gmail Quietly Controls a Vital Channel for Political SpeechThe Slow Collapse of Corporate RepublicansThe Monopoly Behind the Nuclear Weapons LobbyThe Coming Merger BoomWhy Golf Clubs Are Getting WorseBefore the main event, some house-keeping. I have a piece in the New York Times on the Arizona state legislative fight against the app store monopolies of Google and Apple. Also, I was recently on Marketplace to talk about Google. Finally, reporter Alec McGillis has an important book out on Amazon and the tearing apart of American society. Itxe2x80x99s called Fulfillment: Winning and Losing in One-Click America, and Ixe2x80x99ll be writing more about it shortly.And nowxe2x80xa6Americans expect Google to deliver the most relevant and best results for any particular query. But Google has an edge case problem. When an unsophisticated or desperate user really needs information about something important, and marketers are trying to lie or defraud the user, Google may deliver results that are not only bad, but actively harmful.For instance, in 2017, reporters Cat Ferguson and Dave Dayen showed that Googlexe2x80x99s poor search results had become a useful tool for con artists trying to entice addicts and alcoholics to sham rehab facilities. Googlexe2x80x99s marketing tools often worked, helping shoddy treatment center firms cheat addicts, some of whom no doubt relapsed. Offering poor quality rehab facilities is wrong, and Google didnxe2x80x99t cheat the addicts directly. But what made this line of business profitable was among other things the easy access to customers enabled by using Google. Indeed, as Ferguson noted, these companies were xe2x80x9cunited by their dependence on Google.xe2x80x9d Embarrassed by the publicity, Google eventually made some effort at addressing the problem, but never really figured out how to stop con artists from using its service to harm these desperate people.Similarly, in 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported on millions of fake listings on Google Maps, which con artists used to cheat customers and blackmail honest small businesses. Users were screwed. But for businesses, the only recourse was to spend more ad money on Google; complaining got you nowhere, or worse. Said one businessman, xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s less harmful to piss off the government than piss off Google. The government will hit me with a fine. But if Google suspends my listings, Ixe2x80x99m out of a job. Google could make me homeless.xe2x80x9dIn other words, while generally speaking you will get good results from Google, in edge cases you may get results that are extremely harmful, like a repairman who cheats you, a bad doctor, or someone who wants to steal your money in the guise of helping you recover from addiction. Since most people expect to get credible results from Google, itxe2x80x99s a form of mass deception. And those who rely on Google to convey information to customers, like small businesses, are often on a knifexe2x80x99s edge, existing at the whim of a search monopolist that does not notice them. These quality problems are a result of Googlexe2x80x99s monopoly; poor quality is a classic symptom of monopoly power. How Google seems to offer good results on the whole, but sometimes undermines quality at the edges, is a somewhat subtle story. Googlexe2x80x99s main search engine is what is called a xe2x80x98general search engine,xe2x80x99 meaning it provides general results based on indexing most of the web. There are other types of search engines. Yelp and Expedia, for instance, are known as xe2x80x98vertical search enginesxe2x80x99 who focus on a much narrower topic, like local businesses and travel. You canxe2x80x99t ask Yelp generalized questions about research or culture, but it is likely better (though not perfect) at removing local restaurant listing spam than Google, because that is its entire business. Of course Google isnxe2x80x99t just a general search engine. It has vertical search lines of business as well. It competes with Yelp, Expedia, etc, listing restaurants, health providers, travel information, etc, and has user reviews. But the incentives are different for Google. If Google Maps stopped listing every restaurant in New York City, the lost revenue literally wouldnxe2x80x99t show up on Googlexe2x80x99s income statement. Yelp, however, would see it as a crisis for its business. The CEO of Yelp no doubt spends a lot more time thinking about removing fake listings of restaurants than Google CEO Sundar Pichai, just because Pichai has nine products with more than a billion users. Maybe Google is better at building stuff than most companies, but itxe2x80x99s not so much better that its executives can spend no time on a search problem and, all things being equal, still outperform a specialized search vertical. In other words, the reason Google isnxe2x80x99t very good at finding the right health care provider or local business is because thatxe2x80x99s not really what its executives think about. All of this is a way of saying that vertical search engines are sometimes better at finding certain kinds of information than Google. In its original form, from 1998-2007, Google helped blend the world of general and specialized search; it simply chose the best results, sending people to the right place on the web or to the right vertical search engines that had the best results. As Google co-founder Larry Page once put it, xe2x80x9cWe want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible.xe2x80x9d People built businesses around an open web. Yelp was founded in 2004, back when you could still found firms adjacent to Google; Yelp got a lot of traffic from Google because it had the best local results. But in 2007, Google stopped trying to send users to the most relevant place to answer their query, and started to try and keep people on Google properties. It began transforming itself from a general search engine into a walled garden, and it arranged its business strategy to exclude competitors, both vertical and general search, from the market, especially as people started to use their mobile phones to find things. At first this change was subtle, but Google gradually expanded its walled garden, encompassing more and more content. In doing so, it directed ad revenue to itself, eventually strangling not only vertical search competitors, but also publishers, online video and mapping competitors, and advertising technology firms.Today, Google is the key gatekeeper to the web for users and advertisers, and venture capitalists will not invest in firms adjacent to it. Googlexe2x80x99s dominance is also why the web in 2021 is increasingly a mess, a place for scam artists and disinformation. Today, if there were a vibrant competitive market for search, this rehab clinic fiasco might not be a problem; a health-based vertical search engine might be able to solve the problem that Google cannot. But in Googlexe2x80x99s walled garden internet, thatxe2x80x99s no longer a possibility. And as there really is no distinction between the web and the offline world, Googlexe2x80x99s absentee landlord relationship to problems involving credible information is one reason scam artists and disinformation are proliferating globally.It didnxe2x80x99t have to be this way. And in fact, in 2012, the Federal Trade Commission, which is our antitrust enforcer, nearly filed a case that would have stopped Google from corrupting our information commons.And this brings me to Leah Nylenxe2x80x99s story last week titled xe2x80x9cHow Washington Fumbled the Futurexe2x80x9d, looking back on the Obama administrationxe2x80x99s policy vis-a-vis Google. She got her hands on a series of allegations the FTC had in 2012, in documents kept secret for nearly a decade. Recently, there have been multiple antitrust suits launched against Google, two by states and one at the Federal level. What is astonishing is how the FTC in 2012 had the evidence to bring most of the suits in court today. Those of us who follow this area didnxe2x80x99t think that the 2012 FTC documents would be that interesting. The vote to close the Google investigation was unanimous, 5-0, with both Republican and Democratic commissioners letting Google skate. We figured that the FTC just didnxe2x80x99t see the problem clearly, as technology markets tend to morph quickly. Back in 2011 when the investigation started, who would have imagined that Google would become this powerful and dominant?And yet, it turns out that the FTC had evidence of Googlexe2x80x99s behavior, and just chose not to act. Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman called these released documents a xe2x80x9csmoking gunxe2x80x9d showing how xe2x80x9cGoogle methodically destroyed the web.xe2x80x9d Stoppelman competes with Google, but other more neutral observers agree with him. William Kovacic, a Republican ex-FTC member, said, xe2x80x9cI always assumed the staff memo was not so specific, direct and clear about the path ahead. A lot of the DOJ case is in there. Itxe2x80x99s really breathtaking.xe2x80x9d Kovacic, who voted to open an investigation in 2011, left the FTC before the complaint came up for a vote, so he hadnxe2x80x99t read it until this week.These documents revealed many things, one of which was a battle inside the institution. The FTCxe2x80x99s lawyers, while meek, were evidence-based, and did want to bring charges. The FTC economists, by contrast, fought them every step of the way, with predictions that today - and frankly even then - were jaw-dropping in their wrongness and stupidity.So what were the allegations?The FTCxe2x80x99s lawyers made two observations about Google. First, Google intentionally harmed and killed vertical search rivals by putting its own product first, which is known as xe2x80x98self-preferencing.xe2x80x99 xe2x80x9cGoogle,xe2x80x9d said the complaint, xe2x80x9croutinely, and prominently, displays its own vertical properties, while simultaneously demoting properties that are identical to its own, but for the fact that the latter are competing vertical websites.xe2x80x9d Google also would scape from its rivals and present their user-generated content as its own. Second, Google used exclusivity agreements and its own market power to deprive its rivals of user traffic, advertising revenue, data, and advertisers. In doing so, Google drained the vitality out of the web, so much so that venture capitalists began using the term xe2x80x98kill zonexe2x80x99 to describe the un-investable spaces adjacent to Google.If there was such strong evidence, what happened?There were three main reasons for the reluctance to bring a case. The first is simple: corruption. Google was extremely close with the Obama administration, with its lobbyists averaging a meeting a week at the White House. Today, four out of the five FTC Commissioners who voted on the case, as well as staffers involved like Howard Shelanski, receives money directly or indirectly from one of the five big tech giants. (The only former FTC Commissioner who voted on the case and does not receive big tech money is deceased.) Even more tellingly, the resolution of the case happened a little over a month after the reelection of President Obama, a campaign in which then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt was on election night, as The Wall Street Journal reported, xe2x80x9cpersonally overseeing a voter-turnout software system for Mr. Obama.xe2x80x9d Today this sounds bad, but at the time, the attitude in the White House was that Google, Facebook, and Amazon were making the world a better place. Republicans loved them because the GOP loves business, and Democrats loved them because they were culturally progressive and good for consumers. (For example, in 2013, well-known Democratic pundit Matt Yglesias wrote about Amazon, xe2x80x9cAmazon, as far as I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.xe2x80x9d)The second main reason was ideological. Even the FTC lawyers were under the spell of the xe2x80x98consumer welfarexe2x80x99 standard, and felt that Google had the right to monopolize as long as consumers werenxe2x80x99t harmed. The reason, for instance, that the lawyers didnxe2x80x99t want to bring a charge for Googlexe2x80x99s self-preferencing to kill vertical search engines wasnxe2x80x99t that they didnxe2x80x99t know the goal. They realized it was a scheme to monopolize. But they felt that Google had presented enough evidence showing that consumers might like it if Googlexe2x80x99s search engine prioritized Googlexe2x80x99s own properties. This ideology made the lawyers meeker, though they still wanted to bring suit.The third and most significant reason is that the commissionxe2x80x99s antitrust economists made a very strong, and entirely wrong, argument against the case, which in retrospect rested on a set of laughably inaccurate predictions. While the FTC lawyers at the Bureau of Competition wanted to bring some charges, the economists at the Bureau of Economics said there was no case. They believed the online ad and search markets were competitive, consumers were benefitting, and there was little evidence of misbehavior. Here were some of the assumptions and predictions from the Bureau of Economics in 2012.Consumers will continue to rely on desktop computers to search, not smartphones or tabletsSurveillance advertising tracking users across the web have only a xe2x80x9climited potential for growthxe2x80x9d    Google is not a monopoly Search engine quality isnxe2x80x99t primarily driven by data (xe2x80x9cThe premise that more click data is the primary and critical determinant of competitive position and qualityxe2x80xa6 is contrary to the history of the general search market.xe2x80x9d)Google was not a particularly significant source of traffic for vertical search engines like YelpGoogle choosing to downgrade more relevant content in favor of its own content is good for consumers    Defaults donxe2x80x99t matter to consumersSome of these assumptions are wrong, but a few are downright crazy. Take the assertion that that search engine quality isnxe2x80x99t primarily driven by data, which is what FTC economists argued. That notion was contradicted by testimony the FTC got from Google official Udi Manber. Manber told the FTC, xe2x80x9cThe bottom line is this. If Microsoft had the same traffic we have their quality will improve *significantly*, and if we had the same traffic they have, ours will drop significantly. That's a fact.\" And who was Manber? He was Googlexe2x80x99s former chief of search quality. The importance of data is not a controversial assumption. Itxe2x80x99s just one that FTC economists chose to disbelieve. Most of the other assumptions were similarly outlandish. Why did these economists, who are well-trained and smart, rely on such silly assumptions? Itxe2x80x99s not as simple as financial corruption, though that plays a role. Itxe2x80x99s that antitrust economics, writ broadly, has nothing to do with understanding markets or monopoly power. At the same time, for instance, as FTC economists were dismissing the idea of Google as a monopoly, the economists at the other antitrust enforcement agency, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, were being similarly ridiculous in justifying why they didnxe2x80x99t bring a single case against a monopolist.Carl Shapiro, the head economist at DOJ, argued that there just werenxe2x80x99t any monopolies to go after. Ixe2x80x99m not kidding. Herexe2x80x99s a direct quote.First, I can say from personal experience that when I was the chief economist at the DOJ during 2009-2011, the Antitrust Division was genuinely interested in developing meritorious Section 2 cases, and we were prepared to devote the resources necessary to investigate complaints and other leads, but we found precious few cases that warranted an enforcement action based on the facts and the case law.Itxe2x80x99s not just that money from dominant firms offered to the antitrust economics world is endemic; Shapiro, for instance, is now a consultant for Google. Itxe2x80x99s that antitrust economics is designed purely as a language for excluding ordinary people from debates over political economy. If it were designed around some sort of scientific validity, the FTC Bureau of Economics failure over Google would be understood as so egregious that it would justify firing much of the economic staff. But that didnxe2x80x99t happen, in fact what happened is nearly ten more years of aggressive self-congratulations. During the Trump era, the only part of the FTC to receive boosts in funding were the economists.Thatxe2x80x99s how deep-rooted the problem is.So is Biden going to break with Obama on antitrust? The short is yes. The only question is how aggressively he does so. Back in October, I did a bunch of interviews with people around Biden-world for a piece on how a President Biden would take on corporate power. I noted that Obama loved Silicon Valley, even musing that after he left office he might become a venture capitalist, while Biden by contrast called big tech CEOs \"little creeps.\" Obama adored technocrats, but Biden himself when he was in the Senate had little patience for economists. Mostly Ixe2x80x99m pretty happy with my predictions, in which I said Biden would spend a lot of money and be more populist than Obama. But Biden has out-performed my expectations. He hired antitrust expert Tim Wu for the White House, and is reportedly appointing antitrust expert Lina Khan to the FTC. And Biden himself when he was in the Senate had little patience for economists. Meanwhile, Republicans, who were just as in thrall to Google, have changed as well. Trump brought a Google antitrust suit, the conversation on Capitol Hill has undergone a stark change on the right, and the awesome Texas case against Google is heavy on evidence of monopoly power and very light on theoretical economics.So both parties have broken from the antitrust status quo. That said, the question now is whether political leaders writ large can ditch their affection for economists. These debates are more than theoretical. When someone uses Google to find help for their addiction, that person is not accessing a search engine, but a manipulation machine designed to serve the interests of whoever pays Google the most. It didnxe2x80x99t have to be this way. And if we downgrade economics, it doesnxe2x80x99t have to be this way anymore.How Gmail Quietly Controls a Vital Channel for Political Speech: One point of frustration for newsletter writers is that Gmail shifts certain email that people have requested into the Promotion tab, and sticks ads that look like emails on top of the Promotions list to get Gmail users to click on more ads. A contact told me about how this practice hits political organizers and political leaders particularly hard, and is now causing a crisis in political communications. Politicians and organizers are randomly are blocked from communicating with volunteers and small dollar donors.xe2x80x9cPeople have spent the last 5 years fretting about the role Facebook might play in augmenting election results xe2x80x94 but Gmail can completely subvert an candidatexe2x80x99s electoral chances and has gotten minimal scrutiny.xe2x80x9dThe Political Collapse of Corporate Republicans: Last week, the House Antitrust Subcommittee had a hearing on suggested changes to the antitrust laws, part of a series of hearings that will likely result in a significant overhaul in how the state and corporate power relate to one another. The hearing illustrated the problems that the GOP coalition is having meshing its increasingly anti-monopolist conservative base with its big tech supportive corporate wing. This tension became evident watching Republican FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips get grilled, not so much by Democrats, but by Republicans.An increasingly significant concern for the right is big tech firms using their power to censor conservatives, as they did when they removed Donald Trump from most major platforms after the Capitol Hill riot. Conservative Republican leader Jim Jordan, who is the highest ranking member on the full Judiciary Committee, is extremely deferential to corporate power, but he is first and foremost a conservative movement leader. So on the one hand, he generally wants to help promote his vision of a free market, but on the other, he cannot abide dominant firms censoring his political faction. In this hearing, he was seeking some sort of reconciliation of these two goals, and asked his Republican ally, Noah Phillips, for help.Phillips is a corporate Republican, and in this case, he simply had nothing to offer. In a back and forth, he told Jordan that censorship was not a monopoly concern. He also gave no ground on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives a liability shield to tech platforms, and is often offered by Republicans as a way to address censorship concerns without making antitrust laws more powerful.Jordan asked, xe2x80x9cIf we're not going to use antitrust to deal with censorship and you are reluctant to talk about Section 230, what's the answer?xe2x80x9dPhillips responded, \"I'm afraid I don't have a good answer.\"Phillips couldnxe2x80x99t respond with anything, because the only way he could have discussed addressing big tech censorship was by acknowledging that the state should be structuring markets deliberately on behalf of some sort of common good. And that concession would crush his ability to fight against state power and on behalf of dominant firms. Jordan needed something Phillips couldnxe2x80x99t offer.Movements donxe2x80x99t end when their ideas prove to be wrong, they end when solving one political problem causes another, bigger one for their coalition. And thatxe2x80x99s why libertarianism is falling apart.A Nuclear Missile Monopoly Lobby: Ixe2x80x99ve written a bit on the Northrop monopoly over the nuclear missile business, the result of a merger between Northrop and rocket engine maker Orbital ATK. As it turns out, monopolist Northrop is a big donor to the group of Senators who support spending more money on these missiles, informally known as the ICBM Coalition.The efforts of the ICBM Coalition have been supplemented by lobbying and campaign contributions from ICBM contractors, led by Northrop Grumman, which has received a sole source, $13.3 billion contract to build a new ICBM, known formally as the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, or GBSD. Current estimates indicate that building and operating the GBSD and related warheads will cost $264 billion over the life of the program, which would provide a steady flow of revenue to Northrop Grumman and associated companies for years to come.A quarter of a trillion dollar sole source contract? Not bad, Northrop.The Coming Merger Boom? With the increasing drumbeat of merger announcements, most recently the $25 billion railroad merger of Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern, itxe2x80x99s clear therexe2x80x99s a merger boom afoot. As AELP analyst Krista Brown noted, xe2x80x9cthe FTC received 1130 preliminary merger filings in the last 4 months. That is nearly double the 683 filings received in the same time period last year... The distressed market is causing a merger boom that will only continue to grow in the coming months.xe2x80x9d Stay tuned.Thanks for reading.

BIG reader Ross Baird emailed me the following.Matt-I play golf as the occasional hobby, I like being outside and walking for hours. I bought a club about 20 years ago, an Adams Tight Lies 3 Wood, that I have hit for 20 years and loved. My club unfortunately recently broke (it was durable and lasted 20 years!) and I went shopping for a replacement. Not to get too in the weeds, but the design and style of Adams golf clubs was definitely superior - it was a small startup golf club success that hit the big time. Unfortunately I could not find a golf club like the one I bought 20 years go, today's version of Adams Tight Lies 3 wood is definitely inferior to the version 20 years ago and super expensive ($300+!) So i figured there's a monopoly story here. Adams Golf was started in Plano, TX and went super successful off the back of the Tight Lies Club, which was definitely better than any other product. Yet in 2012 Adams was acquired by multinational conglomerate Adidas, which turned Adams clubs into carbon copies of the other (inferior) brands they owned (corporate efficiency!). In 2017, after the roll up merger failed, Adidas sold off Adams and a couple of other brands to private equity firm KPS partners.So I should not have been surprised that 20 years ago I bought a product that is clearly superior to the same product today, after a monopolistic merger and private equity spin-off, even though the latter is more expensive.Monopolies everywhere!For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I think Yglesias' take there was always somewhat tongue-in-cheek.  If you read the rest of the post you linked, he adds, \"Itxe2x80x99s also the most terrifying competitor in the world. My main point is simply that the key here is Bezosxe2x80x99 relatioship with shareholders. Lots of companies would, Ixe2x80x99m sure, love to delight their customers by slashing prices to a zero-margin level. The problem is most companies would worry that plummeting profit margins would lead to fired executives and mass layoffs of rank-and-file employees. But Bezos has the confidence of the investment community and earns a staggering P/E ratio for his company.\"Though in some ways perhaps this is _more_ damning -- the possibility of Amazon devouring the market and becoming a monopolist was always visible, and the fact that this was a primrose path to perdition should've been made more explicit in commentary, not downplayed in favor of looking at the temporary upside.Matt, have you considered the value and benefit of TAXING AD PLACEMENTS and TAXING THE RUNNING OF ADS as a strategy to reduce the glut of useless, destructive ads ruining the psychic commons?  I understand this is a congress-level issue.  However if we don't talk about taxing ads, we never get there.  The furthest I got in my visioning on this is CRITERIA:  Which ads would you tax?  Which ones would you not want to tax?  Which ads would you wish to tax into oblivion?  My best fantasy on this so far is to have an un-elected, appointed board of criteria setters who have the power to tax ads and how much.  Just empaneling such a criteria board would draw fire away from the taxes themself, a good thing.  Plenty of challenges with such an idea:  diversity?  Cancel culture?  Attacking ad culture directly thru taxation would create a huge media frenzy.  Use this as in akido to get people talking about what a healthy psychic commons could be.    If you make who's on the board and who's not the center of media attention, the more basic activity of taxing ads detrimental to the psychic commons can proceed with less push-back.  Let all the media attention be on personalities.  Any taxing of ads, at any rate, starts creating a new norm of considering the public good.  Similar to the Robin Hood tax on all stock trades.No posts","title":"How Economists Corrupted the Internet - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-biden-can-clean-up-obamas-big"}

I donxe2x80x99t disagree with it but I donxe2x80x99t understand how this article lead to that final thought and would like to understand it better.Libertarians do have a problem dealing with monopoly and oligopoly. They will claim that all such cases arise from government intervention and protection, and in many cases, they are right or at least partly right. But it's not whole picture by any means.As for the conservative movement, there was an attempt in the early 80s to eliminate all antitrust enforcement as redundant. Even many conservatives were uncomfortable with this, because people back then remembered why antitrust arose in the first place. So the criteria were narrowed to consumer welfare alone, and antitrust was saved, in a truncated form. After all, one of the biggest antitrust cases of the last century was the AT&T breakup, which happened under Reagan. Conservatives saw that as having a clear consumer benefit, and so it did.Consumer benefit as a criterion is fine, but in retrospect, it was clearly too narrow, which is why Matt is writing his pieces here. There was the Microsoft case of the first Clinton term, but that was the last major antitrust case until very recently. The big collapse of antitrust happened under, not Reagan, contrary to myth, but under Clinton, specifically in his second term, when the alliance of the Democratic leadership and Wall Street solidified. It remained there all the way through the end of Obama's second term.Even after the haze of neoliberal globalization, any decent economics text will have a chapter on the classic monopoly characteristics and how monopolies seriously distort not only markets, but society and politics as well. They are price makers, not price takers; they respond to average cost, not marginal cost; they restrict output at higher prices than the market-clearing situation; if monopsonists of labor as well, they hire less labor at a lower wage than the market-clearing situation; and finally, they end up throttling innovation and develop undue political and social influence. Conservatives see the last item and (some like George Gilder and Peter Thiel) see the second-to-last clearly.But it's the whole picture that needs to be seen to fully assess the reality. We might say that no side has a monopoly on the truth here :)No posts","title":"Noah Phillips and the Political Collapse of Corporate Republicans - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/noah-phillips-and-the-political-collapse"}

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here.Everyone who gets email issues of BIG gets them because they have voluntarily signed up to receive information. We have a nice community of readers going, and I learn a lot from you. And yet, on occasion, when I sent out an issue of BIG, it doesnxe2x80x99t reach Gmail users. I find this frustrating, but itxe2x80x99s actually a much bigger and more serious problem than just a few newsletter not getting delivered. A reader reached out to me after I tweeted about the problem, and described how it impacts political organizing and the ability of political leaders to communicate with voters.Gmail created differentiated tabs (inbox, social, promotions, etc) in 2013 ostensibly, as with nearly every consumer-facing change Google makes, in furtherance of improving user experience. But Gmail also uses these tabs as an opportunity to serve ads to email users: Cluttering the main inbox would maybe bleed away users, but they feel more acceptable in these quasi-commercial tabs. The promotions tab is particularly interesting, because a lot of stuff you actively sign up for and expect to have show up in your normal inbox sometimes lands there xe2x80x94 newsletters, info from small business, emails from nonprofits or candidates, etc. From a business standpoint it's in Gmailxe2x80x99s interest for the promotions tab to include the most xe2x80x9cinbox-yxe2x80x9d stuff that Gmail can get away with pushing into it, to keep it relevant so that people will open the promotions tab and see the ads there. These ads basically look like emails, and show up right at the top of your email in the relevant tab.But a big problem with this, from the perspective of the person or entity doing the emailing, is that getting stuck in the promotions tab means people are way less likely to see your email. Determining when content gets steered into these tabs seems to be based on really opaque algorithms, which themselves likely change xe2x80x94 and any given change might itself be a function of a second-order algorithm, or engineer-compelled changes. No way for us to know! But if you send emails to a subscription list you can get a good sense that some  change is impacting you by observing open rates xe2x80x94 sometimes they just fall off of a cliff with no warning. The Markup has studied Gmail algorithms and found that open rates for many activist group emails in Gmail plummeted over the course of a few months in 2018 because they were shifted into the promotions tab. Gmail has a huge market share xe2x80x94 by some counts a majority in the US xe2x80x94 so this kind of thing can undercut a political organizing program or even cause an existential crisis for a group that raises a lot of small donations through email. The Markup then considered an obvious, perhaps even more worrisome, implication of this: Political campaigns are ever-more reliant on online tools to get out their messages, raise money, and recruit volunteers. But the inscrutable Gmail algorithm, and inscrutable changes to it, can drastically impact candidatesxe2x80x99 abilities to do these things. People have spent the last 5 years fretting about the role Facebook might play in augmenting election results xe2x80x94 but Gmail can completely subvert an candidatexe2x80x99s electoral chances and has gotten minimal scrutiny. A certain subset of entities has extra profound incentives to buy Gmail ads in the promotions tab: precisely those emailers who used to land in the inbox but now suffer from way lower open rates because they just got jammed into the promotions tab!

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6Today Ixe2x80x99m going to write about how we should break up Disney, the massive media conglomerate that dominates the film and entertainment business. This is a sort of sequel to my essay a few months ago on Netflix, titled the Slow Death of Hollywood.First, I apologize for not sending out any issues of BIG last week, I was in Germany giving a keynote for the social democrats on big tech at their conference on #DigitalCapitalism. What I learned is that as confused as we Americans are about concentrated corporate power, the Germans are just as confused. And the themes I wrote about in Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy are global. At any rate, below is a picture of Karl Marx wearing an Oculus VR headset.Two more excerpts are out from Goliath. The first is in Fast Company and is on the 1990 suit against Microsoft:How Reagan, Clinton, and Bill Gates paved the way for the rise of Big Tech. The second is in Foreign Policy magazine, and is about how New Dealers broke the American corporate links to the Nazis. Itxe2x80x99s titled Beating Wall Street Won World War II.And nowxe2x80xa6Imperial DisneyI love movies and TV shows. As a kid, I bonded with my Dad over Mel Brooks and today I use memes from Step Brothers in presentations. Most people in America love movies. Children dress up as fictional superheroes and princesses, couples fall in love to romantic comedies, and we tell ourselves who we are as a culture based on the stories we absorb.But I didnxe2x80x99t quite get the political importance of film until I worked in Congress. In 2009, as I was learning how Congress funds government programs, the U.S. Marshals service took me on a field trip showing me how a specific program requiring expensive equipment worked. U.S. Marshals are a bunch of government officials who serve outstanding arrest warrants. Like many of the policing and military service branches, they try to increase their budget by impressing young male Congressional staffers, often by showing them the cool toys taxpayer money funds. So I got taken on a rather depressing tour showing how the U.S. Marshals work with local law enforcement to arrest people, and essentially got cooperation from local law enforcement by buying them decked out police SUVs and expensive sledgehammers and whatnot. I asked my guide when they got funding for the program they were showing off, and he told me it was in the mid-1990s. To which I said, why then? And he responded, \"That was when the movie The Fugitive came out, so thatxe2x80x99s when Congress finally understood what we do.xe2x80x9dItxe2x80x99s easy to mock Congress for being ignorant about government, but thatxe2x80x99s unfair. Government is massively complex, and stories help all of us - including policymakers - make sense of the world. They help us understand our values, provoke debate, and teach us our history. So Ixe2x80x99ve watched with growing trepidation as Hollywood, the center of American entertainment, has come under the thumb of a narrower and narrower group of corporations. While I spend a lot of time thinking about big tech, in particular Facebook and Google, the creation and distribution of great American art - movies and TV shows - is increasingly dominated by Disney.This isnxe2x80x99t because Disneyxe2x80x99s animation studio just got really really good and put out new popular movies about Mickey Mouse. In fact, it doesnxe2x80x99t have much to do with Disneyxe2x80x99s ability to make movies or run theme parks at all. Disney is a fundamentally different corporation than it was 15 years ago.Over the last thirty years Disney has become a financialized corporation, a shell of what it used to be. The old Disney had problems, rapaciously protecting its copyrights with a powerful lobbying operation and sometimes mistreating its workers. But its executives and employees also obsessively focused on delighting generations of children. This began changing, slightly, in the 1980s, when then-CEO Michael Eisner realized he could radically improve profitability simply by raising tickets at theme parks. Eisner also kicked off an acquisition spree, buying the ABC TV network, which included ESPN. But Disney's recent status as what one journalist calls xe2x80x9cImperial Disneyxe2x80x9d is really the brainchild of Eisnerxe2x80x99s successor, CEO Bob Iger, who in his 15 years at the helm of the company bought Pixar, Lucasfilm, BAMTech, Marvel, and large parts of 21th Century Fox, as well spearheaded the corporationxe2x80x99s massive expansion into China. Disney now makes a good chunk of must-have content these days, running every major franchise from Star Wars to Avengers to Toy Story. Disney is a global powerhouse; Shanghai Disneyland (which Iger oversaw) was one of the largest investments in the corporationxe2x80x99s history, taking $6 billion and eighteen years to build; it is eleven times larger than Disneyland itself. The corporation is heavily engaged in politics, with former United States Trade Representative Michael Froman, the man who built Obamaxe2x80x99s Wall Street friendly cabinet, serving on the board.As Ixe2x80x99ll show, the new Disney is more a private equity group than studio, collecting brands and using them to bargain aggressively with partners, suppliers and consumers. Imperial Disney is the result not of animation genius but mergers and acquisitions genius. It is not a corporation that pushes the bounds of artistic and technological possibility but a corporation that pushes the bounds of legal possibility under the radical pro-consolidation framework that has existed since the 1990s, as well as the Clinton-era xe2x80x98engagementxe2x80x99 framework that encouraged deep integration of American multi-nationals into China.And we should all be very, very worried about the consequences of this new Disney.Bob Igerxe2x80x99s Monopoly of a LifetimeThis weekend, I sat down and read Igerxe2x80x99s book, The Ride of a Lifetime, because Iger more than anyone else transformed Disney into the global player that it is today. When Iger became CEO of Disney in 2005, he set three goals. First, Disney would acquire and create as much high quality content as possible. As he put it, xe2x80x9cGreat brands would become even more powerful tools for guiding consumer behavior.xe2x80x9d Second, Disney would become a technology company, because xe2x80x9cmodern distribution would be an essential means of maintaining brand relevance.xe2x80x9d And three, Disney would become a truly global company, with its target of penetrating China.That was fifteen years ago. Igerxe2x80x99s goal was basically to turn Disney into a vertically integrated global monopolist over entertainment, instead of the house of Mickey. He sought power, and was willing to jettison the old Disney culture to get it. One of the interesting nuggets that Iger discloses is how everyone at Disney used to be obsessed with, well, Disney. The former CEO Michael Eisner almost always wore Disney ties with figures like Mickey Mouse on them, and most top executives enjoyed Disney gear, or at least pretended to love it. Iger writes in a chortling tone how he, having come from the ABC sports division, escaped this particular tacky way of dressing. Itxe2x80x99s a small hint, that Iger disrespected the culture in a way his predecessors did not.So has Iger succeeded in acquiring massive amounts of power? The short answer is yes. To answer that more fully, I want to draw attention to some truly wonderful reporting on the entertainment industry by Matt Zoller Seitz, who reported on Disneyxe2x80x99s new policy of refusing to allow first-run theaters to show old Fox movies. Disney has traditionally kept its movies in the vault, with theaters unable to show classic Disney fare. The goal is to create artificial scarcity, keep audiences excited that Disney films are something special. Disney is now applying its policy to its 21st Century Fox back catalogue, which includes classics like Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Zardoz, Alien, Aliens, Say Anything, The Princess Bride, Moulin Rouge, and so forth. (Aliens fans are already upset).This is a huge amount of film removed from circulation. As the American Prospectxe2x80x99s Brett Heinz noted, Disney, because of its acquisitions of Pixar and Fox, now xe2x80x9cowns one in seven of all films to ever receive a Best Picture nod.xe2x80x9d It can and does withhold these films from theaters. One way to recognize monopoly power is when a corporation chooses to withhold output, which is what Disney is doing by sticking its old films into the vault. It shouldnxe2x80x99t be able to do this with its new Fox content, this is likely evidence that the merger was anti-competitive, but since neither Obama nor Trump enforced such laws, symptoms of monopoly power are a validation of Igerxe2x80x99s strategy. So how will this shift impact the market? Who is going to get hurt?This restructuring of the movie market is going to have significant impacts on what we can see in theaters and what filmmakers can create. Well most theaters, after an explosion of mega-plexes in the 1990s due to private equity and lax merger enforcement, are large chains who donxe2x80x99t really show old movies. Because of the size and reach of chains, movie releases are increasingly first week phenomena, and so Marvel and Star Wars type branding dominates over weirder and more interesting fare.But there are still 600 independent fist-run theaters left in the United States, and independent theaters are different than chains. They often screen films to celebrate old movies, or they show documentaries or iconoclastic movies.  Independent theaters are some of the few places indy movie makers can show their films. These are the theaters Disney is now crushing, and whatxe2x80x99s left of independent distribution will likely disappear, leaving an oligopoly of theater chains and giant studios controlling movies.So thatxe2x80x99s one illustration of Disneyxe2x80x99s new market muscle under Iger. But Disneyxe2x80x99s power goes well beyond withholding old films. It has roughly half of all ticket sales, and as Seitz notes, is able to demand coercive terms from theater owners, not just higher fees, but promises to screen Disney films, even ones that are likely to be unpopular. This is a practice known as block booking, where a distributor forces a theater to show movies that are less in demand in return for getting access to must-have content, like say a Star Wars or Marvel movie on opening weekend. Block booking is technically illegal under an old antitrust precedent, but, wellxe2x80xa6With the market power Disney now commands, theater chains canxe2x80x99t say no. As Heinz reported a few weeks ago, when Disney negotiated the rights to show Star Wars: The Last Jedi with movie theaters, it gave the theaters xe2x80x9ca set of top-secret terms that numerous theater owners say are the most onerous they have ever seen,xe2x80x9d including giving Disney xe2x80x9c65% of ticket revenue from the film, a new high for a Hollywood studio,xe2x80x9d and forcing them to xe2x80x9cshow the movie in their largest auditorium for at least four weeks.xe2x80x9dxe2x80x99 If the theater didnxe2x80x99t comply, Disney could impose a 5% tax of box office revenue on top of its already existing 65% share. .Once again, that is power, which was Igerxe2x80x99s true aim. The Disney Plus EndgameYet another way to recognize power is the intentional foregoing of selling your product to customers in order to capture market power elsewhere, or what is known as vertical foreclosure. This is most apparent in the new service Disney is rolling out called Disney Plus, which will bundle all of Disneyxe2x80x99s massive trove of content into a Netflix-like bundle. In some ways, this looks like Igerxe2x80x99s end game in the strategy for global dominance. Disney can produce must-have branded content, force theaters to show all of its branded content, and then leverage that across its global network of theme parks and its dominant streaming service. It is vertically integrated from production lot to the end consumer.Igerxe2x80x99s strategy is to do what Netflix is trying to do, except with more raw power. Netflixxe2x80x99s strategy is to produce so much content and sell it at a loss through subscriptions, in the hopes it can drive its competitors out of business. One it has a large base of subscribers and no competitors, it can then raise prices on its subscribers (as it is doing in the U.S.) and pay its talent less money. Where else are they going to go? Well, it turns out they can go to Disney. But to set up a viable competitive product requires Disney to have a superior streaming service. What makes a streaming service good is the content, and Disney has content in spades. Yet, Disney also sells a lot of content to Netflix, and earns a lot of money doing that. To launch a rival streaming product, Disney must stop selling its content to Netflix. Otherwise Netflix viewers have no reason to watch Disney Plus. In other words, for some time as it gains subscribers, Disney will have to lose money it could otherwise make in order to differentiate its streaming service. Such a move cuts against much industrial organizational economic theory. Theorists posit that corporations like Disney tend not to intentionally lose money just to acquire market power, because foregoing revenue is not, apparently, rational. This theory is nonsense. After all, if Disney is willing to tolerate losses just to drive competitors out of business, then vertical foreclosure is deeply problematic, and perhaps illegal. Whatxe2x80x99s interesting is that our antitrust enforcement is so lax that Iger announced his strategy of knocking out fellow intermediaries to Wall Street, and put it in his autobiography.We were now fully committed to also becoming a distributor of our own content, straight to consumers, without intermediaries. In essence, we were now hastening the disruption of our own businesses, and the short-term losses were going to be significant. (As one example, pulling all of our TV shows and moviesxe2x80x94including Pixar and Marvel and Star Warsxe2x80x94from Netflixxe2x80x99s platform and consolidating them all under our own subscription service would mean sacrificing hundreds of millions of dollars in licensing fees.)Iger goes on to note something even more remarkable, saying about the companyxe2x80x99s new streaming service that xe2x80x9cit would take some time before success would be measured in profits.xe2x80x9d It would instead, he wrote, xe2x80x9cbe measured in subscribers.xe2x80x9d Consider whatxe2x80x99s he really saying, which is that Disney isnxe2x80x99t trying to make a profit. Thatxe2x80x99s crazy. No one can compete with an entertainment powerhouse that sells half the movie tickets in the country, that has overly strong copyright protections, as well unlimited loss-making capacity. Iger goes on:We wanted the service to be accessible to as many people as possible around the world, and we had settled on a price that we estimated would bring in somewhere between sixty and ninety million subscribers in the first five years. When Kevin announced we would be selling it for $6.99 a month, there was an audible gasp in the room. The response from Wall Street went far beyond anything we anticipated. In 2015, our stock dropped like a stone when I talked about disruption. Now it was soaring. The day after our investors conference it jumped 11 percent, to a record high. By the end of the month, it was up nearly 30 percent.The New Studio SystemAnalysts are betting Iger is setting up a new studio system. Disney will lose money in order to generate market power that the corporation can later use, often against consumers. Consumers will get a nice bundle at first, with great content at a low price. But that price will creep up over time, as it has with Netflix. And itxe2x80x99s not just consumers who will find their choices radically constrained. The real target of Igerxe2x80x99s monopolization strategy is suppliers of entertainment product. Put another way, the target is labor.When Disney launches its streaming service Disney Plus to paid subscribers, it will radically change how creators are compensated for their work. Traditionally, TV and filmmakers get paid an upfront amount, and then paid again on the backend through residuals or royalties on sales of movies in the after-market. But now, with Disney+, there will be no after-market; Disney will simply take its content and distribute it directly to subscribers, with no one actually paying directly for TV or movie. Comedy legend Judd Apatow discussed the problem on twitter, noting xe2x80x9cDisney is also beginning to change how much back end profits they will make available to TV talentxe2x80xa6 They are so powerful they can just redefine how much everyone gets paid in success to their benefit.xe2x80x9d The new arrangement in Hollywood looks increasingly like the pre-1948 studio system, where creators are signed to single studios, who have power and control over their careers and creative output.Iger has so far succeeded in his strategy. But what are the costs of this strategy to Hollywood and the economy?The Breakdown of CapitalismOne of the most important consequences is that Disney is simply getting rid of functional markets. Disney will simply pick and choose content, without guidance from, well, people being willing to pay money for tickets. It will be an uber-Netflix, and will simply give subscribers what it thinks they want, instead of what they choose to pay for. Friedrich Hayekxe2x80x99s great intellectual innovation in economics was about the importance of information and prices in markets. Through open and competitive markets, the price system, he argued, carries information across millions of people who buy and sell things to each other, serving as a coordinating body that lets producers know what to produce and consumers know what is available inexpensively. It is decentralized and works through free exchange and liberty, but also is remarkably efficient (as long as there are no monopolies and regulations ensure power asymmetries among those engaging in exchange arenxe2x80x99t severe.)In entertainment, this price system works via consumers being willing to pay money to see a movie, or to watch ads to see a TV show. These reflect a market transaction. A consumer is giving up money or time to pay for something, which indicates he or she things that something is a quality product. Aftermarkets where syndications and film rights are traded help quantify what creators are worth, and that enables creators to have bargaining leverage when they want to do something weird, controversial, or interesting. Such markets enabled strange movies like Back to the Future or shows like Seinfeld or All in the Family to get made, because they empower creators and audiences.A subscription service based on monopoly power breaks this entire process. Netflix, for instance, pretends to have fancy algorithms to determine quality, but itxe2x80x99s not clear that they have figured out a good quality filter superior to the price system. Central planning in movies and TV shows doesnxe2x80x99t deliver as much as decentralized production and distribution, for the simple reason that a centralized system is less likely to let as much weird stuff through. Disney is likely to lose its filmmaking edge; indeed, it is already so large and has so many brands that the bad remake of films like The Lion King do suggest a loss of creativity. Such a loss will not matter to Disney the corporation, because to will have distributive power to compensate, but it will matter to all of us who love movies, and those who make them, and to the societies all over the world who use film and art to make sense of the world.Yet another consequence of Disney Plus is that it will erode the basic foundations of capitalism. in his book, Iger notes he had to find ways to compensate Disney division heads with arbitrary metrics to get them to put their stuff on Disney Plus, and this was hard, because they were used to hitting revenue targets. The division heads have a point. Capitalism is premised on selling final goods for more than it costs for the initial inputs, otherwise you are destroying wealth. By selling below cost, which is what Disney may be doing, the corporation is reducing aggregate wealth to acquire market power. Itxe2x80x99s simply impossible to compete with someone who is willing to gain revenue by paying a dollar for fifty cents. Disney may or may not be doing that with its low Disney Plus price, but the fact that Disney Plus makes it impossible to measure value coming out of each division shows that the breakdown of the price system and potential below cost pricing is likely eroding value.Disney and ChinaTherexe2x80x99s one last serious problem, and that is Chinaxe2x80x99s increasing use of Western corporations to censor Americans. We saw this with the NBA, but Disney is clearly the biggest villain here. The U.S. government wrote about this problem in 2015, it has only gotten worse. Herexe2x80x99s Iger, on the recent Hong Kong protests and the NBA.The biggest learning from that is that caution is imperative. To take a position that could harm our company in some form would be a big mistake. I just donxe2x80x99t believe itxe2x80x99s something we should engage in in a public manner.And yet Disney is not staying neutral, but is taking sides. Chinaxe2x80x99s side. You will never see any criticism of China in a Disney movie or entertainment property, and ESPN is using Chinese propaganda in portraying the geopolitics of southeast Asia. What this means is that monopoly power for Disney is monopoly power for the Chinese government. And the more assets Disney acquires, the more leverage for China.What Is to Be Done?I donxe2x80x99t have a fully thought out way of breaking up Disney yet. I am working through how to address this market power, which is simply overwhelming. It will likely require vertical and horizontal restrictions, and addressing problems with the abuse of copyright protections to leverage additional market power. The nice thing is that wexe2x80x99ve dealt with similar problems in the past, and succeeded. And Ixe2x80x99m pretty confident that we can do so again. After all, imperial Disney is less than 15 years old. The public policy underpinning Disneyxe2x80x99s consolidation of power isnxe2x80x99t a permanent state of being, itxe2x80x99s just a particularly noxious way of regulating our entertainment industry.Thanks for reading.

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6Today Ixe2x80x99m going to write about a very dangerous theme floating around in military and big tech circles, which is that big American tech monopolies are good for national security and should be weaponized and controlled explicitly by the American national security apparatus. The relationship between corporate power and global geopolitics frames the historical debate over antitrust, as I discuss in Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy. (Buy it. Yeah, Ixe2x80x99m not going to be subtle.) The argument has been with us since before World War One, and is with us today. Last week, for instance, Mark Zuckerberg gave a speech on free expression, and yesterday he testified to the House Financial Services Committee on the need for Libra. Both times he implied that Facebook was essential to protect us from China.What is interesting is how certain parts of the national security world may not be so averse to how Zuckerberg thinks, even if they donxe2x80x99t trust him specifically.And so it is back to that debate we must go.Incidentally, I was on CNBC yesterday to talk about Zuckerberg, and explain why I think Libra isnxe2x80x99t going to happen and is a xe2x80x9ccrazy idea.xe2x80x9dAnd nowxe2x80xa6National Security Is the Last Resort of Monopoly Scoundrels In his speech last week and in his testimony yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg put a choice to policymakers. Pick between Facebookxe2x80x99s domination, or Chinaxe2x80x99s. xe2x80x9cWhile we debate these issues,xe2x80x9d he said, xe2x80x9cthe rest of the world isnxe2x80x99t waiting.xe2x80x9d He explained this was particularly the case with his new currency Libra. xe2x80x9cChina is moving quicklyxe2x80x9d on its digital currency, and while Libra could xe2x80x9cextend Americaxe2x80x99s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world,xe2x80x9d that would only be the case if regulators allowed such innovation. The threat of Chinese dominance was implied.As part of his narrative, Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of democratic values embedded in the American platform of Facebook. Itxe2x80x99s easy to be skeptical of his framework, considering that Zuckerberg was so eager to get into China that he apparently asked Xi Jinping to name his child, blurbed a book of Xi Jinpingxe2x80x99s speeches, and made his employees read Chinese propaganda. In June, when Facebook announced Libra, political leaders and regulators gave it a giant thumbs down. In July, during the first set of hearings, Facebook was embarrassed. Zuckerberg wasnxe2x80x99t persuasive yesterday either; political leaders were deeply skeptical, because Zuckerberg has been deceptive about his view of China as late as last week.Less important than Libra is the overall xe2x80x9cnational championxe2x80x9d argument that Zuckerberg is making. Proponents of national champions believe big is powerful, and that national power is a function of the scale that a nationxe2x80x99s corporations can bring to bear on world markets and security regimes. In many ways, Zuckerberg is the worst possible messenger for this theory. There are in fact much better proponents, like former intelligence and DOD official Jon Bateman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Yesterday, Bateman penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on the strategic importance of big tech. xe2x80x9cDespite their faults, tech companies contribute directly to American military and intelligence operations,xe2x80x9d he wrote. xe2x80x9cTheir titanic scale can itself be an asset.xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99ve spoken with multiple important political leaders who believe this. Itxe2x80x99s a seductive view, one based on the idea that wise technocrats need large amounts of centralized power to keep our systems stable and our society under control. Bateman also argued, interestingly, that big tech, by working with China and enabling bad behavior domestically, also weakens national security. He tries to thread a path, by essentially proposing a national security veto over antitrust cases against national champion-style big tech companies.Wexe2x80x99ve seen this argument before. The idea of  what is called a xe2x80x98national championxe2x80x99 was and is a foundational element of big business conservatism and state socialism, and has been for over a hundred years. Teddy Roosevelt, who is mistakenly understood as a great trustbuster instead of the supporter of monopolies he was, used this quote in 1912 in his call to repeal the antitrust laws, that if we xe2x80x9cdo not allow cooperation, we shall be defeated in the world's markets.xe2x80x9d It is what the monopolists at Alcoa (and their allies in the military) thought before World War II when they argued their engineering system of aluminum fabrication was a marvel of ingenuity that could not and should not have competition. It is what Secretary of War Henry Stimson believed during that war when he managed to tamp down antitrust cases against domestic monopolists. And the frame, though discredited, continued after the war. In the late 1960s, U.S. large banks like National City (Citibank) argued that they needed to get our from under regulatory restrictions so they could promote American values globally. In the 1970s national security officials freaked out about Japanxe2x80x99s state sponsored planning for its technology giants, and hated that antitrust enforcers sued AT&T and IBM. How dare we go after the metaphorical Yankees of technology?!? Under Reagan, the Pentagon tried to stop Bill Baxter from breaking up AT&T. And yet there arenxe2x80x99t cases when antitrust action undermined collective security. The antitrust suit against Alcoa helped build a massive aluminum industry and the xe2x80x9carsenal of democracyxe2x80x9d against the Axis. And the suits against IBM and AT&T resulted in the explosion of innovation in the 1980s and 1990s which happened in the U.S. and not Japan. But since we decided to forego our heritage, itxe2x80x99s time to rebut this veneration of bigness, yet again. The Case Against AntitrustBateman makes two basic arguments against antitrust action. First, economies of scale are necessary for modern technology. Cloud computing for instance requires large amounts of investment, and breaking up the cloud giants like Microsoft or Amazon would jeopardize this technology. Second, economies of scale preserve American market share and thus national security reach; smaller companies are just less competitive. It would undermine the xe2x80x98network effectsxe2x80x9d so critical to big tech success.  Batemanxe2x80x99s arguments are basically what big tech leaders think as well. Zuckerberg talks about the resources he has to fund national priorities, and Brad Smith of Microsoft in his book Tools and Weapons basically proposed a fusion of big tech and the state for the same reasons.So letxe2x80x99s take them on.Economies of ScaleHerexe2x80x99s Bateman:Consider cloud computing. The Defense Department is planning a massive global cloud called JEDI. Unlike corporate clouds, the xe2x80x9cwar cloudxe2x80x9d must support life-or-death missions on austere battlefields despite virtual or physical onslaughtsxe2x80xa6Vast resources were needed to fund global networks of hardened data centers linked by undersea cables. The U.S. militaryxe2x80x99s unique demands required companies of unique scale. Yet one JEDI bidder faces a concerted breakup campaign (Amazon), and the other was nearly dissolved in 2001 (Microsoft).There are many problems with this argument, the main one being that it doesnxe2x80x99t reflect the real experience of actual operations. The National Security Agency has its own government cloud. Years ago, the CIA went to Amazon for its cloud computing needs; reading between the lines, this article suggests the experience of being forced into dependency on AWS was problematic. The CIA is now trying to move to a multi-provider cloud. In general, while itxe2x80x99s true that economies of scale exist, they are almost always overrated.More fundamentally, Bateman conflates technical economies of scale with financial conglomeration. There's no reason AWS has to be part of Amazon or Azure part of Microsoft. What does book selling have to do with cloud computing? Nothing. In fact, therexe2x80x99s a fairly good argument AWS is less successful than it otherwise would be because itxe2x80x99s part of Amazon instead of an independent business.  Therexe2x80x99s also the very obvious problem of dependencies; Bezos is highly dependent on China through his retail arm, which gives China leverage over his cloud business. There are some elements of Amazon or Microsoft that should technically stay together, but these companies are largely giant conglomerates whose divisions have no actual relationship with one another beyond a common hierarchy, legal status, and branding. Financial links are not technical links, but Bateman doesnxe2x80x99t distinguish between easily severable legal relationships and cemented together software-linked data centers.Global Competitiveness and Big TechBateman also offers this argument.Splitting up Big Tech would reduce its intelligence value. First, smaller companies would lose global market share to foreign rivals such as Alibaba or Baidu, which can ignore FISA. Small U.S. sites canxe2x80x99t leverage the xe2x80x9cnetwork effect,xe2x80x9d a gravitational force that helps large sites stay dominant. Intelligence collected from small sites would also be less useful. They see only narrow slices of online activity, whereas tech giants track users across sprawling internet ecosystems. Dismantling these ecosystems would put greater burden on intelligence agencies to xe2x80x9cconnect the dotsxe2x80x9d of potential threats.This argument that big tech would lose market share if it were split up is 100% backwards. We venerate engineers in garages because that's where good ideas come from, not from entrenched interests. Google and Facebook are less competitive because they are big, not more competitive. That's why TikTok is gaining, because Facebook hasn't improved its product in five years and it has killed all attempts at investment in social media.Bateman also mischaracterizes network effects. A network effect is what happens when an additional user of a network adds value to a network in a geometric curve. A phone network with only one user has no value (no connections), with two users it has value because those two can call each other (one connection), three users can call each other (six connections), and so on and so forth. But Bateman gets the dynamics of network effects and big tech wrong. There is a network effect for Instagram and one for Facebook, but there isn't one for the Facebook-Instagram financial conglomerate. And again, network effects are also a result of political choices, not just physical ones; wexe2x80x99ve allowed Facebook to keep its network closed, but force AT&T to let Verizon phones connect in. Even the individual network effects are a function of a failure to organize interoperability mandates.Bateman thinks that because Google and Facebook are big and powerful now, they will be innovative going forward. The opposite is likely true. They are like GM and Ford in the 1960s, doing extremely well because of market power and scoffing at foreign competition that destroyed them just a few years later. Or perhaps they are like Boeing in 2018, a company that passed $100B in revenue for the first time ever. It was on top of the world. Today, it isxe2x80xa6 not.(And thatxe2x80x99s just the commercial side of the argument. Without going into too much detail, letxe2x80x99s just say Ixe2x80x99m deeply skeptical that more surveillance capacity means better intelligence. I suspect that more intelligent intelligence means better intelligence.)A National Security Veto for Antitrust Over Big Tech?Bateman isnxe2x80x99t just boosting big tech, he also brings some skepticism to the table. He writes, for instance, that big tech has xe2x80x9cgiven terrorist groups a new way to radicalize recruits and enabled foreign governments to covertly influence the general public. These actors exploit algorithms that make sensational content go viralxe2x80x94a result of decisions by Facebook and YouTube to maximize user engagement.xe2x80x9d These companies have also subverted American interests vis-a-vis China. As Bateman writes, xe2x80x9cxe2x80x98AI and its benefits have no borders,xe2x80x99 as one Google executive put itxe2x80x94do not justify Googlexe2x80x99s establishment of a Chinese research center. Dubious assertions and discredited theories canxe2x80x99t excuse Applexe2x80x99s censorship of Chinese apps.xe2x80x9d This presents a dilemma, in Batemanxe2x80x99s view. Bigness is good but big tech has misused their power. So what is the remedy? His proposal is to incorporate national security officials to advise antitrust enforcers and Congress, especially where break-ups are concerned, as well as to reduce authority for state-level antitrust enforcers. Bateman, in other words, seeks to fuse the power of big tech with the national security apparatus, with the threat of antitrust as a stick for the intelligence world to force Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon to do what they want. Ixe2x80x99ve never liked the outrageous amounts of secrecy in our government, but an explicit veto over how we the people get to structure our markets should terrify all of us. This would engender a murky world of secretive government officials walling off political debate over fundamental questions about technology, commerce, communications and politics behind classified barriers. This framework seems to be, to protect us from China, we must become China.Batemanxe2x80x99s piece is useful because it brings the debate into the open. The argument isnxe2x80x99t just bad because it proposes ideas that would undermine who we are as a people. Fundamentally, Bateman doesn't get why America is successful at technology. We aren't good at technology because we concentrate power, but because we do the opposite. We liberate our people to tinker and compete, we don't place them under the rule of secretive autocrats, and we certainly donxe2x80x99t, as fascist systems do, fuse concentrated political and corporate power.I go into this dynamic in Goliath, but itxe2x80x99s increasingly well-understood. As Margaret O'Mara notes in her wonderful book on the history of Silicon Valley, competition and NOT concentration is the origin story of our high tech industries, which were funded for military purposes. The government structured a scientific and educational complex to support military technologies, but did it through open competitive markets. The point is, competition and freedom produces strength. Aristocracy concentrates power in the hands of those who appear strong, but are in fact weak and slothful. Mark Zuckerberg may have $70 billion, but with all that wealth, despite his mediocre speeches about free speech, he hasnxe2x80x99t created anything useful in years. Because at the end of the day, hexe2x80x99s just trying to find ways of sticking more ads in front of our Facebook feeds, and thatxe2x80x99s not going to protect us from anything, let alone the determined strategists who organize the Chinese state.Thanks for reading.

He didnxe2x80x99t quite get crushed, because there is now no majority to form a government, but his career is on the ropes. While it wasnxe2x80x99t entirely framed this way in foreign coverage, corruption exposed by anti-monopolists was a key driver of the political outcome. Netanyahu had a strategy to ward off the charges of corruption. He sought to use a Trump endorsement and aggressive anti-Arab rhetoric to change the subject, in an attempt to fend off a centrist challenge. Or that was the plan. So far, it hasnxe2x80x99t worked. And herexe2x80x99s why.The Israel Anti-Monopoly MovementIn 2011, Israelis poured onto the streets in massive protests, partially inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movements sweeping over the rest of the world, like those in Tahrir Square in Egypt and the Indignatos in Spain. (Occupy Wall Street came after the Israeli protests, but is the most well-branded of that global protest wave). The last time I was in Israel was 25 years ago. I just got returned a few months ago; it is a very different country than the one I remember. Economically, the biggest difference is that the country is rich. There are skyscrapers in Tel Aviv, which there werenxe2x80x99t in the 1990s. Tech headquarters from multi-nationals like Microsoft dot the landscape. I ran into multiple businessmen from companies like Samsung and Intel, as well as venture capitalists bringing in Chinese tech investment. The economy is divided into two segments. There is the tech sector, which created companies like Waze, and is largely driven by engineers who come out of the military (half of Israelis serve in the military). Israeli tech companies compete globally, and the countryxe2x80x99s tech sector ranks among the most highly sophisticated engineering and scientific communities in the world. Then there is the rest of the economy, which is that of a small nation-state strangled with monopoly distributors controlling everything from packaged goods to automobile imports. Israelxe2x80x99s prices are quite high, and a small number of politically connected people are getting very rich off those high prices.In 2011, Israelis en masse built one of the largest protest movements the country had ever seen, pouring into the streets for sustained protests over political corruption and the high cost of living in the country. It was one of the first times security was not the core political issue, and rumors at the time were that the protests were ginned up by the oligarchs, who owned most of the Israeli press, to go after Netanyahu. As the protest continued, however, something strange happened. The tenor of the protesters changed. A business newspaper called The Marker, started by legendary Israeli financial journalist Guy Rolnik, reported on the reason for the high cost of living. The problem, he argued, was that the non-export economy was controlled by a small group of oligarchs, each of whom owned a bank around which was a satellite of companies placed into holding companies. Rolnik was inspired by Louis Brandeisxe2x80x99s 1913 book Other Peoplexe2x80x99s Money: The Bankers and How They Use It, which described the same problem in the U.S. a hundred years ago.Rolnikxe2x80x99s media coverage helped reshape the protests. After the first month on the streets, a new argument emerged among protesters, who started going after the oligarchs themselves. These days, the handful of wealthy families who dominate the Israeli economy are assuming a new role: one of the chief targets of the tent-city protesters who have shaken Israel in the past month.The xe2x80x9ctycoons,xe2x80x9d as they are known even in Hebrew, are suddenly facing enraged scrutiny as middle-class families complain that a country once viewed as an example of intimate equality today has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor in the industrialized worldxe2x80xa6Those families xe2x80x94 the Ofers, the Dankners, the Tshuvas, the Fishmans and others xe2x80x94 account for the 10 biggest business groups in the country and together control some 30 percent of the economy. They will doubtless be among the targets at another set of street demonstrations planned for Saturday night.Some specialized in construction, others in media, telecommunications or natural gas. These oligarchs were accompanied by a network of public relations companies and corporate law firms, each of whom ringed and protected the oligarchs. Enter Benjamin xe2x80x9cBibixe2x80x9d Netanyahu.Bibixe2x80x99s IsraelWhen the Occupy-style protest in 2011 started, Netanyahu had been prime minister for two years. Having grown up partially in Philadelphia, Netanyahu is a brilliant and Machiavellian leader, a former Boston Consulting Group employee who understands right-wing American populist politics and the business structures and power of concentrated finance. His political genius lies in importing American right-wing political strategies to Israel, innovating on top of them to make them more outlandish, and winning elections. Starting in 2009, he firmly wedded Israeli politics not just to American government, but to the Republican Party.Netanyahu had been the leader of Israel in the 1990s, and had been involved in a host of economic choices in the early 2000s to deregulate different industrial sectors. But despite his important career, like Trump, the Israeli establishment jeered at him as a clown and a demagogue, good at whipping up anti-Arab sentiment and a dangerous actor, but not a man worthy of respect. When the people rose up in protest, Netanyahu was both afraid, and spied an opportunity. At first, the protesters were whipped up and encouraged by the press as a curiosity, as a large group of people upset with the government. Soon, however, protesters began attacking oligarchs, and something weird happened - the media coverage changed. As the New York Times reported, xe2x80x9cA television journalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter, said his station would probably not do a program on wealth concentration to avoid upsetting the stationxe2x80x99s owners.xe2x80x9dDespite Netanyahuxe2x80x99s right-wing leanings, he had reasons of his own to dislike the media monopolists.  xe2x80x9cBut many of the moguls are somewhat to Mr. Netanyahuxe2x80x99s left on foreign policy,xe2x80x9d wrote the Times. xe2x80x9cAnd their newspapers can be merciless on him. Other newspapers accuse the prime minister of being in bed with the rich.xe2x80x9d Netanyahuxe2x80x99s perspective wasnxe2x80x99t crazy; in 1995, the Israeli Antitrust Authority declared the main newspaper in Israel,  Yedioth Achronoth, a monopoly. This newspaper is controlled by the secretive media baron of Israel, a man named Arnon xe2x80x9cNonixe2x80x9d Mozes, and served as a protection racket for the other tycoons.  Mozes was able to port this newspaper to the web, and his website is read by roughly 25% of Israelis every day. And Mozes had been fairly vicious towards Netanyahu.Faced with mass protest on the one hand over the cost of living and jeering oligarchs on the other, the far-right wing Netanyahu decided to side with the protesters. This was a remarkable change in Israeli politics. For decades, Israeli politics focused on the problem of security, but in the background, the tycoons manipulated the politicians for their own ends. Netanyahu flipped the script, he had the government attacking the tycoons.Netanyahu taking a committee he had created in 2010 but that had laid dormant, a committee with important Israeli thinkers that had the capacity to research the Israeli monopoly problem. It was massively prestigious; for example, Israeli-American and later Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer was on it. Anti-monopolists demanded this committee act, and it did. Netanayhu then went after the Israeli telecom sector, introducing competition into the telephone and data markets. Consumer prices dropped by 90%, and Israel went from one of the most expensive telecom markets in the world to one of the least expensive. In 2013, the Knesset passed the Anti-Concentration Law, formally titled xe2x80x9cA Law for Promotion of Competition and Reduction of Concentration,xe2x80x9d which was passed by every party in the Knesset with no objections.This law eliminated the heavily-indebted pyramid companies that had allowed a small number of families to control the Israeli economy. It also restructured the banking system, establishing a separation between banking and commerce. The anti-monopolist went further, sending several of the tycoons to jail. In 2018, the Israeli government sentenced one of the richest men in Israel - Nochi Dankner - to a three year sentence. Dankner had been revered, and owned a telecom company, a broadband provider, a giant supermarket chain, and a cement monopoly. When these laws kicked into effect, it turns out his empire was a house of cards, and he went bankrupt. Then the government put him on trial for stock manipulation.Years later, the anti-monopoly movement coalesced into institutions. Movement leaders formed crowd-funded advocacy groups, such as the well-respected Lobby 99, so named after the Occupy Wall Street xe2x80x9cwe are the 99%xe2x80x9d slogan. Then, two years ago, Netanyahu reversed course. He backed away from the anti-monopolists, and began to cast them as left-wing rabble rousers. This strategy shift was part of a deal he was trying to cut with Mozes. He and Netanyahu hated each other, but Netanyahu realized that Mozes could be useful to his ambitions. So the two cut a deal; Netanyahu would help eliminate competition in media against Mozes, and Mozes would keep Netanyahu in power for as long as Netanyahu wanted.This change in strategy was another massively important shift in Israeli politics. Instead of tycoons controlling politicians, or the government going after tycoons, the new recipe Netanyahu was trying to put in place was the Prime Minister controlling the country through the tycoons.But this dynamic hasnxe2x80x99t quite worked. Mozes and Netanyahu were bitter enemies, and so they didnxe2x80x99t trust each other. Netanyahu had the conversation recorded by an assistant. And what do you know? His assistant was caught for unrelated scandals, and the police found the recordings.According to a report Sunday in the daily Haaretz, officers are in possession of xe2x80x9ca seriesxe2x80x9d of audio recordings of Netanyahu that appear to corroborate the suspicions, part of a mysterious investigation whose details have remained hazy.Channel 2 reported that Ari Harow, Netanyahuxe2x80x99s former chief of staff, recorded the conversations between Netanyahu and Mozes, at the prime ministerxe2x80x99s request. The recordings were found by police at Harowxe2x80x99s home.The evidence, the reports said, doesnxe2x80x99t necessarily point at financial favors, but rather indicates an attempt to forge a xe2x80x9cquid pro quo pactxe2x80x9d under which the unnamed businessman would help Netanyahu shore up his leadership, and receive xe2x80x9cachievements estimated to be worth a fortunexe2x80x9d in return.Rolnikxe2x80x99s The Marker has been exposing these rotten deals by Netanyahu, and Netanyahu is also being investigated for taking favors in office.  Netanyahuxe2x80x99s arguments about why he recorded the meeting with Mozes were themselves remarkable, something out of House of Cards. He claimed that he was being extorted by Mozes, xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m under constant extortion with this man. He stabs, stabs, stabs.xe2x80x9d Netanyahu claimed that he recorded the meeting as insurance, to prevent Mozes from once again xe2x80x9cruling the state.xe2x80x9dThis sordid episode reflects the raw power arrangements underlying Israeli politics. And the damage, to both Netanyahu and Mozes, is significant.Corruption and Israeli ElectionsOver the past six months, elections in Israel for Netanyahu have become more than just a question of political success or failure. If he was not able to retain power, he would likely to be indicted on corruption charges. And if he could retain power, he would have to get the Knesset to grant him immunity, which will cause a national crisis if the Supreme Court and the Knesset clash.Netanyahuxe2x80x99s political strategy to deal with corruption during the election has been to foment more autocratic anti-Arab rhetoric, seeking to maintain his power through a coalition of right-wing settlers and ultra-religious Orthodox. He used Trump-like strategies, including statements about fake news, to deny reports of corruption.It didnxe2x80x99t quite work, though it didnxe2x80x99t quite fail. In recent elections, Netanyahu did not perform as he needed to, but the opposing parties didnxe2x80x99t win either. No one has a majority, and the swing vote rests in the hands of both Arab parties and a right-wing secular politician opposed to both the Palestinians and the ultra-Orthodox. So far, Netanyahu has not been able to form a government, and the opposition, led by a man named xe2x80x8eBenny Gantz, will now try. Netanyahu has been the dominant presence in Israeli politics for over ten years, and his prestige was heavily damaged by the results. He is no longer perceived as invincible. Israel may now have to go forward to a third election, and Netanyahu may actually be unable to avoid a trial.So there we go. One of the more influential right-wing leaders in the world, a man obsessed with power, had his dark secrets exposed. And those secrets run straight through the murky world of monopoly tycoons.This is a very weird story, and it shows how the power of concentrated corporate structures just cannot be separated from larger cultural and political trends. The people involved in every area of politics at the top are the same. At any rate, if Israelis, in one of the most complex geo-political situations in the world, can address their oligarchs, then people everywhere can do it too.Thanks for reading.

I got this note from a BIG reader in China.As an American who is living in economic exile in China, I really appreciate what you are writing about China.  For the last few years, I have had conversations like this with friends back home, who didnxe2x80x99t fully seem to understand how dangerous China is.I wanted to share with you a personal anecdote about just how good the Chinese propaganda machine is.A couple of years ago, when I lived in Beijing, a friend and I were out very late at a bar.  We start chatting in English with a young Chinese woman, and Taiwan comes up.  -My friend, is an American guy who speaks fluent Mandarin and knows Chinese history like it is the back of his hand.-.  We tell her that most of the Western world is not really behind China on the whole Taiwan thing, is she started crying.  Like legit, full on tears.  My friend is able to prove to her that he really knows Chinese history as well, so we arenxe2x80x99t just a couple of no-nothing white guys (China is filled with 0 to hero foreigners).  She was genuinely shocked, that the world isnxe2x80x99t 100% behind China on Taiwan, that there is another side to this issue.Many Chinese people take their national identity personally in a way I canxe2x80x99t really understand.  It has created a population of people who have both a victim complex and a superiority complex. Many perceive an attack on China to be a personal attack on them.  I really appreciate what you are writing.  China is the number 1 issue in the world today.  As China sells its surveillance tech to other non-Democratic states, the threat only increases.  One of the key ways of fighting China, is to heal our liberal democracy.  Live up to our values.  For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"How Israeli Anti-Monopolists Helped Take Down Netanyahu - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-israeli-anti-monopolists-helped"}

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6For those of you near D.C., I will be at Politics and Prose today at 7pm to do a book talk on Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy. More information is here. Todayxe2x80x99s issue will be about the Democratic debate, in which antitrust played a prominent role. Part of the story is that the Democrats are strengthening their own views on monopoly, and I trace the parallel to how Democrats operated in the late 19th and early 20th century, when they effectively demanded that the DOJ send John D. Rockefeller to jail, and did actually indict his brother William.In the meantime, I had my own debate over monopoly versus automation on MSNBC yesterday with MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle and political pundit Jason Johnson. Sparks fly!The Crisis of CapitalismItxe2x80x99s fairly obvious something is deeply wrong with our economy, a crisis of capitalism. There are many theories, but my basic view is that the problem is that monopolists have taken over everywhere. Therexe2x80x99s concentration in big markets, everything from search and social networking to airlines and cable. Therexe2x80x99s concentration in smaller markets, like peanut butter, syringes, bank software, and comic book distribution. Monopolization increases inequality and wage stagnation, reduces entrepreneurship, causes regional inequality, and corrupts our politics and corporations.The Democratic Party is responding by getting more aggressive against monopoly power. In the Democratic debate in June, Democrats spent a few minutes on big tech and monopoly. This time, they did it again, with a twist. The moderators started by asking about Andrew Yangxe2x80x99s argument that automation, not monopoly power, is what matters.  Pete Buttigieg has made this case as well, saying that automation, not offshoring via trading structures, led to job losses in the 2000s. The counter-narrative is that problems in our economy are due not to trends that have existed since the 1700s, but to the central question of power. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, and Cory Booker all took this side, arguing that monopolization in the business world is the key issue at hand. All of the major figures in the party, with the exception of Joe Biden, increasingly see our central economic challenge this way. Robert Bork came up twice in the debate, and Bork, while featuring prominently as a Supreme Court nominee, was an antitrust lawyer first and foremost.Even Biden is sympathetic to antitrust. Biden himself is more driven by the environment around him, not any hard and fast principles, and he would like to rhetorically go after big tech and concentrations of corporate power if only because it sounds good. It doesnxe2x80x99t hurt that some of his main backers are from Comcast, and they hate Google. Hexe2x80x99s reluctant, though, because one of his main advisors on antitrust, Terrell McSweeney, was on the Obama Federal Trade Commission, and she bears some responsibility for the lax antitrust record of the Democrats in that era. For example, while at the FTC, she supported a regulatory attack on the city of Seattle for trying to increase wages for Uber drivers. As it turns out, McSweeneyxe2x80x99s view is causing tension on the Biden team. Nancy Scola of Politico writes as much, in a coded way, saying the topic is a xe2x80x9clive issuexe2x80x9d inside the campaign. But itxe2x80x99s what Ixe2x80x99ve heard as well from multiple people close to Biden.If you look at how Uber responded to Californiaxe2x80x99s law probably mandating that it treat its drivers as employees, youxe2x80x99ll see why anti-monopolists are gaining strength. Uber general counsel Tony West basically responded to the California government with, xe2x80x98nahh, wexe2x80x99re not going to comply.xe2x80x99 And then threatened to spend $60 million on a popular referendum to overturn the law if California tries to enforce it. I wrote about this dynamic for Wired yesterday in a piece called Corporate America's Second War With the Rule of Law. As usual, wexe2x80x99ve been here before, this was the situation in the roaring 1920s.There were bitter battles in the 1930s, because the rule of law is a political value that must be won. And in fact, going back through history, I found that the Democratic Party, for a hundred years until the Clinton administration, tried to do just that, particularly focused on the problem of monopolies. The party consistently got stronger on the problem of monopoly over time. From 1880-1988, there was something on antitrust or monopolies in the Democratic Platform. Herexe2x80x99s the Democratic platform in 1880.xe2x80x9cFree ships and a living chance for American commerce on the seas, and on the land no discrimination in favor of transportation lines, corporations, or monopolies.xe2x80x9dThe language got more aggressive as farmers, merchants, and workers organized against railroads on the one hand, and as corporations became more powerful on the other. In 1900, in the midst of the first great merger wave that created modern corporate America, the platform said xe2x80x9cprivate monopolies are indefensible and intolerablexe2x80x9d and were xe2x80x9crobbingxe2x80x9d the people and small businessmen. As problems in the corporate world got worse,  Democrats became even more assertive. Think Democratic attacks on the FTC for its weak $5 billion settlement for Facebook was aggressive? When the antitrust division under Taft broke up Standard Oil and American Tobacco, Democrats in 1912 said this was a pittance, demanding that enforcers effectively send John D. Rockefeller to jail.We condemn the action of the Republican administration in compromising with the Standard Oil Company and the tobacco trust and its failure to invoke the criminal provisions of the anti-trust law against the officers of those corporations after the court had declared that from the undisputed facts in the record they had violated the criminal provisions of the law.When Democrats took power later that year, they acted. In 1912-1913, Congressman Arsxc3xa8ne Pujo led the first great Congressional investigation into corporate power, the xe2x80x98money trustxe2x80x99 hearings. When Woodrow Wilson became President, the DOJ started indictments. In the case of the J.P. Morgan dominated transportation conglomerate The New Haven Railroad, which was sort of the Uber of its day, the antitrust division indicted the *entire board of directors,* which included such luminaries as William Rockefeller and Theodore Vail, the President of AT&T. Wilson also broke up AT&T for the first time, established the Federal Trade Commission to stop anti-competitive practices, and appointed Louis Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916. Democrats were on the cusp of a New Deal, a genuine attack on monopolists. Unfortunately, World War One interrupted, delaying the restructuring of the American political order for another twenty years.Today wexe2x80x99re in a similar situation as we were in the early 1900s, on the cusp of a major policy revolution. The wind is blowing strongly. From 1992-2012, antitrust didnxe2x80x99t warrant a mention in the Democratic platform (thank you Bill Clinton!) And then, in 2016, because of the new anti-monopoly movement, Democrats finally put something into their platform again. I was actually part of the group who worked to insert a provision; we tried to get something about big tech and data in there, but the Clinton campaign, which did inch towards antitrust, wouldnxe2x80x99t go that far.  They wanted to focus on airlines and cable, the rumor was Sheryl Sandberg would be in Clintonxe2x80x99s cabinet.By the 2020 debates, it is now axiomatic that we have to address the crisis of big tech. And the leading Democrat, Elizabeth Warren, wants to do that with a series of break-ups. In fact, she put that idea out there in March, and it has since become a normalized idea across the enforcement community. The right question isnxe2x80x99t whether what Warren suggested is too aggressive. The right question is when break-ups will become the moderate option. In fact, I wouldnxe2x80x99t be surprised to hear calls for jail time for some of the richest men in the country. The Sherman Act, after all, is a criminal statute.Thanks for reading.

Here's a snippet about sloth and waste from one corner of the world, the electric utility industry.As tech companies march towards monopoly, one could think of utilities as \"postcards from the future.\" One of the common threads between utilities and large corporations in \"competitive\" markets is that management becomes more concerned with the avoidance of bad press than with delivering high-quality products. This principle is showcased perfectly in information technology (IT) contracting. Some major utilities (whose names I will withhold to avoid retaliation) spent north of $100M on a shitty database and web portal for one state's electric market. Utility managers hired IBM for this piece of work -- not because IBM's IT consulting is worth a damn, but because \"no one ever got fired for hiring IBM.\" Later, to my horror, I got this utility to admit in sworn testimony that they hired IBM without a defined scope of work....Naturally, costs skyrocketed -- but who cares? The utility's laziness led to windfalls for IBM and some random management consultant. The project was a disaster, but a few years later, IBM's contract was renewed without any competitive bidding. This taught me that monopolies trade price and quality for decreased liability.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"When Democrats Used to Indict Plutocrats and Monopolists - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/when-democrats-used-to-indict-plutocrats"}

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6Todayxe2x80x99s issue is written by two government procurement experts (and readers of BIG). One is an anonymous currently practicing government contracting officer who has been doing acquisitions for ten years. The other is Lane Becker, who was formerly with the Technology Transformation Services at GSA, where he started and ran the 10x investment program (https://10x.gsa.gov). Before that Lane started a couple of companies in Silicon Valley. These folks are really smart, you are in for a treat.Their piece is on innovation and war in the 19th century and today, which as it turns out, are conceptually the same. What do the Confederacy, Union procurement, and Chinese development of their air force have in common? More than you thinkxe2x80xa6But first, my book is out today! Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy. Buy it, read it, and tell me what you think. The first excerpt is out in the American Prospect on one of the great villains of American history, Andrew Mellon.For those of you near D.C., I will be at Politics and Prose this Thursday at 7pm to do a book talk. More information is here.And nowxe2x80xa6U.S. Procurement Won the Civil War, It Would Lose A War to ChinaIf it wasnxe2x80x99t for a single unorthodox approach to contracting by the U.S. Navy in early 1861, the Confederate States of America would very likely have won the Civil War. The story of how the Union kept Washington from falling into the hands of the Confederates by buying smarter is illuminating xe2x80x94 as is the reason that such a purchase would be almost impossible to make in the United States today, given the level of dysfunction in our present-day defense contracting system.At the beginning of the Civil War, the Union was able to successfully establish a naval blockade because the Southern states had few ships of their own. A blockade was critical to prevent cotton from flowing to Europe, allowing the South to strengthen its financial, military, and foreign policy position. But the Unionxe2x80x99s blockade was tenuous. The U.S. Navy at the time was, according to the assessment of U.S. naval secretary Gideon Welles, xe2x80x9cfeeble, and in no condition for belligerent operations. Most of the vessels in commission were on foreign service; only three or four, and they were of inferior class, were available for active duty.xe2x80x9d The Confederacyxe2x80x99s naval secretary, Stephen Mallory, sought to take advantage of the Unionxe2x80x99s naval weakness, and crafted a superior fighting ship to defeat the Union on the water. When the South took the Gosport Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, in April of 1861, the confederates salvaged the hull of the U.S.S. Merrimack, and Mallory ordered his men to rebuild the top half of the scuttled wooden ship with iron xe2x80x94 a first for its time. As one historian noted, xe2x80x9cMallory understood that innovation and creativity would be his primary hope in the face of an overwhelming conventional force he could not match.xe2x80x9dUnion spies inside the Confederacy sent a steady stream of information about the building of the xe2x80x9cironcladxe2x80x9d northward.  Union leaders realized that to maintain the blockade, they needed better ships. The Navy issued open advertisements and gave respondents 25 days to submit plans, but, xe2x80x9cstill hanging on to what they knew best,xe2x80x9d the request was laden with requirements that severely limited the range of what could be offered in response while also ensuring the build cost would remain high (a situation that will sound strikingly familiar to anyone involved in government acquisitions today.)The selection board received proposals for 16 designs and settled on two, but, worried that neither would actually float, asked the finalists to provide mathematical evidence of their shipsxe2x80x99 viability. This request stumped the submitter of a design for the U.S.S. Galena, Cornelius Bushnell, until a chance encounter at The Willard Hotel in Washington D.C. with the owner of a major ironworks plant led him to a Swedish born engineer named John Ericsson. Ericsson did the calculations in a night, and then, offhandedly, proceeded to show Bushnell an entirely new design for an ironclad ship he had designed 10 years earlier.Bushnell later said listening to Ericsson talk about building his ironclad xe2x80x9cawoke [him] to the fact that salvation was in store for our Government and country.xe2x80x9d Ericssonxe2x80x99s design had no masts, rigging, or sails whatsoever,  and was much smaller than similar fighting ships, more like a modern day submarine. Most importantly, it was made entirely of iron, not wood with iron plating, which meant it would be able to withstand a significantly greater attack.Bushnell took the model directly to Secretary Welles. Impressed, Welles and Bushnell attempted to convince the more conservative naval officers on the selection board to approve this new design despite its deviations from their list of required features, ultimately enlisting President Lincoln to join them for their presentation.Even with Lincolnxe2x80x99s endorsement, the design was rejected by the board as too radical. Undeterred, Bushnell convinced Ericsson to come to Washington to present to the board himself. After much debate, the board relented and allowed Ericsson to proceed, convinced by the fact that his $275,000 submission was by far the cheapest, and that he could build his ship in 100 days xe2x80x94 the only proposal that would be finished by the time the Merrimackxe2x80x99s conversion into the C.S.S. Virginia would be completed.On March 8th, 1862, the Confederate ironclad left port, headed to the northern side of Hampton Roads, Virginia, where the James River meets the Chesapeake Bay, and where the U.S. Army was stationed at Fortress Monroe with several wooden ships enforcing Lincolnxe2x80x99s blockade. Panic set in. Should the blockade fall, as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton said to Lincoln, xe2x80x9cit was not unlikely we shall have a shell or cannon-ball from one of her guns in the White House before we leave this room.xe2x80x9d Fortunately, Ericsson had finished his ship, the U.S.S. Monitor, two weeks earlier. The crew of the Monitor sailed 51 hours straight to get to Hampton Roads, arriving six hours after the fighting had begun and several Union ships had already been lost. The two ships were evenly matched and battled for several hours, but in the end, the Monitor prevailed, entirely because of Ericssonxe2x80x99s design. The classically ironclad design of the Virginia xe2x80x94 the top half of the old Merrimack now covered in iron plating but the bottom still exposed wood xe2x80x94 meant that, as the battle wore on, the Virginia used up so much ammunition that the ship began to lighten, eventually rising high enough in the water that it was about to expose its wooden underbelly to the all-iron Monitor. The Virginia steamed off before that could happen. The Union had won.It is as true today as it was during the Civil War that bringing new ideas into old institutions is a daunting task. But whereas in 1861 it was difficult for someone like John Ericsson to get his idea for a new kind of ship into the hands of the U.S. Navy xe2x80x94 requiring a combination of talent, connections, persistence, and sheer luck, all very American traits  xe2x80x94 today it would be impossible.Thatxe2x80x99s not to say that similar threats desperately in need of inventive responses donxe2x80x99t exist. Theyxe2x80x99re everywhere, whether itxe2x80x99s the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noting that every major weapons system is riddled with cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could neutralize them entirely, warnings from top level commanders that the military needs to adapt, or experts outright declaring that as things currently stand America will likely lose a war against xe2x80x9cnear-peerxe2x80x9d rivals Russia or China. But wexe2x80x99ve professionalized and obfuscated the practice of government contracting to such a degree that itxe2x80x99s become nearly impossible to penetrate by normal industry, let alone dogged patriots like Ericsson. Eisenhowerxe2x80x99s warnings about the military industrial complex 50 years ago have truly come to fruition.Healthy competition encouraging new entrants and smaller players are critical to the successful development of any new technology. This is especially true for military technology, where historically it has been outsiders who bring the biggest changes, like Patrick Blackett essentially creating modern day operations research during World War II. The ironclad board in 1861 got 16 bids and awarded to three different companies, but that level of competition is unheard of for todayxe2x80x99s major weapons systems, where 67% of major government defense contracts are now awarded to companies without any form of competition. Whatxe2x80x99s even worse is the distribution of these dollars. Big business and big defense go hand in hand. The top ten contractors receive 3 of every 10 dollars spent. Who comprises the remaining companies that get whatxe2x80x99s left? Itxe2x80x99s a club of 50 or so corporations that not only supply the U.S. military but all of its major allies xe2x80x94 a monoculture that leaves very little room for competition or innovation. Itxe2x80x99s dangerously close to a de facto monopoly state.When Bushnell approached Ericsson to help him secure his proposal to the Navy ironclad board, Ericsson did so out of pure intellectual interest and didnxe2x80x99t ask for any kind of remuneration. Bushnell, in turn, put patriotism ahead of capitalism, taking Ericssonxe2x80x99s model and plans and presenting them even though it risked the years of work he had put into his own design of the Galena.This wouldnxe2x80x99t happen today, either. The idea that potential competitors would set aside differences and interests in furtherance of the nationxe2x80x99s interest is laughable. Instead, government contractors are constantly at war with each other, jockeying for oligopolistic advantage via constant lawsuits such as those between xe2x80x9cfourth estatexe2x80x9d firms like Deloitte and Booz-Allen or long, drawn-out protests and charges of rigged bids, as in the saga currently playing out over the DoDxe2x80x99s JEDI cloud contract. The only party that truly loses is the government. The ultimate goal for profit-minded suppliers is not solely a strong fighting force but an addicted one. As CGI xe2x80x94 the company best known for taking the lead in the disastrous rollout of Healthcare.gov xe2x80x94 baldly stated, xe2x80x9cThe ultimate aim is to establish relations so intimate with the client that decoupling becomes almost impossible.xe2x80x9d Relying on suppliers for raw materials, like the Union during the Civil War, is one thing, but when the very nature and strategy behind how we wage war rests largely with private corporations rather than a democratically elected, accountable government it truly is a xe2x80x9cdisastrous rise of misplaced power.xe2x80x9dNothing captures the current predicament more than the F-35 xe2x80x94 the most expensive government acquisition ever undertaken, colloquially known as the xe2x80x9cAir Dominator.xe2x80x9d The parallels to the ironclads of the civil war are striking xe2x80x94 except that, as it stands right now, itxe2x80x99s the Chinese who appear to be on the winning side.The F-35 has been in development since the early 1990s but, weighed down by complicated and onerous management and oversight process, the military is still struggling today to get it to full operational deployment. The cost so far is more than $1 trillion dollars. Compared to the xe2x80x9cironclad batteries of the civil war,xe2x80x9d there were only 4 proposals submitted for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), the formal name for the program resulting in the F-35. Of the four proposals submitted, the government awarded two contracts to Boeing and Lockheed and provided each with $750 million to develop prototypes xe2x80x94 an astounding sum that wasnxe2x80x99t even intended to deliver a final product but instead to ensure the firms wouldnxe2x80x99t bankrupt themselves in order to win the contract.Beyond the F-35xe2x80x99s functional failings xe2x80x94  if they go too fast, they're no longer stealth, when they go slow they can be tracked, and pilots keep passing out from lack of oxygen xe2x80x94 there are two overarching problems with the F-35. First is the fact that itxe2x80x99s basically a xe2x80x9ccomputer that fliesxe2x80x9d, a fact that advocates of the plane proudly promote but one that rightly terrifies anyone familiar with the governmentxe2x80x99s track record on computing. The second and more visible problem is that the Chineses already have their own version. Turns out that when your plane is basically a computer, you donxe2x80x99t have to be physically present to steal it. Back in 2007, the Chinese hacked the US and its allies and took everything they needed to get started. They then modified their version to exploit our significant weaknesses xe2x80x94 not in the F-35 per se, but in what they know about USAFxe2x80x99s ability to wage war. Peter Singer calls this strategy the xe2x80x9cassassinxe2x80x99s macexe2x80x9d approach to defeating a seemingly more powerful, formidable foe. Rather than spend 20 years in protracted, overburdened development, the Chinese leapfrogged us in less than six. And theyxe2x80x99re ruthlessly iterating, helped along by the fact that they donxe2x80x99t care about selling the J-20, unlike the F-35. Their fighter is meant to win a war, not a sales quarter.Because the F-35 is still struggling, the workhorse of the Air Force is the F-22, but overinvestment in the F-35 means that the fleet of F-22xe2x80x99s is falling behind whatxe2x80x99s needed to maintain combat readiness. The USAF currently has 186 F-22 Raptor fighters, of which only 123 can actually fly in combat xe2x80x94 and 22 of those were recently decimated by Hurricane Michael, meaning that overnight the Air Force lost nearly xe2x85x95 of its combat-capable fleet. The parallels between the Civil War and today are hard to miss. We are stationed at Fortress Monroe, our small band of wooden F-22xe2x80x99s manning the blockade as an improved version of a stolen fighter prepares for battle, but this time therexe2x80x99s no Monitor on the horizon to come to the rescue. Meanwhile, the Chinese are about to achieve full production of the J-20. How can we avoid this fate? What will it take to bring the full force of American ingenuity back into our military efforts? To be fair, Congress tries, mandating a new commission every few years to try and figure out how to fix whateverxe2x80x99s going on. The latest iteration of this is the Section 809 Panel, named for Section 809 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the bill that provides the budget and expenditures for the entirety of DoD. Itxe2x80x99s not that the 809 Panelxe2x80x99s recommendations are bad, exactly, and in fact many of them in the three volume set are actually quite good. But theyxe2x80x99re procedural fixes, which are the most frequently tackled element of the overall system. Done well, such changes result in more participants from more diverse backgrounds, who are given fewer resources but are granted greater flexibility to deliver in a significantly shorter timeframe. Parts of the military have had some success making these kinds of fixes. But by itself, these changes arenxe2x80x99t enough; theyxe2x80x99re chipping away at the edges of the problem in the hope that something will spur the radical change thatxe2x80x99s really needed. To truly be effective we need focused, systematic change to the way government funding is distributed via contracts, driven by the military and the executive branch xe2x80x94 to how opportunities are publicized, how theyxe2x80x99re competed (or not), and how we determine who ultimately receives funding. We need to revamp the incentive system that results in ineffective military acquisitions, remove the stagnancy that rules the contracting process, and dismantle the inward-facing oligopoly that has emerged as a result of both. We need innovative contractual structures that reward successful outcomes rather than rigid process, meaningful performance metrics to measure those outcomes, better transparency into whatxe2x80x99s available for bid (check out any page on the legally required FedBizOpps if you want to see the current state of the art), and we need to reward the people who deliver on all of the above instead of the people who actively thwart it.Ultimately, the fix we really need to make all this happen isnxe2x80x99t structural, but philosophical: We need a commitment to a procurement process that not only makes room for the unexpected but actively invites it. It doesnxe2x80x99t need to be xe2x80x94 and shouldnxe2x80x99t be xe2x80x94 easy. It just shouldnxe2x80x99t be this hard.Thanks for reading.

Youxe2x80x99re welcome. If you buy Goliath off Amazon (no judgment!), let me know what weird stuff Bezos tells you to include with your order.The theme of todayxe2x80x99s issue is race and monopoly, and in particular, the political economy of the Jim Crow system of violently enforced racial apartheid that stretched across the American south from the late 1890s until the 1960s. First, in case youxe2x80x99re interested in seeing me alive and talking instead of as a disembodied voice in your inbox, I was on TheHill.TV with Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti to discuss China and monopoly power.The China-NBA story isnxe2x80x99t over, by a long shot, and I suspect, as I told Tobias Hoonhout at the National Review, corporate America will now be empowered to stand up to China. Anti-monopoly Republican Senator Josh Hawley announced he is going to Hong Kong, and Democrats are beginning to reframe their approach to China.And nowxe2x80xa6The Atlanta Compromise and Jim CrowI just wrote a book on monopoly power, and one of the core questions that I wrestled with as I researched was racial identity and monopoly power. I donxe2x80x99t think I was fully successful, but to be fair, itxe2x80x99s a hard problem. In historian Gerald Berkxe2x80x99s review of my book in The American Prospect, he identifies this lack as one of the flaws in the book, and points out that we need a lot more historical research on the relationship between social identity and economic power. Berk is one of the best business historians alive today, and I take his views quite seriously.As Berk notes, there is no consensus on the relationship between the anti-monopoly tradition and social identity. The basic thinking behind anti-monopolists is what is known as producerism, or the notion that some produce and should reap the fruits of that production, while others feed off the production of others. Democrat Elizabeth Warren and Republican Josh Hawley, both Senators, have producer-ist philosophies Berk notes that producer-ism is the essence of American egalitarianism, but it can also carry dangerous and fascist elements. As he writes, xe2x80x9canti-monopolyxe2x80x99s producerist ideology can look down as readily as up to identify adversaries. When it does, immigrants, African Americans, and women are coded as nonproducers alongside bankers and monopolists, equally worthy of vilification, regulation, and exclusion.xe2x80x9dBut Berk also shows that anti-monopolists have a strong history of inclusivity around identity, referencing xe2x80x9cstudies of black chapters of the Farmersxe2x80x99 Alliance by Lawrence Goodwyn, Gretchen Ritter, and Omar Ali; the importance of antitrust in protecting black businesses which supported the civil rights movement by Brian Feldman; and anti-monopoly support for Native Americans in Portland, Oregon, by Robert Johnston show how anti-monopoly and racial movements work together toward interracial freedom from economic oppression.xe2x80x9dThere is a fascinating question here about anti-monopoly movements and racial justice movements. But there is also another side of this bargain, which is the relationship between monopolists and racial oligarchy. One of the most important books ever written about American history is W.E.B. Du Boisxe2x80x99s Black Reconstruction, published in 1935. In that book, Du Bois took on the mainstream of American historical thought about the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. At the time Du Bois wrote, most white Americans believed that Reconstruction was a disaster, with xe2x80x98carpetbaggersxe2x80x99 from the North aligning with black ex-slaves to take power and act irresponsibly and corruptly in Southern states. The very first film blockbuster, Birth of a Nation, told the story of this xe2x80x98Lost Causexe2x80x99 history, honoring the aims of the Confederacy, and valorizing the post-war Ku Klux Klan as heroic. This history was not true; immediate post-Civil War legislatures, with both black and white representatives, did things like construct public schools and tax the rich.Du Bois pointed out that the Lost Cause myth was constructed for economic reasons. It helped solidify the post-war dominance of Northern industrialists, many of whom were stretching railroads around the nation and beginning to assert monopoly power. These Northern financiers, having been supportive of the Union cause, after the war began building alliance with southern white conservatives, with ex-slaves, poor whites, Northern immigrants to the south, ex-planters, and free labor industrialists in a swirl of post-war political chaos. From the end of the war in 1865 until the first major downturn, which started in 1873, there was a fertile battle over political power, which ended with a banking panic set off by railroad over-building and the fall of Jay Cookexe2x80x99s bank. Herexe2x80x99s how Du Bois put it.For a brief periodxe2x80x94for the seven mystic years that stretched between Johnson's \"Swing round the Circle\" to the Panic of 1873, the majority of thinking Americans of the North believed in the equal manhood of Negroesxe2x80xa6  They simply recognized black folk as menxe2x80xa6Then came in 1873-76 sudden and complete disillusion not at Negroes but at the worldxe2x80x94at business, at work, at religion, at art. A bitter protest of Southern property reenforced Northern reaction; and while after long years the American world recovered in most matters, it has never yet quite understood why it could ever have thought that black men were altogether human. This depression happened because Cooke was over-leveraged, and because the Federal government imposed massive austerity through a return to the gold standard. The downturn had important implications for racial attitudes, monopoly capital, and the very possibility of democracy itself. The crash caused the anti-slavery Republicans to lose their hold over Congress, and began the organization of an ideology that came to fruition in the late 1800s and early 1900s with the establishment of Jim Crow and J.P. Morganxe2x80x99s great merger wave of 1895-1904. Despite the downturn, the Jim Crow system didnxe2x80x99t start immediately after Reconstruction ended in 1877. If black men could not be social equal to whites after 1877, the argument about whether they could still have political power was not settled until 1895, nearly 20 years later. As C. Vann Woodward noted in his classic The Strange Career of Jim Crow, wholesale segregation was often seen as irrational by southern conservatives, who would have to construct separate facilities that did not exist during the antebellum plantation era. But multi-racial farmer movements of populists in the 1880s and 1890s, as well as bitter strikes like the 1892 Homestead strike in Pennsylvania, terrified both northern monopolists and southern conservatives, who cemented an alliance that became the Jim Crow system of autocracy.An important figure in this deal was conservative thinker Booker T. Washington, the most important black leader since Frederick Douglass. Washington ran what was known as the xe2x80x9cTuskegee Machine,xe2x80x9d and in 1895, he gave a speech called the Atlanta Compromise, which was widely interpreted as black southerners acceding to the deal between Southern conservative whites and Northern monopolists. Washington, importantly, accepted the Lost Cause history. Herexe2x80x99s what he said.Ignorant and inexperienced, it is not strange that in the first years of our new life we began at the top instead of at the bottom; that a seat in Congress or the state legislature was more sought than real estate or industrial skill; that the political convention or stump speaking had more attractions than starting a dairy farm or a truck garden.In this deal, blacks would give up political rights and the right to gain higher positions in commerce, in return for xe2x80x98industrial educationxe2x80x99 in farming and business and the protection of commercial rights of black business people and workers. Southern blacks, and Booker T. Washington, were in an extraordinarily difficult situation in the 1890s, beset by virulently racist whites and concentrated capital hostile to liberty. Washingtonxe2x80x99s strategy was a conservative accommodation to power, an attempt to wrest what he could. In return, his Tuskegee University was financed richly by Northern monopolists. As historian David Levering noted, Andrew Carnegie astounded American higher education in 1903 with his six-hundred-thousand-dollar endowment gift to Tuskegee, and from John D. Rockefeller Sr.xe2x80x99s deep pockets a ten-thousand-dollar annuity had been paid since the 1890s to Tuskegee.The very next year after the Atlanta Compromise speech, two pivotal events occurred. There was the titanic election of 1896, in which the farmer populist William Jennings Bryan lost to the banker supported William McKinley. And then there was of course there was the Supreme Court case of Plessy vs. Ferguson, which solidified Jim Crow. While Washington was the dominant black political leader in the 1890s, the Atlanta Compromise was a disaster for African-Americans. Much of the new legal apartheid system and its violent extra-legal terrorist enforcement mechanisms were, as economist Lisa Cook shows, targeted at black economic power. The failure of accommodation to deliver even an iota of social justice was a core reason Washingtonxe2x80x99s influence began sagging in the 1900s. Du Bois got his start as an activist and intellectual in the 1890s. He soon broke with Washington, and helped form the NAACP in 1911 as a competitor to Washingtonxe2x80x99s Tuskegee Machine. The NAACP was put together by a group of white and black progressives who sought political equality (though the white leaders of the organization did not, at first, want social equality). With Black Reconstruction, Du Boisxe2x80x99s thinking about how to organize opposition to Jim Crow eventually became dominant, soon to be reflected in the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s. His historical take was a critical part of revisiting the Jim Crow deal, and its underlying myths. For instance, the lawyer for the losing side of Plessy vs Ferguson - Albion Tourge - had been a hero of Reconstruction, in Du Boisxe2x80x99s telling. Not only was Tourge a great civil rights proponent, but by the 1890s he had become a fierce anti-monopolist as well. Racial oligarchy and plutocracy were, as he and Du Bois realized, a political union. (Tourge is also a hero in Harvard Business School professor Laura Phillip Sawyerxe2x80x99s book on the politics of small business, American Fair Trade)In many ways, battles in the 20th century over political economy, like Teddy Rooseveltxe2x80x99s New Nationalism, Woodrow Wilsonxe2x80x99s New Freedom, and most importantly, the New Deal and the Civil Rights movement, were ways of wrestling with the fundamental bargain struck of Jim Crow in the mid-1890s, the entrenchment of fascism in the United States along racial lines in the South, supported, at least tacitly, by monopolists in the North. Therexe2x80x99s a lot more here, of course, and Ixe2x80x99m quite curious what you think. Berkxe2x80x99s observation about race and the anti-monopoly tradition still holds, we need a lot more historical research in this area. I also highly recommend Richard Whitexe2x80x99s Railroaded on Western railroads, and Josh Hawleyxe2x80x99s book on Teddy Roosevelt. Hawleyxe2x80x99s book covers the racialist legacy of the late 19th century American elite and its relationship to the creation of corporate America.Thanks for reading.

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6Todayxe2x80x99s issue is about how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) just censored a Houston Rockets basketball executive, and why this move blew up into a geopolitical scandal.  The episode reflects the dangerous amount of power that China has gained over the U.S. and reveals the failure of the Clinton-Bush-Obama administration foreign policy frameworks. And as an added bonus, under Obama, Joe Biden was the point man to deal with Chinese leaders.But first, some house-keeping. Next week Ixe2x80x99m going to explain in more depth why you should do this, butxe2x80xa6  pre-order my upcoming book, Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy. A few years ago, I feel like I lucked into a learning about the secret history of political economy and power in the 20th century. The book, and this newsletter, are the result. If you pre-order it, the book gets on various lists and gets more promotion from fancy people, which then leads to more exposure, and more lists and promotion, etc. That means that the ideas you and I care about - democracy in commerce - get to a wider audience.Itxe2x80x99s already causing trouble. So far, Ed Luce at the Financial Times attacked my arguments about fascist Chinese power, and Farhad Manjoo in the NYT used the book to recast the Obama era in a way that generated bitter pushback from senior Obama officials. This is the debate we need to have as a society. So pre-order it! If you like this newsletter, you will love Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.And nowxe2x80xa6(Photo by Kenneth Lu)The Out of Control Chinese Leader Xi JinpingOver the weekend, the Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet favorable to Hong Kong protesters, a tweet that said xe2x80x9cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.xe2x80x9d Twitter is banned in China, and the tweet would have ordinarily been ignored. But Chinese politics is changing; Xi Jinping, having consolidated power using nationalistic rhetoric, has unleashed Cultural Revolution-style pressure inside Chinese bureaucracies. Any bureaucrat who doesnxe2x80x99t ramp up volume aggressively against even a perceived slight to Chinese honor could be undermined or even imprisoned. There are many examples of this hyper-nationalism; earlier this year, the Chinese government denied visas to German lawmakers who criticized the countryxe2x80x99s human rights record. In this case, the offending party was just a basketball team executive. Yet, the CCP can apparently brook no resistance, anywhere. Chinaxe2x80x99s state-owned top broadcaster said it would stop showing team events, and Chinese tech giant Tencent announced it would no longer live-stream games or carry team news. China's consulate general in Houston said the team should clarify its views, and the Chinese Basketball Association, led by former NBA player Yao Ming, cut all ties with the Rockets.The National Basketball League KowtowsThe Rockets are a popular team in China, and China is an important market for the NBA. It would be hard to convey the level of sycophancy to the Chinese that business leaders in America immediately adopted. Morey deleted his tweet and apologized, top NBA player and Adidas spokesperson James Harden said sorry to the Chinese, and the NBA issued two statements, a mild one in English and a harsh condemnation of Morey in Chinese. The billionaire owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, criticized his own employee. October 5th 2019Most amusingly, the billionaire owner of the Nets, Chinese tech giant Alibaba co-founder and prominent Yale Law donor Joseph Tsai, wrote an essay condemning Moreyxe2x80x99s comments, bringing up 19th century Opium Wars as one rationale for why all 1.4 billion people were immediately offended at the comments of someone posting on a platform banned in China.Why does China have so much leverage?The Chinese market is massive, both as an importer and exporter. We can see it use its power to attempt to bully U.S. politicians over agricultural products in hopes of gaining leverage in the trade war. This NBA situation is no different.Among the nearly 1.4 billion people who call China home, 640 million of them watched some kind of NBA programming over the course of the 2017-2018 season, per league figures. That's nearly twice the population of the entire United States.\"When global partners are looking at the NBA, I think for them the two big markets are really the U.S. and China,\" Chang said. \"And in some respects for some of these guys, they start to look at China as almost a bigger opportunity going forward.xe2x80x9dThe National Basketball Association, like most American producers of goods and services, sees the potential for eye-popping profits in China. Of course, itxe2x80x99s a trade-off that comes with steep costs, like censorship. And it will ultimately collapse because the CCP is not interested in trade, it is interested in dominance. Since the 1980s, the Chinese have used a simple set of strategies to take over industrial capacity. First, use imports and foreign financing/know-how to learn the business, then gradually replace foreign businesses with domestic ones, and finally subsidize the Chinese producers abroad until they dominate the global market. The Chinese have done this across many different sectors, most prominently the telecommunications equipment space, with Huawei causing a global national security crisis as it is now the best value for telecom equipment buyers in the world.Itxe2x80x99s not obvious how the Chinese could learn how to replace the NBA or international soccer, which is also quite popular in China. China is investing in youth sports, but my guess is that it wonxe2x80x99t replace foreign sports starts with its own stars, because therexe2x80x99s no real strategic need to do so. The CCP will simply impose conditions on global sports, ensuring that, like with Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, sports becomes a zone where politics are not allowed. It is increasingly doing that in Hollywood, as the U.S. government noted in 2015.  A lot of people are saying that the NBA is greedy, willing to sacrifice human rights for profits. And in some sense, that is true. But what just happened to the NBA is a result of signals the U.S. government has been sending to the American business community for years, that commercial relationships with autocracies - however compromised they may appear - ultimately help lead to democracy. Bill Clinton pioneered this policy framework. The idea was called xe2x80x98engagement' with China, and many Western China watchers, in an orientalist fantasy world, sought to xe2x80x98shapexe2x80x99 China as a great power compatible with the liberal international order. As I wrote in June, this policy was part of a xe2x80x9ca global utopian view, peddled most aggressively by Thomas Friedman in his 1999 book The Lexus and the Olive Tree and his 2005 The World is Flatxe2x80xa6. China would become a democratic state, slowly, because its people wanted McDonaldxe2x80x99s and X-Boxes, and McDonaldxe2x80x99s and X-Boxes turned countries democratic.xe2x80x9d Clintonxe2x80x99s policies sent large chunks of the U.S. industrial base and American factories to China. Under Clinton, U.S. businesses exported capital and technology and even armed the Chinese state, accidentally transferring missile machining tools to the Chinese military.  George Bush and Barack Obama continued this policy architecture. Bush oversaw the main years of the xe2x80x98China shock', when Wall Street, private equity, and China cooperated to rip the economic guts out of the midwest. During the Obama administration, despite some rhetoric of a xe2x80x98pivot to Asiaxe2x80x99 to deal with China, this policy architecture largely dominated D.C. One very clear example is that of how Joe Biden sought to sell American entertainment product while Vice President.Joe Bidenxe2x80x99s China DealIn 2012, Hollywood studios were increasingly frustrated at their inability to get into the Chinese market. China had maintained a system whereby American studios could sell only 20 films a year into their fast growing theater chains, and often wouldnxe2x80x99t make decisions until after the movies were made. This created a situation where studios would preemptively censor their own creative work in the hopes that their films would be imported by China.The Obama administration, pursuing the strategy of engagement, or deepening trade ties, sought to loosen this restriction. And they sent Joe Biden to cut the deal, as Cecilia Kang reported.During a luncheon [in 2012] in Los Angeles, Vice President Biden convinced China's vice president to agree to a deal that would unlock new fortunes for Hollywood. Biden asked Xi Jinping to relax China's quota of allowing only 20 foreign films to be shown at a time and to increase distribution fees for Hollywood firms.China had been reluctant to change its decades-old restrictions meant to control the flow of non-Chinese films into the nation that could hinder its own arts industry. But Biden pressed his Chinese counterpart during those last hours of Xi's five-day U.S. visit.\"By the end of the luncheon, we had a handshake,\" Biden said Friday at the Creativity Conference hosted by the Motion Picture Association of America, Microsoft and ABC News. As a result, \"your share of box office revenues doubled,\" Biden told the crowd of network executives, studio heads and technology lobbyists.Part of this deal was straightforward aid to a U.S. industry, Biden doing the bidding of former Senator Chris Dodd, who had since become the head of the Motion Picture Association of America. Biden joked there were rumors in the Senate that Dodd \"controlled me,\" adding that he left a meeting with Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to speak at the MPAA event.But this deal also signaled to American entertainment executives, including those at the NBA, that U.S. government policy was to encourage more trade with China, no matter what. If they sought to sell their product in China, the U.S. would back them with geopolitical muscle. What Biden and the United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk didnxe2x80x99t consider was the leverage over studio output that that increased dependency on the Chinese market gave to the Chinese government. Such leverage has already been an important part of Chinaxe2x80x99s exporting power. For decades, China has been an important factory for the world. I wrote about this dynamic in July.The list of products and commodities companies say they can no longer make in America is long. Nylon products, optical scanners, consumer robotics, electronics, all types of clothing, specialty chemicalsxe2x80xa6 etc. China has become the factory of the worldxe2x80xa6My favorite example is Stephen Lang of the American Bridal & Prom Industry Association, who said, xe2x80x9cwe can't make wedding gowns and prom dresses in the United States.xe2x80x9d The entire labor force for doing so, and even things like beads for hand-sown adjustments, are now in China. xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s impossiblexe2x80xa6 We can't even get the materials in this country to make this clothing.xe2x80x9dFrom prom dresses to point of sale terminals, the argument from American distributors is pretty much always the same. The ecosystem of production doesnxe2x80x99t exist in the U.S. anymorexe2x80xa6China uses a host of monopolizing strategies to extend its geopolitical and commercial power, everything from below cost pricing to grab market share, patent trolling, espionage, mergers, and financial manipulation. In fact, the CCP is best understood as a giant monopoly that also controls a nation of 1.4 billion people and a large military apparatus. In 2010, China used its power as an exporter to withhold rare earth minerals, a vital component in electronics production. And now, Chinese government strategists recognize that the country is no longer just a key exporter, but has leverage through its importing status. The exertion of power over the NBA is just the latest example.Wexe2x80x99ve Been Here BeforeAs usual, therexe2x80x99s a historical analogy.In the 1930s, the Nazis sought, through the size of the Germany market, to prevent Hollywood from making movies critical of the Hitler regime, with some success. More importantly, Germany used monopolies and cartels to extend its economic power over foreign countries, even before its tanks rolled in to occupy them.Herexe2x80x99s FDRxe2x80x99s Attorney General Francis Biddle, in 1944: \"The integration of the European industrial economy under German leadership and control was well advanced, accordingly, even before the war began.\" The Germans subsidized certain key industries, and then used those subsidies to force foreign producers to cut deals to restrict output. They doled out patents selectively so that French, British, and American companies could only use some advances. It was a comprehensive strategy:Nazis used their American subsidiary corporations to spy on U.S. industrial capacity and steal technology, such as walkie-talkies, intertank and ground-air radio communication systems, and shortwave sets developed by the U.S. Army and Navy. They used patents or cartel arrangements to restrict the production of stainless steel, tungsten-carbide, and fuel injection equipment. According to the U.S. military after the war, I.G. Farben, the Nazi chemical monopoly, had influence over American production of xe2x80x9csynthetic gas and oils, dyestuffs, explosives, synthetic rubber (xe2x80x98Bunaxe2x80x99), menthol, cellophane, and other products,xe2x80x9d and sought to keep the United States xe2x80x9centirely dependentxe2x80x9d on Germany for certain types of electrical equipment. Biddle saw what they were doing with cartel arrangements, saying that \"German productive capacity increased as the non-German companies, resting on the security of these agreements, continued to restrict their own capacity and output, to limit their technical research and to neglect generally the development of new processes.\" Naturally the Germans were using all of these output restrictions to prevent the U.S., the French, and the British from building up their armaments capacity, especially in the high-tech aluminum/aerospace area.China is doing the same thing. In September 2018, the Pentagon released a report about U.S. dependency on China, and focused not on civilian items but inputs critical to the military. The DOD wrote that xe2x80x9cChina is the single or sole supplier for a number of specialty chemicals used in munitions and missilesxe2x80xa6. A sudden and catastrophic loss of supply would disrupt DoD missile, satellite, space launch, and other defense manufacturing programs. In many cases, there are no substitutes readily available.xe2x80x9dOn the production side, the the whole world is now highly dependent on China. On the other side, importing, the NBA kowtowing shows that the intertwining of economic exchange is even more dangerous than we assumed. But there is a bright side.Xi Jinpingxe2x80x99s Massive ErrorPresident Xi is, like Trump, a cunning but not especially brilliant mafia boss style leader of a major geopolitical power. He has given himself lifetime office and purged the top ranks of the Communist Party, which has radically restructured corporate and political bureaucracies in China. Chinese bureaucrats are aggressively attacking anyone who makes any sort of critique of Chinese government policy, whether it is smart to do so or not.This is especially true with the recent protests in Hong Kong. Hong Kong protesters are a sore spot, because it is particularly embarrassing for nationalists to see people who they think of as Chinese rejecting CCP rule. Chinese leaders have until relatively recently been able to engage in soft and effective projections of power bribing elites through consulting contracts, think tanks, and academic sinecures. No longer.Chinaxe2x80x99s biggest asset in gaining power was how most people in the West just didnxe2x80x99t realize that the CCP aimed to use it. Now Chinaxe2x80x99s cover is blown. The raw exercise of power to censor a random Houston Rockets basketball executive has made millions of people take notice. Everyone knows, the Chinese government isnxe2x80x99t content to control its own nation, it must have all bow down to its power and authority. Even as late as July, the older China watchers were still trying to plead for a strategy of shaping China into a xe2x80x98constructive playerxe2x80x99 in the international stage, instead of realizing that we have to use what power we have to protect ourselves (see this embarrassing open letter signed by dozens of elite China experts). Earlier this year, Joe Biden let slip that he doesnxe2x80x99t realize how much power dynamics have shifted.At a campaign stop in Iowa City, Iowa, Biden pointed to his years serving as vice-president and as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, telling the crowd that therexe2x80x99s not a xe2x80x9csingle solitaryxe2x80x9d world leader who would trade the problems the United States faces for those confronting China.xe2x80x9cChina is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,xe2x80x9d said Biden, who last week announced his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.xe2x80x9cThey canxe2x80x99t figure out how theyxe2x80x99re going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system,xe2x80x9d Biden said of China. xe2x80x9cI mean, you know, theyxe2x80x99re not bad folks, folks. But guess what? Theyxe2x80x99re not competition for us.xe2x80x9dBiden had to walk back his comments after he was roundly criticized for the naivete of his remarks. Biden learned quickly. And that is a very good thing, that the consensus is solidifying against the dangerous actions of Xi Jinping and the CCP. The West is in a lot of trouble. But the single biggest problem is that our strategists and thinkers were asleep, unaware of the danger of an autocratic Chinese apparatus. No longer. As I noted, China is increasingly central to 2020. (Democrats may even eventually realize that foreign policy means more than just blowing things up in the middle east, but also includes trade, finance and even entirely different regions like East Asia!). The bottom line is, we may respond well to China, or we may respond badly to China. We will, however, respond. And itxe2x80x99s about time.Thanks for reading.

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6One of the best parts of writing this newsletter/blog is hearing from you. And thatxe2x80x99s what todayxe2x80x99s issue is about, how you experience the sloth, misery, and instability driven by monopoly power.My basic theory of about why wexe2x80x99re having problems in our political economy is that guys like this are in charge of the world. These are the consultants, both named Bob, from the movie Office Space, which is a Mark Twain-esque comedy about the misery of office culture, in which financier-driven executives and their management consultants passive aggressively bully and disillusion everyone around them. Aside from Office Space, therexe2x80x99s actually another similar comedy made at roughly the same time all about the military bureaucracy and corruption called The Pentagon Wars. In the real world, there are different flavors of this horror show; Ixe2x80x99ve profiled Adam Neumann at WeWork, what happened to Boeing, and private equity itself. But itxe2x80x99s pervasive.Last week I asked you for stories on corruption/monopolization in your corner of the world. Today Ixe2x80x99m publishing two letters. The first is from a young engineer who is trying to find interesting and hard engineering problems to work on. His story is about the real reason productivity growth is slowing, both in big businesses and in the start-up world of Silicon Valley. The second is from a person working at a French beauty products company dealing with work/life balance.Both reflect the personal experience many of us have gone through or are going through in a world organized by a philosophy prioritizing short-term oriented financial goals instead of liberty and innovation.Subject: Monopolization/Fraud in my corner of the worldHi Matt,I'm an early-career software engineer working at a \"mobility services\" startup, and your rigorous but entertaining analysis of monopoly power has been really validating. I don't really expect that you'll read this or find it particularly interesting, but after seeing your post today I felt compelled to share my personal experience of monopoly power with you.I got my BS in Computer Science recently. I was a low-income first-generation student from the rural midwest and I saw the need-based full ride they offered as my ticket into the middle class. I got a software engineering internship at Procter and Gamble, but declined a cushy full-time return offer because I was interested in doing cutting-edge engineering work with big data and as far as I could tell, very few white-collar workers at P&G really did anything. All I saw was a lot of bureaucratic box-ticking and people patting themselves on the back for work that they hired consultants to do for them. P&G as a whole really just reminded me of the trust-funders I went to college with. There was zero exposure to actual risk or competition but everyone had to pretend to be innovating and competing in order to justify their success. I swear to God my manager actually took me aside at the beginning of my internship and said \"at the end of the day, nothing you or I do is really going to impact P&G's bottom line, so I wouldn't stress too much about your projects.\" He meant this to be comforting, but as a kid who had grown up in a farming community (and spent summers working on farms) where a single wrong decision and a few days of slacking off might make the difference between a slight profit for the year and insolvency, it rubbed me the wrong way. [ed. The current P&G is a result of a merger with Gillette in 2005.]So I decided I wanted to work in the tech industry. I figured that if I wanted exposure to risk and to actually be in an environment where innovation was the only way to be competitive, a small tech startup would be a great choice. I was wrong.The company I now work for started as a parking app. They built a solid user base with their great customer service and user experience. They hired smart and ambitious people and gave them equity. When I joined, we prided ourselves on staying lean and delivering a great product and everyone had skin in the game. The integrations we had with access control systems and the great technology we offered to parking operators helped us win major deals. That technology and our relationship with those operators eventually gave us an economic moat. We were growing sustainably as the result of having a superior product based on a great understanding of consumer needs.But sustainable growth isn't what VCs (or the execs that they install in the firms they have stakes in) are looking for. So we pivoted.Without going into too much detail, we are now exclusively focused on getting acquired by a big tech firm. Meetings with low-level product managers at a few of the world's largest companies dictate every decision about which projects we pursue. We're no longer building a company. We're not even building a product. We're building a feature that we hope will end up getting included in an app owned by a mega-corporation.When I talk to my friends and peers at other tech startups, they tell me that it's pretty much the same story at their companies. Everyone is building to the specifications set by Google or Amazon or Apple. This \"competitive\" industry, supposedly a shining example of the power of the free market, is really just a massive risk-free R&D department for the FAANG companies.The whole thing is pretty demoralizing. It's made me realize that monopoly power has chilling effects that extend far beyond the offices of the P&Gs and Googles of the world. Anyway, that's my rant. If you took the time to read it, thanks. I look forward to your next post.Subject: kid and family managementAs an introduction, I am French and only worked as an in-house consultant for a French luxury group. No need to restructure/fire people or anything, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) was super high and money was being thrown out the windows every day.One day (I had already quit my job and was leaving a few weeks later), I was in a call on organization needs for a specific market. The problem for this market was that salespeople were very unhappy because they missed their families due to long hours and long commutes. The proposed answer was to increase the staff (again, remember, super high EBIT and growth prospects).My bosses, instead of simply nodding and moving on (we weren't the deciders for the extra staffing anyway) insisted that the market director shouldn't hire more people but instead ask her employees to work on heir \"kid and family management\"... Seriously? Does that even mean something?? I was desperate to see how bullshit language had impregnated every cell of my bosses' corporate selves. Don't people ever stop and consider situations for only one moment??Anyway, good luck on compiling all the stories - I am sure you must now have a very large database.Greetings from Parisps: I had lent \"Bullshit jobs\" to a colleague from the luxury company, his boss forbade him to leave the book on his desk...So there we go, two simple stories. There are many more. Feel free to send me yours, and make your subject line entertaining. What are the lessons? Well this political economy problem is eminently solvable. There are reasons for hope, immense hope even. Imagine the brilliance and innovation if the tens of millions of people who today are forced to do useless nonsense are set free to tinker and explore. That is where we could go, and where I think we will soon head if we just make better public policy choices. Thanks for reading.

I also liked this email. The last line is tremendous.I worked for a company that hired a consultant with a Harvard MBA, our CEO was way too enamored with the Ivy League. He wouldn't listen to his own people, but his Harvard consultant was from Harvard so she must know what she was doing. Anyway, the Harvard MBA lady was also lazy, so I wrote her analysis for her. (although her versions were prettier) This allowed my boss (COO) and I to get our ideas implemented, and gave us that fancy Harvard sheen.

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6Itxe2x80x99s the 70th anniversary of the Peoplexe2x80x99s Republic of China, which Xi Jinping is celebrating with aggressive rhetoric and a militaristic display of his ICBMs that can strike at the U.S. in 30 minutes. So today Ixe2x80x99m going to write about how American aerospace monopolists, dumb Pentagon procurement choices, and the Bill Clinton administration helped create the Chinese missile threat we are now confronting. But first, two house-keeping notes. First, I asked for stories about management consulting stupidity, and you responded. Ixe2x80x99ll be publishing some of your thoughts, from both the employee side and the consulting side (xe2x80x9cconfession of the Bobxe2x80x99sxe2x80x9d). Feel free to send me your story if you havenxe2x80x99t yet. Ixe2x80x99m going to be delving more into what seems to be a crisis of management in corporations and governing institutions across the West. Second, the piece I wrote WeWork post went viral. It was reposted on Business Insider and the Stigler Centerxe2x80x99s ProMarket blog, and someone sent me an email with this wonderful line: xe2x80x9cBy the way, I knew Adam Neumann before he launched WeWork and everything you said about him is 100% accurate.xe2x80x9d I wrote that piece partially because I know there are 10,000 people who had to work for Neumann and deal with his behavior, and someone needed to point out that cruel behavior from bosses is not ok.And nowxe2x80xa6How America Equipped China with Missile TechnologyIn August of 1994, Bill Clintonxe2x80x99s Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, flew to China to try and seal two deals for American corporations. The first was to enable Chrysler the ability to build minivans in China, and the second was to get the Chinese to buy 40 MD-90 aircraft xe2x80x98Trunklinersxe2x80x9d from McDonnell Douglas. The McConnell Douglas deal was particularly important to the Clinton administration for a number of reasons. The company was dying; it was badly run by financiers who lacked an appreciation for quality production. More importantly, it had lost a key military contract for the F-22 in 1986, so the government felt an obligation to find customers to prop it up. There was also politics, with Bill Clinton trying to honor his unofficial 1992 campaign slogan, xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s the economy, stupid.xe2x80x9d  Clinton would indeed hail the deal on the eve of the 1994 midterm election. The Chinese agreed to buy the planes, but with one caveat. They wanted a side deal; McDonnell Douglas should sell a mysterious company called the China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC) a set of specialist machine tools that shape and bend aircraft parts stashed in a factory in Columbus, Ohio. When Chinese representatives went to Columbus, Ohio, workers wouldnxe2x80x99t let them see the tools, because workers realized that they would lose their jobs if the tools were sold to the Chinese. The Chinese then sent a letter to the corporation saying that the deal for the Trunkliners was at a stalemate, but if the machine tools were sold to a mysterious Chinese company, well, that would have a xe2x80x9cbig influencexe2x80x9d on whether McDonnell Douglas could close the deal on the planes. It wasnxe2x80x99t just the workers who caused problems. The government could have been a hurdle for McDonnell Douglas as well, because these werenxe2x80x99t just any old machine tools. xe2x80x9cAccording to military experts,xe2x80x9d reported the New York Times, xe2x80x9cthe machines would enable the Chinese military to improve significantly the performance abilities -- speed, range and maneuverability -- of their aircraft. And if diverted, they could do the same for missiles and bombers.xe2x80x9d Selling the tools wasnxe2x80x99t just a commercial deal, the machining equipment was subject to export controls for sensitive national security technology. It was an insane idea, selling the Chinese government this important machining capacity. The Pentagon protested vehemently, as did Republican Congressman Tillie Fowler, who was on the Armed Services Committee. Fowler said allowing the transfer to reflects an ''emphasis on short-term gain at the expense of national security and long-term economic gain.'' And yet thatxe2x80x99s what McDonnell Douglas sought, and what the Clinton administration pushed through. The Commerce Department cleared the deal, in return for a pledge (or behavioral remedy) that China would not use the tools to build missiles, but would dedicate them to a civilian aircraft machine tool center in Beijing.  McDonnell Douglas basically knew the behavioral remedies were fraudulent almost immediately; one of the most important pieces of equipment was shipped not to Beijing but directly to a Nanchang military plant.  It wasnxe2x80x99t just McDonnell Douglas who understood the con; Clinton officials had the details of the deal, and let it go through anyway. Why? They used the same excuses we hear today - competitiveness and a fear of offending China. Herexe2x80x99s the NYT explaining what happened.xe2x80x9cAmerican officials want to avoid sending any signals that would fuel China's belief that the United States is trying to ''contain'' China's power, militarily or economically. And they know that if they deny a range of industrial technology to China, other competitors -- chiefly France and Germany -- are ready to leap in and fill the void.xe2x80x9dChina never honored the overall deal. By 1999, China had acquired only one of the 20 promised Trunkliner airplanes. And three years later, the Federal government indicted McDonnell Douglas for xe2x80x9cconspiracy, false statements and misrepresentations in connection with a 1994 export license to sell 13 pieces of machining equipment to China.xe2x80x9d The government also went after the Chinese company. Still, this was too little too late. The episode was by any metric catastrophic; the Chinese government got missile making machine tools in return for a promise they didnxe2x80x99t honor, which should have been a massive scandal, borderline treason. But ultimately it wasnxe2x80x99t a scandal, because Republicans, leading globalization thinkers, and Clinton Democrats decided that transferring missile technology to China didnxe2x80x99t matter.  Remember, during this entire period, Bill Clinton pressed aggressively to open up the U.S. industrial base to Chinese offshoring. And towards the end of the Clinton administration, McDonnell Douglas, as we all now know, later merged with Boeing, and that merger ended up destroying the capacity of Boeing - by then the sole American large civilian aircraft maker - to manufacture safe civilian planes.How Bill Clinton Made the Worst Strategic Decisions in American HistoryChinese power today is a result of a large number of incidents similar to this one, the wholesale transfer of knowhow, technology, and physical stuff from American communities to Chinese ones. And the confused politics of China is a result of the failure of the many policymaking elites who participated in such rancid episodes, and are embarrassed about it. As we peer at an ascendant and dangerous China, it makes sense to look back at how Clinton thought about the world, and why he would engage in such a foolish strategy. Broadly speaking, there were two catastrophic decisions Clinton made in 1993 that ended up eroding the long-term American defense posture. The first was to radically break from the post-World War II trading system. This system was organized around free trade of goods and services among democratic nations, along with somewhat restricted financial capital flows. He did this by passing NAFTA, by bailing out Mexico and thus American banks, by creating the World Trade Organization, and by opening up the United States to China as deep commercial partners. The Clinton framework gutted the ability of U.S. policymakers to protect industrial power, and empowered Wall Street and foreign officials to force the U.S. to export its industrial base abroad, in particular to China. The radicalism of the choice was in the intertwining of the U.S. industrial base with an autocratic strategic competitor. During the Cold War, we had never relied on the USSR for key inputs, and basically didnxe2x80x99t trade with them. Now, we would deeply integrate our technology and manufacturing with an enemy (and yes, the Chinese leaders saw and currently still see us as enemies).The second choice was to reorganize the American defense industrial base, ripping out contracting rules and consolidating power into the hands of a small group of defense giants. In the early 1990s, as part of the xe2x80x98reinventing governmentxe2x80x99 initiative, the Clinton team sought to radically empower private contractors in the government procurement process. This new philosophy was most significant when it hit the military, a process led by William Perry.In 1993, Defense Department official William Perry gathered CEOs of top defense contractors and told them that they would have to merge into larger entities because of reduced Cold War spending. xe2x80x9cConsolidate or evaporate,xe2x80x9d he said at what became known as xe2x80x9cThe Last Supperxe2x80x9d in military lore. Former secretary of the Navy John Lehman noted, xe2x80x9cindustry leaders took the warning to heart.xe2x80x9d They reduced the number of prime contractors from 16 to six; subcontractor mergers quadrupled from 1990 to 1998. They also loosened rules on sole sourcexe2x80x94i.e. monopolyxe2x80x94contracts, and slashed the Defense Logistics Agency, resulting in thousands of employees with deep knowledge of defense contracting leaving the public sector.Perry was a former merger specialist who fetishized expensive technology in weapons systems. But what Perry was doing was part of an overall political deal. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration radically raised defense spending. Democrats went along with the spending boost, on condition that they get to write the contracting rules. So while the Reagan build-up was big and corrupt, it was not unusually corrupt. When Clinton came into office, his team asked defense contractor how to make them happy in an environment of stagnant or reduced defense spending. The answer was simple. Raise their margins. The merger wave and sole source contracting was the result.The empowering of finance friendly giant contractors bent the bureaucracies towards only seeing global capital flows, not the flow of stuff or the ability to produce. This was already how most Clinton administration officials saw the world. They just assumed, wrongly, that stuff moves around the world without friction, and that American corporations operate in a magic fairy tale where practical problems are solved by finance and this thing called xe2x80x98the free market.xe2x80x99 In their Goldman, McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group-ified haze of elitist disdain for actually making and doing real things, they didnxe2x80x99t notice or care that the Chinese Communist Party was centralizing production in China. They just assumed that Chinese production was xe2x80x98the free marketxe2x80x99 at work, instead of a carefully state-sponsored effort by Chinese bureaucrats to build strategic military and economic power. Part of this myopia was straightforward racism, an inability to imagine that a non-white country could topple Western power. Part of it was greed, as Chinese money poured into the coffers of Bush-era and Clinton-era officials, as well as private equity barons. This spigot of cash continued through the Bush and Obama administrations. For instance, during the Obama administration, Mack McLarty - President Bill Clintonxe2x80x99s first chief of staff - made $300 million in luxury auto dealers in China after Secretary of State Hillary Clintonxe2x80x99s chief of staff helped broker an introduction to key Chinese leaders. But most of it was a general view that the role of American policy leaders is to sell American finance abroad. Herexe2x80x99s how Larry Summers put it in a 1998 speech pompously titled xe2x80x9cThe Challenges of Success.xe2x80x9d I bolded a few parts.The world looks very different than it did at the beginning of this decade, a time when America was said to be in decline. It is now clear that America will grow faster in this decade than Japan and Europe. Their four-decade-long story of convergence has ended and America is pulling further ahead. Why this success? A large share of the credit must go to the two forces that this conference brings together: technology and finance.The twin forces of intonation technology and modern competitive finance are moving us toward a post-industrial age. And if you think about what this new economy means - whether it is AIG in insurance, McDonald's in fast-food, Walmart in retailing, Microsoft in software, Harvard University in education, CNN in television news - the leading enterprises are American. In fact, Summers was papering over problems in the American engineering world that had been slowly festering for some time. I got a remarkable email from an engineer who watched this happen first-hand, which Ixe2x80x99ve pasted below my signature. Read it. He details the intertwined problems of failed governance and corporate leadership that started in the 1980s but really accelerated in the 1990s.The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations didnxe2x80x99t notice these problems, because they lacked the wisdom to listen to engineers and people who actually work for a living. They didnxe2x80x99t understand that workers who blocked Chinese buyers looking at vital machine tools had savvy and integrity that they themselves lacked.Today, because of that lack of wisdom, the dangerous and increasingly totalitarian Chinese leader Xi Jinping has the capacity to launch missiles at the U.S. that can hit American cities in 30 minutes, and feels no need to disguise his global ambitions. It didnxe2x80x99t need to play out this way.If we change our strategy, we can prevent the end of liberal democracy or civilization itself. That is on us, across the West, and among those who believe it is in the capacity of humanity to build a peaceful and prosperous world.Thanks for reading.

I got this remarkable email from an engineering who watched the collapse of American aerospace and military technology first-hand.I worked for the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from 1970-1980.  That is when the problems with the US Aerospace industry really began. Jacque Gansler was really the instigator of what William Perry ultimately accomplished.  Jack between his 2 stints with DoD Jacque got his PhD in Economics.  But before this degree, his ideas were already frozen that the Defense Industry had to consolidate because of economies of scale. Those of us managing technology exchange between the competitors thought otherwise.After I left DoD, I continued to watch this consolidation folly as a consultant to Defense contractors, including Sunstrand.  Harry Stonecipher was President and CEO of Sunstrand.  After destroying Sundstrand, he moved to McDonnell Douglas, orchestrated the Boeing merger and then proceeded as the president and COO of Boeing to plant the seeds to destroy Boeing.But, back to Jacque.  Jacque not only hollowed out the Defense Industry, he did the same to the ability of DoD to manage the industry. My job at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was in Manufacturing Technology.  We actually had real engineers who did real work.  There were our counterparts in each of the manufacturing plants. This included both civilian and military engineers.  There were honest to God reviews and fights over what was to be done and how to do it.  During the time period of 1970 to 1980's The DoD designed and produced the A10, F15, F16, F14, F-117, B1B the C5.   Also, a fleet of Cruise Missiles, the HumVee and the M1 Abrams.  It was a most exciting and honest time.In my latest stint with DoD my job was not manufacturing.  But old friends asked me to visit Boeing and look at the problems with the 787.  In spite of my clearances and position, Boeing would not let me near the 787.  I was allowed to look at 737 production.  In the old DoD, a telephone call from the Pentagon to Boeing would have changed this.  Now, it was clear that Boeing was in charge.I was also asked to visit the F35 plant in Fort Worth.  This was the former General Dynamics F16 plant.  General Dynamics was a victim of consolidation. I was quite familiar with how the plant was back in the 70's and 80's.  Gordon England, who later became DepSecDef was at GD Fort Worth at the time.  But, that is yet another story.Lockheed did let me have as much time in the F35 plant as I wanted.  And, I had free reign to talk to anyone.  I was totally appalled by what I saw.  It was clear that the rate of production promised would not be accomplished with the plant as designed.  Even more disturbing was that there was complete lack of DoD oversight - none.  There were no DoD engineers in the plant.  Back in the Pentagon I asked to meet with the procurement people who were in charge of DoD industrial policy.  There had been such a thing during the time when DoD did not take 35 years to produce an AC that still does not meet it design objectives and did not cause pilots to pass out xe2x80x93 the F35.  I was told that the lack of an industrial policy is an industrial policy.  Around that time the administration changed from Bush to Obama and the situation only got worse.  I let it go and continued my job while continuing to seethe inside.The lack of an industrial policy is not only in the DoD.  As a private pilot I follow closely General Aviation.  Similar consolidation as occurred there.  Troubling as that is, it is not as serious as the fact that the Chinese have taken over the US General Aviation industry.  There are 2 piston AC engine companies.  Continental and Lycoming.  Continental was Teledyne.  Now, it is owned by the People' Republic of China, as is Mooney.  The US General Aviation industry collapsed in the 1970's.  In addition to product liability issues, there had not been a change to the design of GA AC for decades.  Cirrus Aircraft started in 1984 and totally disrupted and nearly revitalized the industry with the design of plastic piston AC.  This was followed by a personal jet.  Today Cirrus builds more AC each year that all of the other piston AC manufacturers, and probably will do the same with their jet.  They are owned by People's republic of China since 2011.  Piper AC has escaped the Chinese.  They are owned by the Government of Brunei.  These Governments are not here because of the airplanes.  They are here for the manufacturing technology - composites in the case of Cirrus.  They are here because today's GA AC are platforms for the most advanced avionics and, in case of Cirrus, jet engines in the world.  I doubt that a Chinese engineer could walk into the door of Garmin - the leader in AC systems.  But, certainly a Cirrus engineer can.  The Cirrus Glass Cockpit is equal to those of today's airliners.  The Cirrus Jet engine is made by Williamxe2x80x99s International.  Williams makes jet engines for our Cruise Missiles. The Chinese must really think Americans are naxc3xafve, if not totally stupid.Matt, I know that my little soliloquy goes beyond your piece about Boeing.

If youxe2x80x99d like to sign up, you can do so here. Or just read onxe2x80xa6Today Ixe2x80x99m going to write about a topic that continues to get chatter both on the campaign trail and on CNBC/Bloomberg, which is the performance of the stock market if Wall Street nemesis Elizabeth Warren continues to pick up steam in the Democratic primary and ultimately becomes the President.First, some housekeeping. There are thousands of readers of BIG at this point, and you guys are generally super smart.  Soxe2x80xa6 send me tips! Like most of you, I am a frustrated professional who likes to see things work and work reasonably well, and I think the main political problem we face is that these guys are now in charge of everything. Help me tell the story of monopolization/fraud in your corner of the world.In future issues Ixe2x80x99m going to cover the Israeli anti-monopoly movement and its weird relationship to Bibi Netanyahu, banking concentration and turmoil in repo markets, how Pentagon leaders actually think about corporate concentration among defense contractors, and why intentional negligence is a core part of any well-run predatory monopoly. Also, Ixe2x80x99m interested in predatory monopolistic software providers in niche industries, like software for hospitals, small banks, auto dealers, and nonprofits. And nowxe2x80xa6Would an Elizabeth Warren Win Crash the Stock Market?I was watching Bloomberg TV this morning, and saw an invited guest explain a recommendation to clients that they bet on a declining stock market in advance of the main Democratic primaries, in case Elizabeth Warren wins. September 27th 2019In explaining her theory, this analyst needlessly used the word xe2x80x98heretofore,xe2x80x99 which is a good indication she was just trying to sound smart. So my guess is that shexe2x80x99s a random Wall Street person, and is reflecting an emerging conventional wisdom. CNBC often covers fear of Warren; random anonymous private equity Democrats just told CNBC they will back Trump if Warren is the nominee.  I imagine Trump will probably say that anyone who opposes him will cause the stock market and economy to tank.So letxe2x80x99s ask that question. What happens if Warren wins?The Bear Case: Warren Will End the Stock Market Monopoly PremiumThe bear case is pretty obvious. Elizabeth Warrenxe2x80x99s basic philosophy is producer-ism, which is that the people who do the work, whether that work is making or designing things, doing service work, or managing, should get the rewards from that work. Her belief is that corruption - whether through monopolization, financial manipulation, or conflicts of interest - are a way of extracting revenue and exerting control over people who work for a living. This philosophy manifests in a number of ways. She wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, both through higher income taxes and an annual wealth tax. A wealth tax of two percent would force people like Jeff Bezos and the Walton family to sell stock on a regular basis. Warren would probably stop stock buybacks from the corporate treasury, and she would rapidly slow mergers and acquisitions. She would break up banks and more broadly tightly regulate finance and private equity. She would also shift the output share of the American corporate apparatus away from returns to capital and towards labor through pro-worker policies. All of this would put a drag on stocks.In addition, her trade posture of economic patriotism would induce cost increases as in-shoring replaces offshoring, and she would probably take an aggressive approach to health care, defense industrial consolidation/contracting and climate change, meaning shifts in the petrochemical complex, defense stocks, the electric utility industry, and pharma and health insurance. These may harm the market overall, but they may just help and hurt specific sectors.The strongest case though for Elizabeth Warren as a bearish indicator is the idea that  stock market valuations are premised on froth and fraud. We have capitalized monopoly rents, and many billionaires - from Peter Thiel to Warren Buffett - are billionaires precisely because they buy into industries without competition.Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have recommended to clients that they should welcome oligopolies, and buy them. Oligopolies may have a bad reputation for pillaging consumers, but they are attractive because in Goldmanxe2x80x99s view they have xe2x80x9clower competitive intensity, greater stickiness, and pricing power with customers due to reduced choice, scale cost benefits including stronger leverage over suppliers, and higher barriers to new entrants all at once.xe2x80x9dInvestors could read that loud and clear: Oligopolies can squeeze workers and suppliers, hike prices on consumers, and that makes oligopoly stocks attractive buys.Popular investment books openly recommend monopolies. Before the financial crisis, you could find a book titled Monopoly Rules: How to Find, Capture and Control the Most Lucrative Markets in Any Business. It offered advice to young entrepreneurs, xe2x80x9cyou probably learned that monopolies are unnatural, illegal, and rare. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! In fact, monopolies are often natural, usually legal, and surprisingly common.xe2x80x9d Just in case the government held a different view, it advised earmarking part of the very high profits xe2x80x9cfor top-flight anti-trust attorneys.xe2x80x9dBuffett calls monopolies businesses with xe2x80x98moats.xe2x80x99 Under Elizabeth Warren, antitrust enforcers might start calling them crimes. That probably wonxe2x80x99t be good for equity valuations.The Bull Case: Warren Will End the Stock Market Monopoly PremiumThe bull case is actuallyxe2x80xa6 the same idea. Everything that Warren would do would be oriented towards producer-ism, and producer-ism is good for business. For example, right now, Boeing is having serious problems because its products arenxe2x80x99t very good, a result of corruption and financialization.Just a year ago Boeing appeared unstoppable. In 2018, the company delivered more aircraft than its rival Airbus, with revenue hitting $100bn. It was also a cash machine, shedding 20% of its workforce since 2012 while funneling $43bn into stock buybacks in roughly the same period. Boeingxe2x80x99s board rewarded its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, lavishly, paying him $23m in 2018, up 27% from the year before.There was only one problem. The company was losing its ability to make safe airplanes. As Scott Hamilton, an aerospace analyst and editor of Leeham News and Analysis, puts it: xe2x80x9cBoeing Commercial Airplanes clearly has a systemic problem in designing, producing and delivering airplanes.xe2x80x9dIf Warren breaks up Boeing and erodes the corruption underpinning Boeingxe2x80x99s business model, who knows what would happen to investor holdings? Maybe one of the spinoffs of Boeing might go down, but other parts of the company could go up as value gets unlocked. It could be in aggregate a net increase in market value. If the aerospace industry gets healthier in terms of products, the resulting multiple spinoffs may become more profitable because therexe2x80x99s just more value to go around.To take a better example, look at Facebook and Instagram, Amazon and AWS, or Google and YouTube. Scott Galloway notes that any of these, if spun off, would probably lead to net increases in overall market value. Amazon and AWS are probably worth more apart than together, same with Facebook and Instagram. This isnxe2x80x99t just true in technology; in 2015, Goldman Sachs said that JP Morgan should be broken up and that would *help* stockholders in the bank.Historically, break-ups and producer-ist policies have actually not been bad for the stock market. There are examples, like Teddy Roosevelt filing an antitrust suit against Northern Securities, that caused market problems. But there are many examples of just the opposite. One of my first newsletter issues was about how Standard Oilxe2x80x99s break-up, the break-up of electric utilities, and the break-up of AT&T in 1982 all increased productivity, innovation and stock prices. The Standard Oil break-up helped lead to the gasoline industry, the AT&T break-up helped lead to the internet. In both cases, an incumbent was squatting on world-changing technologies.Imagine today Google being broken up into eight companies. I choose eight because Google has eight products with more than a billion users apiece: Search, Maps, Play, Android, Drive, Chrome, Gmail, and YouTube. What innovations in, say, the mapping space are being withheld because of larger strategic goals of Alphabet? I have no idea, but in the 1960s, it seemed very unlikely that software, then a free product bundled by IBM and then unbundled due to an antitrust suit, would become a trillion dollar economic force. As legal scholar Tim Wu asks, how many massive new world-changing industries donxe2x80x99t exist because monopolists wonxe2x80x99t let them come into being?There Is No SpoonUltimately, I have no idea whether the stock market will go up or down under Warren. What you think will happen boils down to what you believe politically about economic growth.Do you believe that organizing low corporate taxes, encouraging financial engineering, and allowing markets to be the fiefdoms of aggressive monopolists keeps stock prices high? If so, then you would probably assume that Warren will be bad for stocks. Do you believe that there are yet worlds unseen, if only the human spirit is set free to tinker and sell? If so, then therexe2x80x99s a possible bull case, though such a case is complicated by the question of whether new and wonderful businesses will show up in higher stock valuations.Either way, what Wall Street analysts are really saying is more about ego than predictions. Warren believes that the stock market shouldnxe2x80x99t be higher or lower, it should be a much less important part of the economy, largely irrelevant to the day to day decisions of business leaders and workers. Financiers, she believes, should simply not matter that much. And this, Wall Street will not abide.Thanks for reading.

I recently ran into someone who works for a Time Warner. Like all Time Warner employees, she is heavily involved in the merger with AT&T. The merger kind of makes business sense, though only if the management of the new company is absolutely exceptional and has the ability to mesh two very different business lines into a mean and lean targeted ad machine. AT&T does not have such a management. What they have, instead, are management consultants.These consultants are something of a nightmare. If you ask them a question or ask for a spreadsheet, you get a request for an increase scope of work with a bill attached. This is exactly the kind of story I heard from government employees and government contractors about consulting, which is that itxe2x80x99s a misery inducing graft. Management consulting is a way for managers to not do any work or show any leadership, in both the corporate sector and government sector. Which incidentally is why both corporate America and the government canxe2x80x99t do anything anymore!Anyway, you guys are smart, experienced, and disillusioned. Send me your stories on the worst management consulting experience youxe2x80x99ve had or seen. Tell me about your Bobxe2x80x99s. Ixe2x80x99ll strip your name out and send along the story for all of us to enjoy.You can just reply to this email, or email me at stoller at gmail.com.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Would an Elizabeth Warren Win Crash the Stock Market? - BIG by Matt Stoller","url":"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/would-an-elizabeth-warren-win-crash"}

After the 2008 crash, banks were kicking people out of their homes at such a furious pace that states couldnxe2x80x99t keep up. In Florida, an old judge was pulled out of retirement to preside over a special high-speed xe2x80x9crocket docketxe2x80x9d court. He sat at the head of a small conference table in a cramped room, and I watched as he rubber-stamped stacks of foreclosures, sending a queue of bewildered homeowners on the street xe2x80x94 one every few minutes, on average. The people lining up to surrender their homes were middle- and formerly middle-class Americans, whoxe2x80x99d managed to scratch out enough to buy a home at one point, but were certainly not rich. One worked at a pool-cleaning company, another was a waitress, a third was a school administrator, and so on. They were white, African-American, Latino, Asian, and they expressed a range of emotions, from shock to shame to anger.One woman was bewildered to learn that she couldnxe2x80x99t learn, for sure, the identity of the note-holder on her home. The hack lawyer filing for the banks that day xe2x80x94 a bumbling character who entered court with two hands around a stack of foreclosure petitions that accordioned like Dagwoodxe2x80x99s sandwich xe2x80x94 claimed to be suing her on behalf of Wells Fargo. But the documents in her file claimed Wells had purchased her loan from Wachovia in May of 2010, two years after Wachovia went out of business, and three months after Wells originally sued her, a logical impossibility.The woman seemed too confused to be angry. Mainly, she couldnxe2x80x99t believe what was happening. xe2x80x9cThe land has been in my family for four generations,xe2x80x9d she said. xe2x80x9cI donxe2x80x99t want to be the one to lose it.xe2x80x9d She got a temporary reprieve that day, but a hundred others like her did not.About a year after that, at Zuccotti Park in New York, it struck me that if Occupy Wall Street could attract the people from places like that Rocket Docket in Jacksonville, it might have overrun the country. At the time, the emerging criticism of Wall Street that was coming from younger, urban, college-educated activists had not yet lined up with the gigantic reservoir of rage that was out there among the millions whoxe2x80x99d lost homes, jobs, pensions, etc. Not only were many of those people whoxe2x80x99d been foreclosed upon or laid off or forced to watch their 401Ks lose half their value still in emotional shock, but the underlying corruption was not exactly easy for them to see. Propaganda blasted out on every channel, to the effect that it was your own fault if you took on an adjustable-rate mortgage that went sideways, or bought too big of a house. People above all feel shame when they canxe2x80x99t pay their debts, and many took it to heart when pundits said the crash was caused by people buying houses they couldnxe2x80x99t afford.Those criticisms often came out as racial politics, as conservative media figures hammered the theme of the xe2x80x9cwater drinkersxe2x80x9d who crashed the economy at the expense of the xe2x80x9cwater carriers.xe2x80x9d Listening to these takes, resentment in some neighborhoods grew toward the family down the street whoxe2x80x99d been foreclosed upon, leaving a boarded-up eyesore on the block and collapsing property values for those left. The Tea Party movement, launched by a rant on CNBC against a proposed bailout for minority homeowners in particular, steered public anger away from Wall Street and toward the xe2x80x9cbad behaviorxe2x80x9d of the xe2x80x9closersxe2x80x9d down the street. xe2x80x9cHow many of you people want to pay your neighborxe2x80x99s mortgage, that has an extra bathroom, and canxe2x80x99t pay their bills?xe2x80x9d screeched Santelli, to xe2x80x9cAmerica,xe2x80x9d which was actually a group of booing traders on the Chicago Board of Exchange:A decade later, itxe2x80x99s understood that while the subprime scam did disproportionally target minority homeowners xe2x80x94 a typical victim was an elderly Black woman sold a refi by a door-to-door shark, who promised her a little extra spending money each month xe2x80x94 the scale of the crash was so massive that everyone suffered. By 2021, people are not only unafraid to admit their lives were altered by the collapse of the housing bubble, theyxe2x80x99re no longer blaming neighbors but bigger players, and the system protecting them. This was one of the subtexts of the interview I did this week with xe2x80x9cSP,xe2x80x9d the GameStop investor whose post, xe2x80x9cThis is for you, Dad,xe2x80x9d went viral during the GME frenzy. SPxe2x80x99s family was devastated by the 2008 crash. His uncle lost his house to foreclosure. xe2x80x9cThey were in an ARM and got adjusted right out of the house,xe2x80x9d SP says (an xe2x80x9cARMxe2x80x9d is an adjustable-rate mortgage). xe2x80x9cWe didnxe2x80x99t even know theyxe2x80x99d been foreclosed on. We went over and the place was empty and the lights were off. There were a bunch of houses like that on the street.xe2x80x9dSP, whose father also was put out of his house and job at that time, recalls the messaging about the homeowners themselves being at fault. xe2x80x9cThere was the macro scapegoating of the financial crisis in 2008, when they said people should know better than to take out loans they can't afford,xe2x80x9d he says. xe2x80x9cI was like, xe2x80x98Okay, well, people should go and smoke. People should know not to speed. People should know not to drink and drive.xe2x80x99 But they have warning labels on those things, right? Police officers will pull you over, if you speed.xe2x80x9cHowever,xe2x80x9d he goes on, xe2x80x9cwith the financial crisis, you had a system that was incentivized for bad behavior. And some didn't have to pay the price for that bad behavior.xe2x80x9dThat last point is relevant to a recent article by Eric Levitz in New York magazine, xe2x80x9cThe GameStop Rally Exposed the Perils of xe2x80x98Meme Populism.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d The piece among other things takes a shot at me and a few other media figures, for driving what he called a xe2x80x9cbalefully misguided progressive discoursexe2x80x9d through hype of the GameStop story. It seems people like me mistook xe2x80x9cthe cause of recreational investors for that of the proletariat,xe2x80x9d and failed to understand that while xe2x80x9cthe showdown between WallStreetBets and Melvin Capital was not a class war, it did play one on CNBC.xe2x80x9dI was particularly at fault, apparently, for decrying the TARP, zero-interest-rate policy, Quantitative Easing, the CARES Act, and other xe2x80x9cartificial stimulantsxe2x80x9d that have been keeping asset prices high, and the 30 percent of American companies that are functionally broke, alive. In doing so, Levitz said, I implied that xe2x80x9cthere is some xe2x80x98naturalxe2x80x99 benchmark interest rate that exists outside of politics and policy, and that the Fed is corruptly flouting this natural market lawxe2x80x9d xe2x80x94 in other words, a xe2x80x9clibertarian argument for central banks to tolerate deeper recessions and higher unemployment.xe2x80x9dIt was the betrayal of betrayals, he said, xe2x80x9cthe kind of thing one might expect to find in a column by Taibbixe2x80x99s archnemesis, Thomas Friedman.xe2x80x9dAs to the question of whether or not the people in wallstreetbets are genuinely the xe2x80x9cproletariatxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cworking-class,xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99ll defer to Levitz. He seems interested in litigating that issue, which Ixe2x80x99m not. Ixe2x80x99d only point to the interview with SP, and to the others on wallstreetbets who chimed in with stories about the aftermath of 2008, and say these tales make sense to me. I listened to similar stories for almost ten years: the Black prison guard in Boston with the cancer-stricken wife who lost his house because he was sold an ARM when he thought he was buying prime, the firefighter in Providence who lost his pension, the clerk of a California city that had to slash services after losing millions in the Lehman disaster, etc. Is that the xe2x80x9ccause of the proletariat?xe2x80x9d I have no idea. I do know that I ran into a lot of pissed-off people over the years.Why they were pissed off gets to the second question, about the bailouts, ZIRP, the TARP, even the CARES Act. While so many people went into personal tailspins from 2008 on, their nightmares were often compounded watching as the very people who caused the crash xe2x80x94 including the banks and mortgage originators who knowingly pumped mountains of fraudulent subprime instruments into the economy xe2x80x94 not only got saved but were further enriched, by bailouts and an array of extravagant Fed programs.Some people got ripped off three times. First, they were personally sold dodgy exotic mortgages. Next, their retirement funds were sold the same kinds of dicey loans in the form of securities. Lastly, when it all blew up, they paid taxes to bail out the whole shooting match.The issue with the xe2x80x9cartificial stimulantsxe2x80x9d isnxe2x80x99t that some form of rescue wasnxe2x80x99t necessary, but rather that the rescues that were implemented were both executed poorly and inherently unfair in design. From the TARP through the CARES Act to the now interminable programs of Fed purchases, bailouts led directly to massive booms for banks and financial asset-holders, while everyone else saw personal wealth decline. Market forces exist for some, but not others.Perhaps some form of rescue was necessary, but therexe2x80x99s something odd going on when a bank executive can be looking at closing up shop one day, as many were last March, only to go on to secure record profits and over $30 million in personal compensation, with nothing changing in between but a bailout. Meanwhile, at the bottom of the economic spectrum, there were no such reversals of fortune. You lost your job, you got foreclosed on, that was it. As Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger said all the way back in 2010, addressing individual homeowners who might want bailouts, xe2x80x9cSuck it in and cope.xe2x80x9d One $2000 check doesnxe2x80x99t change the pattern.The financial crisis among other things was worsened by a hyper-concentration of capital, and the systemic risk giant supermarket financial firms caused to the economy (which made them difficult to regulate). In rescuing the banking sector, the Fed and the Treasury not only didnxe2x80x99t address this problem, they worsened it, folding small problem banks into bigger ones in a series of mega-mergers, leaving us with a handful of giganto-banks even bigger and more systemically dangerous than before. The implied promise of bailouts also resulted in lower borrowing costs for big banks versus small ones, a subsidy one study calculated to be worth $34 billion a year. And that was before we even got to the question of all the unpunished fraud and crime that was swept under the rug as an implied part of the various rescues, with the Fed creating special facilities to hoover the problem loans out of circulation (using the euphemism, xe2x80x9ctoxic assetsxe2x80x9d). This sense of built-in unfairness is what animated at least some of the GameStop investors. Seeing the field isnxe2x80x99t level, they saw the GME trade as a rare chance to tilt tables in their direction, even if fleetingly. For people like SP, this was an explicit consideration. He says he was motivated to hold not just by his own family experiences after the dot-com crash and after 2008, but by looking at the landscape in pandemic America, which once again contrived policies to make smaller smaller, and bigger bigger. xe2x80x9cYour favorite sandwich shop, closed. If you've got 200 of those sandwich shops, open,xe2x80x9d is how he puts it. One last note: when I first started covering this topic all those years ago, most of the flak that came my way (and toward other critics of Wall Street) came from the right, or from Ayn Rand acolytes like Megan McArdle. During Occupy Wall Street, criticism of finance sector antagonists came out as pure aristocratic sneering, i.e. these whiners need to stop listening to Phish, get a job, and take a shower:Now, in response to exactly the same criticisms of the inequities of the financial system, including the use of public funds to once again massively enrich private companies (like the banks that just scored record profits underwriting the Covid-19 bailouts), the defense of these policies is more likely to be framed as coming from the left. If you think itxe2x80x99s not fair that a small business faces a different market risk than Morgan Stanley, if it seems wrong that a restaurant is allowed to fail but not a bank, youxe2x80x99re a libertarian. In the Trump era, every criticism of establishment politics apparently has to be framed as conservative grift.GameStop is a complex story. There are big institutional players on all sides. Itxe2x80x99s not necessarily a xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d thing that a struggling video game firm became worth more than international airlines overnight. Trading in the stock may indeed have been restricted because of laws requiring that brokers have the capital to cover trades, although Robinhoodxe2x80x99s collateral calls dropping from $3 billion to $1.4 billion in few hours seems a bit odd (as does the fact that the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation has rarely been so finicky about compliance issues before, across a generation of naked short-selling and other practices).For all that, therexe2x80x99s a reason this story resonated. Therexe2x80x99s a lot of anger out there, and it will jump at chances to express itself, no matter how much those of us in the media argue over what to call it.

There were plenty of crooks in the housing bubble on Wall Street and in the mortgage brokering business.  They should all be in jail.  On the other hand, there were loads of people who knowingly took out liar loans and they should be in jail too.  You never hear that though.  Every borrower was a victim.  Not true.  It took two to tango.  Three in this case - greedy Wall Street bankers, deceptive and dishonest brokers and lying or stupid borrowers.  None should be let off the hook and none should be pitied.

Retail investors, including many subscribers to a Reddit forum called wallstreetbets, pushed the companyxe2x80x99s stock from $6 to $43.03, but experts said playtime was over. It was time for the big shots to clean up. According to Citron Research, one of many funds that had bet on the brick-and-mortar store to fail, those investing in GME were xe2x80x9cthe suckers at this poker game,xe2x80x9d and would soon be sorry when the stock went xe2x80x9cback to $20 fast.xe2x80x9dThey were wrong. Instead of amateurs being shoved aside by hedge funds, it was the pros who had their backs broken, as GME soared to $65.05, beginning a steep ascent that would become an international news phenomenon. It was the xe2x80x9cWexe2x80x99re gonna need a bigger boatxe2x80x9d moment for Wall Street. The pros had been sloppy. By late 2020, shares in GameStop were well over 100% short. A sudden rise in value would force shorts to pay exorbitant prices just to get out of the trade. By the afternoon of the 21st, all the xe2x80x9csuckersxe2x80x9d on Reddit had to do to beat them was nothing, and they did just that, behind the rallying cry xe2x80x9cdiamond hands,xe2x80x9d signifying a determination to hold at all costs.Why hold? One of the millions of subscribers to wallstreetbets posted a note, explaining what the trade meant to him:This is for you, DadI remember when the housing collapse sent a torpedo through my family. My fatherxe2x80x99s concrete company collapsed almost overnight. My father lost his home. My uncle lost his home. I remember my brother helping my father count pocket change on our kitchen table. That was all the money he had left in the world. While this was happening in my home, I saw hedge funders literally drinking champagne as they looked down on the Occupy Wall Street protesters. I will never forget that. My father never recovered from that blow. He fell deeper and deeper into alcoholism and exists now as a shell of his former self, waiting for death. This is all the money I have and Ixe2x80x99d rather lose it all than give them what they need to destroy me. Taking money from me wonxe2x80x99t hurt me, because I donxe2x80x99t value it at all. Ixe2x80x99ll burn it down just to spite them. This is for you, Dad. The post went viral, scoring over 70,000 upvotes the first day and ending up on the front page of Reddit. The author, who had gone to lengths to keep his identity private, saw his Reddit handle xe2x80x9cSpace-peanutxe2x80x9d inundated with press requests, from podcasts all the way up to the New York Times. Stuart Varney of Fox Business News read his post out loud on live television.  Meanwhile, on wallstreetbets, Redditor after Redditor responded with similar tales.xe2x80x9cMy mother lost her house that spent 20 years saving for in 2008 while raising me and my sister,xe2x80x9d wrote one. xe2x80x9cI remember sitting on the curb, trying to keep it together myself at 16 while watching her break down uncontrollablyxe2x80xa6xe2x80x9dxe2x80x9cMy dad is a carpenter and thirty years of work, retirement, and savings was nearly wiped out,xe2x80x9d wrote another, adding: xe2x80x9cThis is for you, Dad.xe2x80x9dA third letter described a man who, having lost his dairy business after the crash, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the face in the woods. He survived, leaving his son to xe2x80x9ccarry his blown-apart body to the house,xe2x80x9d only to finish the job by throwing himself in front of a train soon after. xe2x80x9cSpace-peanutxe2x80x9d watched in awe as stories piled up. The thread soon read like the untold history of America after the 2008 financial crisis:The original poster, whom Ixe2x80x99ll call SP, was unaccustomed to attention. A one-time military man and father of two, he had no other social media presence and joined Reddit exclusively to comment about stock on wallstreetbets. He was overwhelmed by what he calls xe2x80x9cjust an endless Rolodex of sad stories,xe2x80x9d nearly all referencing the same period after the crash.xe2x80x9cI think that's why my post, however terse, hit such a nerve,xe2x80x9d he says. xe2x80x9cSo many people were saying, xe2x80x98I have deep pain from this point in time, too.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d An acquaintance of a long-ago source of mine, the man reached out this week. Across several conversations, he explained what GameStop meant to him, and why. For a variety of reasons, mainly having to do with his professional situation, he asked to remain anonymous. SP is cautious, articulate, and well-read. In our first call, one of the first things he told me was that even growing up, hexe2x80x99d xe2x80x9calways wanted to work on a trading desk.xe2x80x9d I asked why. The answer was a three-decade story that ran all the way to GameStop. Itxe2x80x99s reproduced below, in Q&A form. Since 2008, the tendency among mainstream commentators has been to shrug off reverberations from the crash that force their way into news, usually on the grounds that the millions who lost homes, careers, marriages, lifetimes of savings, health, and in thousands of cases, their lives, are not truly poor or xe2x80x9cworking class,xe2x80x9d or are only xe2x80x9crelatively low-wealth,xe2x80x9d as New York magazine recently put it. In the case of GameStop, therexe2x80x99s been a parade of stories describing investors as dupes, dummies, financial Trumpists, irresponsible gamblers, even crooks, their trade pegged as almost everything but what on some level it surely was and is, an echo of a suppressed national disaster. Was GameStop xe2x80x9crecreationalxe2x80x9d investing gone haywire, or a climax to a story building for a generation? Herexe2x80x99s one personxe2x80x99s answer:SP: I grew up watching my parents struggle with money. Money was discussed all the time. They fought all the time. The older I got, the more I felt I had to do anything to keep my own kids from going through the same thing.My parents worried in different ways. With my mother, I regularly knew how much money was in her checking account because she would stress-yell the amount whenever I asked for anything. It was really difficult for her.My dad was the opposite. He wanted you to think he had money, but you were looking around and thinking, \"I'm pretty sure we don't.\" Because I don't have a bed, and my brother is sleeping on a couch. So if you've got it, maybe we should use it, I don't know. So they were different in that regard.From the time I was eight and nine, I was spending summers working. When I was with my father he thought it was important for us to do the hardest manual labor possible.TK: Was that supposed to be about character-building?SP: So my dad thought it was a good idea, but at the same time, I think he needed to go to work. And that was the best place for us to be, because I don't think he could leave us alone all day. So he was like, \"I know what we'll do. I'll bring you to work. You can work and then we'll be together.\" (Laughs) That was character-building, yes. I built a lot of character out there. I'd say that much. I had way too much character.To this day I know I can outwork people in physical labor simply because my threshold for what is considered difficult is much higher, because I spent summers as a child doing that. I'm not sure where that squares with labor laws, but it happened.TK: What kind of work?SP: At that time, we were doing field work out where we were from. So you're doing a lot of leaching, which just is basically watching a big field fill up with water to prepare it for planting. One summer, we were doing that. And then we tore down houses. We were working with other guys who were grown men and didn't speak English.Those guys would do anything to get here and take that job, especially the day laborers. They wake up super early, go to a spot where they know a contractor is going to drive by, and try to pick some of them up for the day. I mean, not an easy existence. So it's difficult to hear people lambast a specific group of migrant workers. I feel like saying, \"Hey, I know I've done work with migrant workers and I'll tell you what, that would be difficult to say, xe2x80x98This is what I'm going to do my whole life.xe2x80x99 I'll tell you that right now.TK: What did your mother do?SP: After the divorce was over, she moved to a new state, and she spent years starting up a new business, a dining guide in a big city. Put her own money in it. There was a lot of driving, over an hour every morning to get to the city, then appointments all day. She was a single mom at the time, so she had to get back, get the kids, take care of us. But she was doing well. She had advertising contracts lined up and after years of work, was just about ready to launch, when the dot-com bubble burst and she lost it all.Almost overnight, the only thing really left of the business was a fax machine in our apartment. Before, companies would be faxing her signed agreements, letters of intent, and so on. All the marketing calls would come back to that number hanging on the fax machine. So basically, anything connected with her company was coming back there.For a long time, she would just lay on the couch, locked in depression. The fax would go off from time to time and she wouldnxe2x80x99t react, she would lie there in a daze. Looking back on it, it must have been painful every time that fricking thing rang, a reminder of the thing you failed at. Just imagine, you're so close to making it, and then an exogenous shock prevents you from achieving the dream youxe2x80x99d set out for yourself.She could've just let that beat her down forever. But she eventually got her shit together and was like, \"Hey, I need to retool myself.\" She went back to school, got a master's degree, started teaching. My dad, on the other hand, didn't do that. He never got over what happened.TK: This was the concrete company?SP: Right. In the 2000s, he was a superintendent at a concrete company that was very successful for a time, employed hundreds of people. I worked there, too, when I was 19. Again, there were a lot of migrant laborers doing this work too, guys who were supporting families back in Mexico. And 2008 hit, another financial collapse.There was such explosive growth, and all of the sudden, it was gone. My father lost his job, his house, and he just got worse and worse and worse. Hexe2x80x99s got heart problems now, hexe2x80x99s on a bunch of medication. I just expect to get the call any day that he's going to be dead. He's just circling the drain. He's been in and out of the hospital. He doesn't take care of himself.One of the people who answered my post on Reddit talked about how he felt the crash basically robbed his father from him. That's how it was. We used to talk five times a day, man. Talking to my dad was the most reliable thing that I could do. I talked to him and my brother four or five times a day for fifteen, twenty years. And then over the past probably four or five years, it was less and less. I think I went a full year without talking to him. He didn't know I got married. He hasnxe2x80x99t seen my second daughter.Ixe2x80x99ll tell you, when you look in the eyes of a grown man who has no options to support his kids, thatxe2x80x99s devastating. I decided when I first saw that in him, I would sweat blood to make sure that never happened to my family.I put myself through school, going for the cheapest state tuition, and did the same for the MBA program. I was able to take out a loan and I was able to start the program a semester early, while I was still finishing undergrad, so I could economize the cost. And then I went straight through both summers and got it done really quickly, overloading my class schedule because I didn't want to take out more loans. So I got it done for $25,000, and I was working full-time too, while I was there. Later, I was able to save up enough to get it completely discharged, though in order to do that, I had to have five roommates for four years.TK: Why business school, why finance?SP: By the time I was getting ready to go to college, my brother had already been in the Marine Corps for a few years and had already done two tours in Iraq, and it was the worst time to be there. He saw a lot of carnage. And he was saying, \"You know, if you still want to be in the military, it's a much better route if you go to college first, from what I've seen.\" And every single person I'd ever done manual labor jobs with had said, if they could do one thing differently, they would have gone to college. Theyxe2x80x99d be on the job and put a hand on my shoulder and say, \"You don't want to have to do this when you're 50.\" Like I'm 50, I'm hanging drywall. It's my company, but it would be nice to not have to do it.Anyway, I got into being a Wall Street trader when I was an undergrad. I liked the high energy. I also knew a bunch of people from my home city that grew up to be traders. (Laughs). Some of them were really dumb and some of them didn't even finish high school, but they knew a guy who was on the floor like (mimics a Chicago accent) \"And my boy Tony, he hooked me up with a jawb on the exchangexe2x80xa6xe2x80x9dBut they made a lot of money. I thought, \"This is ridiculous. I'm more intelligent than that guy.\" He could barely do math, but hexe2x80x99s trading options. Still, I liked hanging out with those people. Some of them were not real class acts, butxe2x80xa6 I liked the idea that it was challenging. I just wanted to study everything I could. I knew I was going to be competing with people that had way better educational pedigrees than I did, and I needed every single edge that I could get just to get myself in the door.I got really interested in the question, \"what were the things you look for when a company starts going into financial dire straits?\" That led me down the path of finding good books that had been written in the past about major bankruptcies and collapses, books like When Genius Failed, Predatorxe2x80x99s Ball, and A Colossal Failure of Common Sense. I was studying companies like Long Term Capital Management, which got bailed out in the late nineties.At the time, it was just interesting to see how, when people did their homework and took a big risk on some distressed debt, they could make a gigantic payday in one day. And I was like, man, that would be exhilarating. I even saw the original movie Wall Street and I was like, \"That's badass. Even though these guys are criminals, just the idea of being on a trading floor seems really cool.\"Now I look back at that and think, if Ixe2x80x99d become that person, Ixe2x80x99d be sitting in the place of some of these hedge funds who do this all day. They go out and find companies that are going to be struggling at a specific date and time, and that's when they start buying massive put spreads, shorting the piss out of the stock, putting it in the dirt, ensuring it will fail. I look back on it now, and it's like, xe2x80x9cGoddamn, that would have really sucked.xe2x80x9d They're two very different paths I was going down. I'm glad I chose this one.TK: What was the other path?SP: Look, I originally did all that reading because I was looking for insights on how to make money. But studying firms like Drexel Burnham Lambert, Long Term Capital Management, Lehman Brothers, I learned two other things.One is that these guys get bailed out. The second is that they never go to jail, even when theyxe2x80x99re dead to rights. I think the two people that got prosecuted first after the financial crisis were the two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers. The implosion of those two hedge funds was the canary in the coal mine, because that was the death knell for the coming crash.These two guys had emails back and forth, talking about how fraudulent their products were. Talking about how they're totally screwing over clients, in writing! And not one of them went to jail. And who did they go after at that time? Bernie Madoff. He was the one person who went to jail. Why did he get prosecuted? Because he stole from the rich!TK: They even made a movie about it, starring Robert DeNiroxe2x80xa6SP: Exactly! How come they didn't make any movies about these other horrible people that profited off of the destruction of the economy? The people who ran Countrywide, or the people who were working at the ratings agencies, who knew the things they were rating were fraudulent? Even just down at the mortgage origination level. They made tons of money, and not one of those people went to jail.Anyway, I didnxe2x80x99t go that route. After I got my MBA, I joined the military.TK: Why?SP: My brother at the time had already been out of the Marines for a while. He was working for a hedge fund out in California. And his boss was very, very old, in his nineties. I thought, \"Man, you can literally die at your desk at 100 years old in finance, but there's only a short window that you can serve the nation, and once that, once that door closes, it never opens again.\" So I joined, went to Officer Candidate School, got in, went to other countries, saw a lot of very, very poor places, which gave me some perspective. Long story short, I ended up working as a software engineer.TK: How did you get into online investing? SP: I was still keeping up with all my financial periodicals, because I knew one day I was going to step back into that world. I was able to start making stock picks for myself. The first real investment I made was in Netflix when it was still double digits. I made a brokerage account with my bank and threw some money in there and started going at it.The industry was really changing. Robinhood's slogan is xe2x80x9cDemocratizing Finance,xe2x80x9d but really itxe2x80x99s the computer science industry democratizing finance, because all those tools that used to be proprietary are free now, included in your trading app.If you make a TD Ameritrade account, you can run, think or swim. Itxe2x80x99s like a mini Bloomberg terminal. You're not going to get the same richness of data, but you're going to get a significant amount that you normally wouldn't ten years ago. And in places like wallstreetbets, I was meeting people who clearly used to or still did work on Wall Street, who would teach you, for free, how to do things like recognize distressed companies, research their debt covenants, look up public data about who was invested in what, and so on.Therexe2x80x99s one guy, he goes by the name fuzzy blankeet xe2x80x94 itxe2x80x99s surreal on wallstreetbets, you discuss such serious topics with such ridiculously named people xe2x80x94 who was teaching us how to be distressed debt buyers. These are really intelligent people, just giving away knowledge.A lot of the tools we have now, it used to be only people working at the top hedge funds on Wall Street had access to that information. So a lot of the barriers had collapsed. But the system is still skewed, which I started to see more clearly when the pandemic hit.TK: How so?I remember last March, just as the pandemic was taking hold, I was watching CNBC, and Bill Ackman, the big hedge fund guy, basically saying itxe2x80x99s the end of the American economy. Hexe2x80x99s saying, xe2x80x9cShutdown is inevitable,xe2x80x9d and calling for everything to be closed except essential services:At the time, I was wrapped up in the doom, on the side of, \"I don't think we're prepared for what's coming.\" Because I was watching the videos coming out of China and thinking, \"There are people just passing out. That's not normal. I think that's bad.\" I saw a video of somebody being welded into his apartment, and I again, I thought, that seems bad. Seeing Ackman on TV, I was like, \"I think he's right.\"As time went on, though, that moment bothered me. I thought, xe2x80x9cThat fuck, hexe2x80x99s causing the panic.xe2x80x9dI guarantee a lot of people were like, \"Bill Ackman's a smart dude. He's a lot more successful investor than I am, and he says shit's about to hit the fan. I better start buying some protection. I don't know, short really volatile, high flying stocks, and maybe buy a lot of put spreads.\" But then we all know what happened after that.TK: That broadcast was March 18th, so the $2 trillion bailout was announced a week after. The market had been plummeting straight down, but it bounced right back up and kept going.SP: Itxe2x80x99s the COVID-19 sell-off and pump. Itxe2x80x99s what these guys do. It really does feel as though CNBC is a participant in market manipulation for the rich. These hedge fund guys go on air and itxe2x80x99s like theyxe2x80x99re trying to spook the herd in the direction of their trades. They tell everyone to get out when theyxe2x80x99re short, and once all the meat is all off the bone, they go long, just in time for the recovery. They get to call the top and the bottom of the market. Itxe2x80x99s totally fucked.The bailout and the pandemic just exposed how there are different sets of rules, not just for different types of investors, but different types of businesses. Your favorite sandwich shop? Closed. If you've got 200 of those sandwich shops? Open.If you had sufficient capital to lobby whatever your government is, you could get an exemption, but if you were a small-time business owner, you were out of luck, and that just made no sense to me. I was like, xe2x80x9cWe're just making this up on the fly.xe2x80x9dTK: When did you first pay attention to GameStop?SP: I remember people posting about the GameStop potential short squeeze last summer. I definitely didn't catch any of the attention earlier than that, but I didn't get the trade. I'll be honest with you. I saw the potential there. I really did, but I was like, there's just so much going against you on that. And at the same time, the business needs to make money and they're in debt and they're not making money.But at some point, once this all started, I started to think about it. Wexe2x80x99re in a pandemic, and there are all these people who couldnxe2x80x99t work all year. Or theyxe2x80x99re small businesses that donxe2x80x99t have the political impact. Theyxe2x80x99re going to take the loss. And in the middle of all this misery, you have a group of the most cancerous rent-seekers on earth, aligning to destroy this company GameStop, because they decided it shouldnxe2x80x99t exist anymore.And it was GameStop! Itxe2x80x99s such a visceral symbol for people in my generation. Even for me, in all those bad times growing up, it was always a nice memory just to go to a strip mall, go in the store, check out a game or two. I like GameStop. Everyone remembers going to GameStop. Itxe2x80x99s part of what made it such an obvious rallying cry.That was it for me. I found myself thinking, I didnxe2x80x99t care if I lost every last dollar doing it, I was going to put it on GameStop, just to see them panic for once. Even if for just one moment they have to think about how theyxe2x80x99re going to make their payments for their Manhattan apartments, thatxe2x80x99s worth it. Theyxe2x80x99re playing these games while there are people out there who canxe2x80x99t afford Christmas presents for their kids, canxe2x80x99t afford food. What are these families supposed to do?Meanwhile those guys at the hedge funds, theyxe2x80x99re not sharing that fear. Why should they? Theyxe2x80x99re going to get bailed out anyway.TK: One criticism of the GME traders is that while there are billion-dollar shorts losing on the other side, there are also big money managers on the long side, essentially using what some call xe2x80x9crecreationalxe2x80x9d day-traders as camouflage. What do you say to that?There are definitely some high net worth individuals in wallstreetbets, and they were probably making good money early on, incidentally getting some good research done for free and getting in on some trades early. But there are a lot of small-time investors in there, too. The forum is so big, there's probably a healthy bell curve of every demographic in there now. To say that the forum is made up of people who are just sitting in the basement, and don't really have anything to lose, thatxe2x80x99s not right. A lot of people may not care about the money not because they have too much, but too little. It may be their stimulus check, and theyxe2x80x99re saying, \"Well, I don't have anything anyway. This was my only way to maybe make something, but Ixe2x80x99d rather send a message with it.\"TK: Whatxe2x80x99s Robinhoodxe2x80x99s role?SP: Imagine that Wall Street is a big building, Robinhood is basically letting you into the lobby. The barrier to entry to buying and trading and stocks and options with apps like Robinhood really is very low. What we've discovered in the last ten days, though, is that the pen they built for us does not scale well. Big shocker!It's ironic, for a brokerage that's primarily run by software engineers, that they seem never to have thought about the edge case of millions of people transferring in thousands of dollars in one day, and all buying the same security. I don't think that they really thought about, \"Hey, what if this happens?\"TK: GameStop crested last Thursday, January 28th, when Robinhood and other platforms began restricting trades in GME and other stocks. Robinhood obviously makes its money selling its xe2x80x9corder flowxe2x80x9d to a major high-frequency trader, Citadel, which was likely also the firm that made capital calls on Robinhood during the GME frenzy.A lot of Reddit investors believe Citadel and its billionaire CEO Ken Griffin used those collateral calls to pressure Robinhood into restricting trading in GME. Some press analysts think that explanation is conspiratorial. Whatxe2x80x99s your take?SP: Whether or not they were pressured to kill the rally doesn't matter. The effect was the same. Robinhoodxe2x80x99s restriction killed the rally, a hundred percent. That was the only thing that gave all the firms that had short interests a chance to try to recover. Now, the thing that is really insidious is some retail brokerages that locked out their retail traders, if you had an account with a certain minimum amount of money in it, you could call the customer service line that was reserved for your level of account and they would turn trading back on.So two people using the same trading app could have different market access. Itxe2x80x99s just like we were talking about before. When the GameStop thing started, the shorts were like, xe2x80x9cHey, let's just kill this business because it's a pandemic, they're going to close anyway, let's just destroy it.xe2x80x9d And then, once we started kicking it in the balls, they changed the game and killed the trade. It was like, \"Okay, of course, of course.\"As for the conspiracy charge, it makes me laugh. JP Morgan Chase last fall settled for $920 million or whatever in a case involving spoofing in the metals markets. Before that, they would have said, therexe2x80x99s no such thing as spoofing! Same with manipulation of LIBOR. Once upon a time, if you accused the banks of manipulating LIBOR, theyxe2x80x99d say, xe2x80x9cThatxe2x80x99s a conspiracy theory.xe2x80x9d Then there were settlements and now everyone knows it happened. With these people, it's always a conspiracy until it isn't. Once theyxe2x80x99re found out, it's like, \"Oh, you caught us. You're right. It wasn't a conspiracy. But this other thing, that's a conspiracy. That's not happening.\"TK: What was your reaction to the press coverage of GameStop?SP: The majority of the media that I've seen on WallStreetBets is just incorrect. The stuff that came out really early was trying to label it as a far right-ish type movement, and they got smacked down really hard on that because thatxe2x80x99s the opposite of what happens in there. The forum is not political at all. If you post any political bullshit, that is the fastest way to get banned. Therexe2x80x99s literally a rule, xe2x80x9cNo political bullshit.xe2x80x9d Nobody wants to hear it. Itxe2x80x99s strictly to talk about trades.TK: Whatxe2x80x99s the future of wallstreetbets?SP: I'm fearful of what could happen. The forum is big now. Itxe2x80x99s never going to be ignored again. There are two opposing forces. You have big businesses that are going to try to channel this movement to benefit themselves. But at the same time, you've got a lot of long-time people who've been on there who can sniff out a fraud pretty quickly.Itxe2x80x99s going to be a cat and mouse game. We already see it happening. The biggest one was in silver. Silver is often used as a way for large owners of silver, like in the SLVETF, to cover losses elsewhere. Last week I saw zero advertisements to buy Gamestop stock. Over the weekend, I saw countless news articles and advertisements all over to buy physical bullion. Theyxe2x80x99re saying, xe2x80x9cSilver is going to get pumped. The Reddit crowd is turning to silver.xe2x80x9dTK: Yahoo! had xe2x80x9cSilver Squeeze: How to join the Reddit Bandwagon.xe2x80x9d CNBC had, xe2x80x9cIs Silver the Next GameStop?xe2x80x9d It was like wallstreetbets went Hollywood.SP: I'm like, \"Ixe2x80x99ve got to call bullshit on this.\" Now, if a large institutional owner of an asset was to, I don't know, take out a bunch of ads and hire some people to post on wallstreetbets and maybe hire some botnets through a cut-out, would that be legal? Sounds like a pump and dump to me, but it also sounds difficult to prove. I'm not saying it's happened. I'm saying it's odd, and it's very possible.There's going to be a constant battle to direct the Sauron-like gaze of this board now. Itxe2x80x99s going to be very difficult to get ahead of that, just like it's difficult to know what the number one meme is for next month.TK: Was a message sent in the GameStop story, and if so, what was it?You had a leaderless group rise up and use whatever market power they had, whether it was buying a hundred thousand shares, or one. Some very established traders who trade for themselves frequent those boards. And then you had people who saw the message, they saw the Batman symbol and they rallied to that. You know how many messages I saw in the thread, of people just lining up? It meant something to them. They got to buy a fractional share of the hero's journey.But the trade was destroyed. Whether or not that was intentional is not for me to say. All I can say is what happened. Retail brokerages all of a sudden stopped allowing their clients to trade, unless they were of a certain net worth. Banks could do it. Hedge funds could keep doing it. They could still be in the trade. But you and I could not. We could only sell. We could only do the one thing that they would need us to do, to get themselves out of the quagmire. And it wasn't about price at that point. It was about control of physical shares that would allow you to cover.So yeah, a message got sent. But one was also received. They basically said, xe2x80x9cWe understand the message you're sending. And here's the message we're sending back.xe2x80x9dBut it was worth it.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Matt, I think your story has not been fact-checked properly and the story SP tells is full of holes and probably outright lies. You need to confirm the timeline for SPxe2x80x99s story. It is not coherent.This story purportedly takes place over three decades from 1990ish to 2020.SP states his mother lost everything during the dot.com bust, which reached its lowest point in late 2002. This takes place after his parents divorced. She had moved to a new state after the divorce but before the crash. Apparently, she has the kids. How is this possible? Divorce custody decrees make it very difficult for one parent to move out of state with the children.During this time, SP says his mother had to come home to take care of us kids after working her new dining guide job. How old is he in 2002? How old is his much older brother?The author describes himself as being eight yrs old while working with his dad on laboring jobs. When did this take place? Before or after the divorce? Letxe2x80x99s say it is before, so the date is somewhere in the late 1990s.He says he worked with his dad on his concrete job while 19, which must be sometime before the 2008 crash. Letxe2x80x99s say itxe2x80x99s 2007. That makes SP 8yrs old in 2006 and then 14 in 2002 during the dot.com bust. His brother is already in the military by his account and wouldnxe2x80x99t need mom. SP also says he talked to his older brother and father several times a day for 15-20 yrs, but for the last 5, not really at all to his father. This means he regularly talked to his father on the phone from 1995 or 2000 until 2015. Why would he be talking to his father and/or brother on the phone while he was living with his father pre-divorce and while he was working concrete with him at age 19? Why is he calling his brother while he is living with him post-divorce. How could he be talking to his brother several times a day during his brotherxe2x80x99s tours in Iraq, which had already been completed by 2007ish when his brother counseled him to go to college?SP said he worked his way thru college, which must be around 2007-11 during the 2008 crash. Then he went to an MBA program. Then had five roommates for four years to pay it off, which brings us to 2015ish. Then he says he joined the Officer Candidate School and, served the country. For how long? Then he became a software engineer, but kept an eye on trading. During these last five years, SP says he got married and had a second child, which his father didnxe2x80x99t know about. How can he do all of that in the time specified? How does he start trading while a poor undergraduate during the 2008 crash? How can he know so many Wall St. traders during this time? What does he do for the four years he had five roommates? Why would he need five roommates if he was successfully trading? Why is he talking to his father several times a days during and after the 2008 crash, but not after 2015? The story does not add up. Some or all of it is bullshit. Sorry, but I think youxe2x80x99ve been conned.Love this, Matt. Thank you. My husband and I went to Occupy Wall Street. One night during it we were invited to dinner at a restaurant uptown. Some WS people were there, all talking about how important it was for the government to bail them out. They had no interest in Occupy WallStreet or how the protestors felt or what so many people had lost. I've since seen the same contempt over and over again in the elites (most recently John Kerry and Gavin Newsom). They have contempt for people who have hopes and dreams in their own small businesses or middle and working class homes, life and family, or who are proud to work with their hands. I saw such emptiness in these WS people. They saw the world as winners (them, because not caring about what they invested in, just the profit made them invulnerable) - and losers (anyone who put their heart and soul into what they did and invested in, which made them vulnerable).No posts","title":"\"This is for you, Dad\": Interview with an Anonymous GameStop Investor - TK News by Matt Taibbi","url":"https://taibbi.substack.com/p/this-is-for-you-dad-interview-with"}

Unsurprisingly, and thankfully, the bookxe2x80x99s publisher received a flood of orders, and the hardcover edition is sold out, which has resulted in some confusion. As it stands, if you go on Amazon, the hardcover is on sale for the absurd price of $100, while the paperback edition is available at the correct cost, but will not ship out of Amazon until February 18th. That February 18th release will be of an updated paperback edition that includes a new chapter, looking back at the Trump years. Ixe2x80x99ll be posting an excerpt of that new material here in the next week, along with a video wexe2x80x99ve produced for TK subscribers. Unfortunately, the only way to order a copy of the book right now xe2x80x94 at least until later in February xe2x80x94 is to order directly from OR Books. By way of apology for any inconvenience this has caused either to subscribers of this site or fans of the JRE Experience, the publisher is offering a 25% discount code for anyone seeing this announcement. February 3rd 2021The Trump era played out like a hyperbolic parody of Hate Inc., as the last four years saw wild contradictions in media. Some companies, particularly cable stations, made record profits during a period that will be remembered as a financial boom time for some. However, journalists overall got clobbered, with local news especially shedding jobs at a horrific rate. Trust in the press also dropped precipitously, thanks among other things to a mind-blowing quantity of scandals and factual fiascoes. The new edition delves into these issues, asking how the Trump era accelerated the divisiveness industry, and what some of the consequences of this might have been. Again, Ixe2x80x99ll have an excerpt up here soon, along with other materials. In the meantime, thanks for your patience, and for those just looking for a place to buy the book, apologies again for the confusion.

In the past few weeks, Ixe2x80x99ve read Hate Inc (via audiobook) and was stunned to find another liberal whose take on the modern political conversation is so close to the things Ixe2x80x99ve been screaming at MSNBC and the New York Times that somehow make all my liberal friends think Ixe2x80x99m a Trump supporter.

Short-selling hedge funds, smelling blood as the global economy cratered, loaded up with bets against finance stocks, pouring downward pressure on teetering, hyper-leveraged firms like Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. The free-market purists at the banks begged the government to stop the music, and when the S.E.C. complied with a ban on financial short sales, conventional wisdom let out a cheer. \"This will absolutely make a difference,\" economist Peter Cardillo told CNN. \"Now, if there is any good news, shorts will have to cover.xe2x80x9dAt the time, poor beleaguered banks were victims, while hedge funds betting them down as the economy circled the drain were seen as antisocial monsters. xe2x80x9cThey are like looters after a hurricane,xe2x80x9d seethed Andrew Cuomo, then-Attorney General of New York State, who xe2x80x9cpromised to intensify investigations into short selling abuses.xe2x80x9d Senator John McCain, in the home stretch of his eventual landslide loss to Barack Obama, added that S.E.C. chairman Christopher Cox had xe2x80x9cbetrayed the publicxe2x80x99s trustxe2x80x9d by allowing xe2x80x9cspeculators and hedge fundsxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9cturn our markets into a casino.xe2x80x9d Fast forward thirteen years. The day-trading followers of a two-million-subscriber Reddit forum called xe2x80x9cwallstreetbetsxe2x80x9d somewhat randomly decide to keep short-sellers from laying waste to a brick-and-mortar retail video game company called GameStop, betting it up in defiance of the Street. Worth just $6 four months ago, the stock went from $18.36 on the afternoon of the Capitol riot, to $43.03 on the 21st two weeks later, to $147.98 this past Tuesday the 26th, to an incredible $347.51 at the close of the next day, January 27th. The rally sent crushing losses at short-selling hedge funds like Melvin Capital, which was forced to close out its position at a cost of nearly $3 billion. Just like 2008, down-bettors got smashed, only this time, there were no quotes from economists celebrating the xe2x80x9cgood newsxe2x80x9d that shorts had to cover. Instead, polite society was united in its horror at the spectacle of amateur gamblers doing to hotshot finance professionals what those market pros routinely do to everyone else. If youxe2x80x99ve ever seen Animal House, you understand the sentiment:The press conveyed panic and moral disgust. xe2x80x9cI didnxe2x80x99t realize it was this cultlike,xe2x80x9d said short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, without irony denouncing the campaign against firms like his as xe2x80x9cjust a get rich quick scheme.xe2x80x9d Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin said the Redditor campaign had xe2x80x9cno basis in reality,xe2x80x9d while Dr. Michael Burry, the hedge funder whose bets against subprime mortgages were lionized in xe2x80x9cThe Big Short,xe2x80x9d called the amateur squeeze xe2x80x9cunnatural, insane, and dangerous.xe2x80x9dThe episode prompted calls to regulate Reddit and, finally, halt action on the disputed stocks. As I write this, word has come out that platforms like Robinhood and TD Ameritrade are curbing trading in GameStop and several other companies, including Nokia and AMC Entertainment holdings.Meaning: just like 2008, trading was shut down to save the hides of erstwhile high priests of xe2x80x9ccreative destruction.xe2x80x9d Also just like 2008, there are calls for the government to investigate the people deemed responsible for unapproved market losses. The acting head of the SEC said the agency was xe2x80x9cmonitoringxe2x80x9d the situation, while the former head of its office of Internet enforcement, John Stark, said, xe2x80x9cI canxe2x80x99t imagine there isnxe2x80x99t an open investigation and probably a formal order to find out whoxe2x80x99s on these message boards.xe2x80x9d Georgetown finance professor James Angel lamented, xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s going to be hard for the SEC to find blatant manipulation,xe2x80x9d but they xe2x80x9cowe it to look.xe2x80x9d The Washington Post elaborated:To establish manipulation that runs afoul of securities laws, Angel said regulators would need to prove traders engaged in xe2x80x9can intentional act to push a price away from its fundamental value to seek a profit.xe2x80x9d In market parlance, this is typically known as a pump-and-dump schemexe2x80xa6Even Nancy Pelosi, when asked about xe2x80x9cmanipulationxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cwhatxe2x80x99s going on on Wall Street right now,xe2x80x9d said xe2x80x9cwexe2x80x99ll all be reviewing it,xe2x80x9d as if it were the business of congress to worry about a bunch of day traders cashing in for once. The only thing xe2x80x9cdangerousxe2x80x9d about a gang of Reddit investors blowing up hedge funds is that some of us reading about it might die of laughter. That bit about investigating this as a xe2x80x9cpump and dump schemexe2x80x9d to push prices away from their xe2x80x9cfundamental valuexe2x80x9d is particularly hilarious. What does the Washington Post think the entire stock market is, in the bailout age?Americaxe2x80x99s banks just had maybe their best year ever, raking in $125 billion in underwriting fees at a time when the rest of the country is dealing with record unemployment, thanks entirely to massive Federal Reserve intervention that turned a crash into a boom. Who thinks the xe2x80x9cfundamental valuexe2x80x9d of most stocks would be this high, absent the Fedxe2x80x99s Atlas-like support in the last year?For context, Goldman, Sachs posted revenues of $44.56 billion in 2020, its best year since 2009, a.k.a. the last year Wall Street cashed in on a bailout. Back then, the shortcut back to giganto-bonuses was underwriting fees for financial companies raising money to purge themselves of TARP debt. This time itxe2x80x99s underwriting fees for bond issues and IPOs. The subtext of both bailouts was that anyone who owned or underwrote financial assets got richer, while everyone else got the proverbial high hat. Itxe2x80x99s no accident that income inequality dramatically accelerated after the last bailouts, and that the only people to see net gains in wealth since 2008 have been the richest 20% of Americans, a pattern almost certain to continue. The constant in the bailout years has been a battery of artificial stimulants sent through the financial sector, from the TARP to years of zero-interest-rate policies (ZIRP) to outright interventions like the multiple trillion-dollar rounds of Quantitative Easing. All that froth allowed finance companies to suck out hundreds of billions in fees, encouraged lunatic risk-taking in every direction and rampages of private equity takeovers, and kept a vast stable of functionally dead companies alive on cheap credit.Those so-called xe2x80x9czombie companiesxe2x80x9d make up roughly 30% of all corporations in America now, and they racked up over a trillion dollars in new debt since the pandemic alone. While policymakers may have stabilized the economy with the bailouts, they may also xe2x80x9cinadvertently be directing the flow of capital to unproductive firms,xe2x80x9d as Bloomberg euphemistically put it back in November.In other words, it was all well and good for investment banks and executives of phoney-baloney companies to gorge themselves on funhouse profits on a funhouse economy, but when amateurs decided to funnel just a bit of this clown show into their own pockets, finance pros wailed like the grave of Adam Smith had been danced upon. The worst was Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who issued a somber warning that those behind the recent market frenzy are xe2x80x9cin for a very rude awakening,xe2x80x9d adding, xe2x80x9cI donxe2x80x99t know if it is going to happen tomorrow, next week or in a month, but it will happen.xe2x80x9dThis is the same James Gorman whose company just saw its 2020 fourth-quarter profits go up 51% versus the year before, with total revenues up 16% to $48.2 billion, matching almost exactly the 16% rise in the stock market last year. If youxe2x80x99re going to rake in $33 million as Gorman did last year captaining a firm that just siphoned off billions in essentially risk-free profits underwriting a never-ending bailout, should you really be worrying about someone else getting a xe2x80x9crude awakeningxe2x80x9d? There are 19 million people collecting unemployment who might be reading those profit numbers. Does this man know how to spell xe2x80x9cpitchforkxe2x80x9d?GameStop has prompted more pearl-clutching than any news story in recent memory. Expert after grave-faced expert has marched on TV to tell Reddit traders that markets are complicated, this isnxe2x80x99t a game, and they wouldnxe2x80x99t be doing this, if they really understood how things work.xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m not sure everybody fully understands whatxe2x80x99s happening here,xe2x80x9d was the melancholy comment on CNBC of Wall Streetxe2x80x99s famed fluffer-in-chief, Andrew Ross Sorkin. The author of Too Big to Fail added in pedagogic tones that while this xe2x80x9cstick it to the man momentxe2x80x9d might feel good, betting up the value of GameStop above Delta Airlines just isnxe2x80x99t right, because xe2x80x9cthere are no fundamentals herexe2x80x9d:Fundamentals? How much does Sorkin think his exalted Delta Airlines would be worth now, if the Fed hadnxe2x80x99t stopped its death plunge last March? How much would any of the airlines be worth in the Covid age, with their fleets of mothballed jets? What a joke!Furthermore, everybody xe2x80x9cunderstandsxe2x80x9d what happened with GameStop. Unlike some other Wall Street stories, this one isnxe2x80x99t complicated. The entire tale, in a nutshell, goes like this. One group of gamblers announced, xe2x80x9cFuck you!xe2x80x9d Another group announced back: xe2x80x9cNo, fuck YOU!xe2x80x9dThatxe2x80x99s it. Or, as one market analyst put it to me this morning, xe2x80x9cA bunch of guys made a bet, got killed, then doubled and tripled down and got killed even more.xe2x80x9dRegarding improprieties, leaving aside that the Redditors were doing exactly what billion-dollar hedge funds do every day xe2x80x94 colluding to move a stock for fun and profit xe2x80x94 the notion that this should be the subject of a federal investigation is preposterous.Is it completely outside the realm of possibility that the GME fiasco isnxe2x80x99t just day traders giving the finger to Wall Street, that xe2x80x9cmajor playersxe2x80x9d are behind the stockxe2x80x99s movement, in an illegal manipulation scheme? No. Probably itxe2x80x99s not that, but it could be, just as some of the usual suspects may have piled on the long side once the frenzy started. But if therexe2x80x99s anything to investigate here, the obvious place to start is with the hedge funds and their brokers. While it isnxe2x80x99t a complicated story, some of the awesome humor of GameStop is in the mechanics.Unlike betting on a stock to go up (i.e. betting xe2x80x9clongxe2x80x9d), where you can only lose as much as you invest, the losses in shorting can be infinite. This adds a potential extra layer of Schadenfreude to the plight of the happy hedge fund pirate who might have borrowed gazillions of GameStop shares at five or ten hoping to tank the firm, only to go in pucker mode as Internet hordes drive the cost of the trade to ten, twenty, fifty times their original investment.Short-sellers bet by borrowing shares from so-called prime brokers (Goldman, Sachs and JP Morgan Chase are among the biggest), selling them, and waiting for the price to drop, at which point they buy them back on the open market at the lower price and return them. The commonly understood rub is that prime brokers donxe2x80x99t always really procure those original borrowed shares, and often give out more xe2x80x9clocatesxe2x80x9d than they should, putting more shares in circulation than actually exist (as in this case). GameStop is exposing this systematic plundering of firms using phantom shares and locates, by groups of actors who now have the gall to complain that theyxe2x80x99re the victims of a xe2x80x9cget rich quickxe2x80x9d scheme. Short-sellers are not inherently antisocial. They can be beneficial to society, instrumental in rooting out corruption and waste in whole sectors like the subprime industry, or in single companies like Enron. Moreover, the wiping out of such funds isnxe2x80x99t necessarily to be cheered. Sorkin correctly notes that many hedge funds invest on behalf of entities like pension funds, though maybe they shouldnxe2x80x99t, given their high cost and relatively mediocre performance, as Ixe2x80x99ve noted before.However, thatxe2x80x99s the point. The degree to which even the beneficial functions of short-sellers are cheered or not is dependent upon whose corruption theyxe2x80x99re uncovering. Let the record show that when the S.E.C. imposed a ban on shorts of financial stocks in 2008, they routed short-sellers who were dead right about the insolubility of Americaxe2x80x99s banking sector. The state prevented their correct judgment about companies like Wachovia and Washington Mutual, whose stocks kept plunging even after the ban and went bust soon after. The shorts were right about all the other banks, too. The Inspector General of the TARP, Neil Barofsky, eventually told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that 12 of the 13 biggest banks were on the brink of failure when they got saved xe2x80x94 by the short ban, by emergency overnight grants of commercial bank licenses to companies that werenxe2x80x99t commercial banks, by the bailouts, by the subsequent avalanche of underwriting fees, and most of all, by the lies about all of the above.The home of James xe2x80x9crude awakeningxe2x80x9d Gorman, Morgan Stanley, got its bank holding company license (and the lifesaving Fed credit lines that came with it) late on a Sunday night in September, 2008, because the firm couldnxe2x80x99t have opened its doors without it the next Monday morning. Theyxe2x80x99d have been blown to bits, by xe2x80x9cfundamentals.xe2x80x9d Instead, they got rescued, given a forever pass to keep feeding at the neck of society while claiming, falsely, to be not-failures and not-welfare recipients, better somehow than the xe2x80x9cdumb moneyxe2x80x9d they think should be theirs alone to manage. The rank selectivity of this makes any moral argument against the GameStop revolt moot. Therexe2x80x99s no legitimate cause here, just an assertion of exclusive rights to plunder, which will doubtless be exercised now in the form of bans, investigations, and increased barriers to market entry. Probably also, in the political spirit of our times, there will some form of speech crackdown on platforms like Reddit, to protect us from the mob.About that: there are many making hay of a description found on a Subreddit, to the effect that wallstreetbets is xe2x80x9clike 4Chan found a Bloomberg terminal.xe2x80x9d A columnist at the Guardian, settling into the rhetorical line sure to find acceptance among the wine-and-MSNBC crowd, admitted to finding the rampaging-id dynamic on 4chan funny as a young person, but strange now to xe2x80x9cwitness a brief and regretful adolescent occupation re-emerge as a prominent cultural force.xe2x80x9d The author wanted to admit to laughing at this xe2x80x9cintentionally senselessxe2x80x9d behavior, but ultimately decried the xe2x80x9ctransgressive attitudesxe2x80x9d of the Redditors.This is where society will ultimately come down, of course, uniting to denounce $GME as financial Trumpism, even though it actually comes closer to being an updated and superior version of Occupy Wall Street. Itxe2x80x99s likely not any evil manipulation scheme, but ordinary people acting xe2x80x94 out of self-interest, but also out of sheer enthusiasm for one of the best reasons to do just about anything, because you can xe2x80x94 on a few simple, powerful observations. Theyxe2x80x99ve seen first that our markets are basically fake, set up to artificially accelerate the wealth divide, and not in their favor. Secondly they see that the stock market, like the ballot box, remains one of the only places where sheer numbers still matter more than capital or connections. And theyxe2x80x99re piling on, and itxe2x80x99s delicious, not so much because theyxe2x80x99re right, but because the people running for cover are so wrong, and still canxe2x80x99t admit it.Buy the ticket, take the ride, nitwits.

At the Capitol, a pro-Trump mob tried to burst into the building, and a police officer who attempted to intercede was caught in a door. He cried out in pain, but the crowd was indifferent, chanting, xe2x80x9cHeave, ho!xe2x80x9d as they tried to break in. Farina, in the middle of the physical mayhem as photojournalists often are, caught the scene up close while 30,000 people watched the live feed.  Farinaxe2x80x99s footage rocketed around the world, and major press outlets celebrated his work as an example of hard-hitting reporting. CNN did a laudatory story about the freelance photojournalist, with Pamela Brown asking Farina to xe2x80x9cbring us inside the mayhem.xe2x80x9d Other outlets like USA Today quoted his recollections of that day, and the likes of Steven Colbert on CBS, as well as ABC News, NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, the Guardian, the Wall Street Journal, CNN, the New York Post, the Daily Mail, and others used it as fodder for outraged coverage of the riot:For a week or so, Status Coup was feted for service on the front lines of responsible journalism. Nearly two weeks later, on January 18th, another Farina live stream was shut down by YouTube, thanks to policies that will make it very difficult for non-corporate media going forward to do live reporting. In fact, itxe2x80x99s not a stretch to say that if the incident from the 18th happened earlier, we may never have gotten the Capitol pictures.  On the 18th, Farina was in Richmond, Virginia, where a significant rally of pro-gun protesters was expected. There had been widespread reports warning of unrest. CBS relayed FBI fears of xe2x80x9ccredible threats of violence,xe2x80x9d while the Washington Post said officials were xe2x80x9con edgexe2x80x9d ahead of the Martin Luther King Day protest, gearing up for a full-scale assault: Members of the National Guard are on standby. Plywood covers the windows of the State Capitol. Tall metal barricades surround Capitol Square, with police vehicles idling on pathways just inside locked pedestrian gates. Downtown streets will be closed; signs warning against carrying guns have gone up around the city.xe2x80x9cThe violent, lawless insurrection and assault on democracy and its institutions that unfolded last week in Washington, D.C., will not be tolerated in the city of Richmond,xe2x80x9d Mayor Levar Stoney warned on Thursday.The threats may have been credible, but when Farina began live-streaming to an audience of 6,000, the event turned out to be peaceful and unremarkable, though not without interest from a news perspective. xe2x80x9cFrankly, there might have been more press than protesters,xe2x80x9d Status Coupxe2x80x99s Chariton said later. xe2x80x9cAnd while it was live, it was pretty informative. Jon talked to 4-5 people, and they pretty much all made it clear that they werenxe2x80x99t Trump supporters, that they didnxe2x80x99t support what happened in the Capitol. They were pretty relaxed compared to the propaganda ahead of time.xe2x80x9dDespite the seeming unremarkableness of the event, it shut down abruptly mid-feed. Chariton assumed something happened on Farinaxe2x80x99s end. xe2x80x9cThen I got an email from YouTube, telling me wexe2x80x99d violated their xe2x80x98Firearms Policy.xe2x80x99 I wasnxe2x80x99t aware they had a firearms policy.xe2x80x9d January 18th 2021Chariton went onto Twitter to announce what happened, and after a few well-known media figures like Krystal Ball and Ryan Grim complained, YouTube restored the content. Other independents covering the rally, however, like Andrew Kimmel, never had their content restored. The serious consequence of the Virginia episode was not so much the lost coverage of the rally, but what Chariton had to tell Farina after the event. Well-known for covering labor issues, homelessness, and especially the Flint water crisis, Status Coup had been growing, in large part because of live stream content. Now, however, the possibility that YouTube might issue a strike against his channel, or take it down altogether, forced him into a difficult decision. xe2x80x9cI had to tell [Farina] not to go live anymore,xe2x80x9d he says. One person at the same rally wasnxe2x80x99t surprised by what happened. Videographer and well-known protest shooter Ford Fischer of News2Share, the first profile subject of xe2x80x9cMeet the Censored,xe2x80x9d was also in Richmond to shoot the event. He didnxe2x80x99t get taken down by YouTube, but only because he didnxe2x80x99t bother trying to go live. xe2x80x9cI was there on January 18th and didnxe2x80x99t stream it, because I knew itxe2x80x99d get banned,xe2x80x9d Fischer says. xe2x80x9cI filmed basically the same rally on January 17th and it did get banned.xe2x80x9dThe January 17th rally Fischer referenced was a pro-gun rally in Columbus, Ohio, that in the wake of the Capitol riot garnered significant advance media coverage. Once again, headlines like xe2x80x9cFBI warns of Potential Boogaloo Violence During January 17th Ralliesxe2x80x9d primed audiences to expect the worst, and also to make a direct connection with the January 6th events. In fact, Twitter cited the coming Ohio rally in its post announcing the closure of Donald Trumpxe2x80x99s account, describing the Ohio event as a possible xe2x80x9csecondary attackxe2x80x9d:Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. According to Fischer, the Twitter announcement didnxe2x80x99t exactly make sense, because the protesters in Ohio were more of a libertarian ilk, and, as Farina and Chariton discovered in the Virginia crowd, not so clearly aligned with Trump as Twitter and other media outlets may have imagined. Fischer has frequently covered events involving the gun-toting Boogaloos, whom he describes as anti-authoritarian and less likely to be Trumpists than to profess a pox-on-both-houses attitude to Trump and Joe Biden both (xe2x80x9cYou might hear something like, xe2x80x98Unless you put Ron Paul on the ballot, Ixe2x80x99m not voting,xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d he says).Although therexe2x80x99s significant national interest in the group, both among supporters and detractors, Fischer says xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99ve basically stopped trying to live stream rallies involving Boogaloos.xe2x80x9d Back on July 4th, 2020, he shot a live stream of a joint armed rally of Boogaloos and Black Lives Matter, protesting together against police violence xe2x80x94 here again, we see the significant political differences between Trump supporters and some of these pro-gun groups xe2x80x94 only to have the live stream interrupted, on the same grounds that it violated Googlexe2x80x99s firearms policy. Nonetheless, Fischer attempted to shoot the January 17th rally, among other things because of the obvious public interest in the event, which was heavily covered by the mainstream press. Local TV affiliates associated with networks like ABC and CNN covered the January 17th rallies in Columbus and in other locations, even broadcasting live. However, when Fischer tried to live stream, he was cut off in short order by a notice identical to the one received by Chariton. He was reminded that YouTube xe2x80x9cdoes not allow live streams showing someone holding, handling, or transporting a firearm.xe2x80x9dThe policy presents obvious head-scratching issues. For one, as Fischer points out, virtually all police carry a firearm, so xe2x80x9ctherexe2x80x99s obviously some subjectivity in whatxe2x80x99s being enforced.xe2x80x9d Furthermore, the rule doesnxe2x80x99t seem to apply to major corporate outlets, a double-standard problem thatxe2x80x99s a constant in this universe.In an even more bizarre recent incident, YouTube this past weekend removed video Fischer shot on January 6th xe2x80x94 not live footage, but still xe2x80x94 of the crowd listening to Donald Trump before the Capitol riot. This time, the grounds were that the content advanced xe2x80x9cfalse claims that widespread fraud errors or glitches affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.xe2x80x9dFischer supposes the issue has to do with the fact that the unedited, single-shot video xe2x80x94 which is focused mainly on the crowd reaction xe2x80x94 caught Trumpxe2x80x99s own words. This might make sense, except that Trumpxe2x80x99s speech that day is still on YouTube, as broadcast by several CBS affiliates, among others. As with Farina, Fischerxe2x80x99s Capitol protest footage was picked up by numerous major outlets, including CNN, NBC, CBS, BBC, and others, but the system seems to incentivize independent shooters to distribute footage through corporate outlets only, rather than conveying directly to their own audiences.  xe2x80x9cI absolutely think therexe2x80x99s a campaign against independent content creators, especially live,xe2x80x9d Fischer says. xe2x80x9cMajor outlets face no such technical issues.xe2x80x9dThis makes any attempt to build an alternative news outlet a steep uphill climb, even when therexe2x80x99s a positive audience response, as Chariton has found out. Formerly with The Young Turks, Charitonxe2x80x99s niche is national news from a left/progressive perspective, with special emphasis on the area where corporate outlets once had a near-monopoly, e.g. on-location production of images and reporting.Typically, alternative media outlets canxe2x80x99t afford to travel much and often have to rely on wire services and commercial coverage for primary source material, especially for expensive beats like the presidential election. Chariton emphasizes going to hot spots like Flint and to election campaign events to generate original images and video interviews, an innovative alt-media take on national news coverage. Live stream coverage had been a major part of their formula.The Ohio and Virginia incidents underscore two developments involving platforms like YouTube/Google, Facebook, and Twitter in recent years. The first is the campaign to stress what Google calls xe2x80x9cauthoritative content,xe2x80x9d which up-ranks articles and videos issued by major corporate news outlets like CNN or CBS, while decreasing traffic for independent sites on the left, the right, and in between. The second has been an effort to close loopholes in the platformsxe2x80x99 content moderation regimes. In the wake of the Capitol riot, this trend intensified. After the xe2x80x9cinsurrection,xe2x80x9d a series of trial-balloon stories appeared in the press, suggesting that Internet nooks and crannies where conspiracy theory and misinformation proliferate might need more aggressive cleaning.The AP warned that xe2x80x9cApple and Google, among others, have left open a major loophole for this material: Podcasts.xe2x80x9d The New York Times meanwhile reported on an exodus of millions of users who, fearing a Big Tech crackdown, jumped to encyrpted sites like Signal and Telegram.The Times quoted the head of the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, Louis Grever, as saying such sites allow xe2x80x9cgroups that have an ill intent to plan behind the curtain.xe2x80x9d Noting the situation xe2x80x9cworried U.S. authorities,xe2x80x9d the piece suggested the migration might xe2x80x9cinflame the debatexe2x80x9d over encryption. Podcasts, encrypted apps: how about live programming? Pundits had long worried that live stream capability was allowing the broadcast of violence and hate speech. In the hands of alternative media, however, the tool posed another problem, in the form of simply showing offensive reality.In the cases of people like Fischer and Chariton, however, itxe2x80x99s unclear how platforms like YouTube understand the documentation of political demonstrations. If you film a neo-Nazi running his mouth, should you be banned for covering his hate speech? If you show a gun-rights activist carrying a gun, are you yourself engaging in pro-gun activism? For independent outlets like Status Coup, these questions pose a serious problem. Because theyxe2x80x99re dependent financially on platforms like YouTube to reach subscribers, they canxe2x80x99t afford to take the risk of being shut down. But how can alternative media operate if it doesnxe2x80x99t know exactly where the lines are? Also, how can such outlets add value when its one advantage over corporate media xe2x80x94 flexibility, and willingness to cover topics outside the mainstream xe2x80x94 is limited by the fear of consequences from making independent-minded editorial decisions?xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s pretty horrible,xe2x80x9d Chariton said, xe2x80x9cif we have to consider not doing our jobs, out of fear that YouTube is going to remove our content, or remove our channel without warning (like theyxe2x80x99ve begun doing to other, smaller channels).\"The standard response to complaints about incidents like this is that YouTube and Google are private companies, and no one has a right to a platform on a private space. Chariton acknowledges this and concedes there are alternative platforms, like Rokfin, a video-sharing alternative to YouTube. For the foreseeable future anyway, however, it would be nearly impossible to build a successful alternative video-based channel without the assent of the small handful of major tech platforms that dominate media. xe2x80x9cPeople live on YouTube and Facebook,xe2x80x9d is how Chariton puts it.I asked him a few more questions about the future of live content, and what happened on January 18th:TK: How has the ability to produce live content affected your business? JC: Status Coup was up 20,000 subscribers since November, in large part because we were covering stories like the xe2x80x9cStop the Stealxe2x80x9d movement and other issues related to the election. Ixe2x80x99d say 95% of that content was live content. Wexe2x80x99ve done a lot of stuff, from coverage of GMxe2x80x99s decision to lay off 15,000 workers to the epidemic of homelessness in Seattle, to repeated reporting trips in Flint covering the ongoing water crisis. Itxe2x80x99s a major part of the business. It costs two to three grand for us to take a trip somewhere, and itxe2x80x99s already tight, but if wexe2x80x99re restricted in any way from doing live, thatxe2x80x99s a blow because it brings in a significant amount of our revenue (which we need to then fund future in-the-field reporting trips).TK: What happened in Virginia to affect your decision-making about live content going forward? JC: I had to tell my cameraman not to go livexe2x80xa6 Theyxe2x80x99ve already shown theyxe2x80x99re willing to take down some outlets entirely, without warning. The email YouTube sent me, I felt they could consider that a warning, and the next time, they could either give us a copyright strike, or remove us. I just canxe2x80x99t afford to take that risk. TK: Do you see this as part of a wider effort to close informational loopholes at these platforms?JC: Itxe2x80x99s already documented that YouTube has been hiding independent channels in a cave, while elevating xe2x80x9cauthoritativexe2x80x9d channels like xe2x80x94 according to YouTube xe2x80x94 CNN and Fox News. Thatxe2x80x99s Silicon Valley basically just saying outright, xe2x80x9cWexe2x80x99re elevating some sources at the expense of othersxe2x80xa6xe2x80x9d Unless youxe2x80x99re a major outlet that has a line to YouTube, you donxe2x80x99t have any way of clearing up these episodes. Itxe2x80x99s easier to talk to someone at the CIA than it is to actually reach a human being at YouTube.  TK: What are the implications of an incident like this for alternative media? JC: First of all, itxe2x80x99s worth pointing out, the only reason my content was restored is that I threw a shit-fit on Twitter, and people like Krystal Ball and Ryan Grim complained. But people like Andrew Kimmel did not have their content restored, proving therexe2x80x99s basically no rhyme or reason to this. Itxe2x80x99s arbitrary. Wexe2x80x99ve come to a place where youxe2x80x99d almost have to clear your decisions with YouTube ahead of time to feel completely safe. I understand, there must be some limits. If someone like Alex Jones is saying, xe2x80x9cGo get your guns, get out there,xe2x80x9d thatxe2x80x99s really dangerous.But this, this is beyond a slippery slope. Itxe2x80x99s a cliff. If they start pulling live streams or issuing strikes like this, itxe2x80x99s basically a death sentence for outlets like ours.  For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.I'm reminded of Thomas Paine's quote, \"He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself.\"This was more or less the moral linchpin that drove the evolution of American civil rights from the founding of the nation with the Declaration of Independence. One could write American history as a long slog from a group of elitist merchants and planters to all common white men, then extended to immigrants, then Catholics, then African Americans and the freed slaves (even mostly in theory initially), to women's enfranchisement of the 1920s, to the 1960s Civil Rights movement, then the gays and lesbians movement, and so forth. There's clear honesty to the dedication of this principle in American liberalism and how it justifies the course of our history and approach to the future, and by sticking to it no matter the disagreements, it did deliver tremendous rewards and greater freedoms for more people.But what we have been seeing recently is a clear retreat from this principle, ironically on groups of \"justice\" and \"fairness\" and \"equity.\" And we're seeing this manifest itself very strongly in the recent attacks of free speech, which was traditionally the most sacred of American beliefs. I like to think that for most of American history there was an acknowledgement that if you restricted people's access to free speech, you only opened up yourself to a whole new set of abuses of civil rights and individual free-will. Our history certainly shows this - the severe prejudices against American blacks in the past, the McCarthyism anti-communism paranoia of the 1950s, the periodic attempts of religious evangelicals to impose their morality on the American public. However, this new marriage between Silicon Valley and progressive Democrats has resulted in a hegemony that finds it acceptable to severely restrict access to \"undesirable\" speech. While there is a certain sympathy to this idea, after all, we don't like neo-Nazis running amok, but a) who determines what is undesirable and not? and b) in real life it's only resulted in double standards, which is what always happens when you violate Paine's principle. Upon what principle can you ban Parler but not other communication forums? Maybe you argue that Parler was responsible (somehow) for the Capitol riot. But what about twitter and Facebook during the BLM riots of 2020? Many people used those sources to organize the protests and even coordinate riots, along with expressing violent thoughts as well as support for the riots and antifa protests. True, the Silicon Valley platforms are privately owned. But there is no public sphere equivalent of these platforms. I don't pretend to have a clear cut answer to how to reconcile the sphere of privately owned platforms with that they are predominately treated and accepted by the public as an extension of public space and an extension of our free will and free speech. There was a period in the late 1980s/1990s when free speech advocates (all lefties, of course), were arguing that shopping malls had become de facto public spaces because so many Americans now lived in suburban areas with no real public space. It's more or less the same argument but on a much bigger and problematic scale.Nonetheless, we now easily see how by establishing a clear precedence for only one accepted standard by a handful of companies that control, what, 95+% of the online access, we have a hegemony that treats one set of violence as acceptable and even part of civic democracy, the 2020 protests, while another set of violence, the Capitol attack, is treated as a wave of fascism that must be defeated at all costs (even of the latter was primarily a bunch of crazy boys running amok for a few hours, while the former caused billions in damage to public and private property and multiple deaths in cities across America - but let's leave that aside for now).Whenever a double standard emerges from treating beliefs and ideas and principles differently, hypocrisy always emerges. And one of the tragedies of that hypocrisy is when the hypocritical class tries to hide from their hypocrisy through being \"fair\" in utterly arbitrary actions affecting innocent bystanders, like these film producers.

At the Capitol, a pro-Trump mob tried to burst into the building, and a police officer who attempted to intercede was caught in a door. He cried out in pain, but the crowd was indifferent, chanting, xe2x80x9cHeave, ho!xe2x80x9d as they tried to break in. Farina, in the middle of the physical mayhem as photojournalists often are, caught the scene up close while 30,000 people watched the live feed.  Farinaxe2x80x99s footage rocketed around the world, and major press outlets celebrated his work as an example of hard-hitting reporting. CNN did a laudatory story about the freelance photojournalist, with Pamela Brown asking Farina to xe2x80x9cbring us inside the mayhem.xe2x80x9d Other outlets like USA Today quoted his recollections of that day, and the likes of Steven Colbert on CBS, as well as ABC News, NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, the Guardian, the Wall Street Journal, CNN, the New York Post, the Daily Mail, and others used it as fodder for outraged coverage of the riot:For a week or so, Status Coup was feted for service on the front lines of responsible journalism. Nearly two weeks later, on January 18th, another Farina live stream was shut down by YouTube, thanks to policies that will make it very difficult for non-corporate media going forward to do live reporting. In fact, itxe2x80x99s not a stretch to say that if the incident from the 18th happened earlier, we may never have gotten the Capitol pictures.  On the 18th, Farina was in Richmond, Virginia, where a significant rally of pro-gun protesters was expected. There had been widespread reports warning of unrest. CBS relayed FBI fears of xe2x80x9ccredible threats of violence,xe2x80x9d while the Washington Post said officials were xe2x80x9con edgexe2x80x9d ahead of the Martin Luther King Day protest, gearing up for a full-scale assault: Members of the National Guard are on standby. Plywood covers the windows of the State Capitol. Tall metal barricades surround Capitol Square, with police vehicles idling on pathways just inside locked pedestrian gates. Downtown streets will be closed; signs warning against carrying guns have gone up around the city.xe2x80x9cThe violent, lawless insurrection and assault on democracy and its institutions that unfolded last week in Washington, D.C., will not be tolerated in the city of Richmond,xe2x80x9d Mayor Levar Stoney warned on Thursday.The threats may have been credible, but when Farina began live-streaming to an audience of 6,000, the event turned out to be peaceful and unremarkable, though not without interest from a news perspective. xe2x80x9cFrankly, there might have been more press than protesters,xe2x80x9d Status Coupxe2x80x99s Chariton said later. xe2x80x9cAnd while it was live, it was pretty informative. Jon talked to 4-5 people, and they pretty much all made it clear that they werenxe2x80x99t Trump supporters, that they didnxe2x80x99t support what happened in the Capitol. They were pretty relaxed compared to the propaganda ahead of time.xe2x80x9dDespite the seeming unremarkableness of the event, it shut down abruptly mid-feed. Chariton assumed something happened on Farinaxe2x80x99s end. xe2x80x9cThen I got an email from YouTube, telling me wexe2x80x99d violated their xe2x80x98Firearms Policy.xe2x80x99 I wasnxe2x80x99t aware they had a firearms policy.xe2x80x9d January 18th 2021Chariton went onto Twitter to announce what happened, and after a few well-known media figures like Krystal Ball and Ryan Grim complained, YouTube restored the content. Other independents covering the rally, however, like Andrew Kimmel, never had their content restored. The serious consequence of the Virginia episode was not so much the lost coverage of the rally, but what Chariton had to tell Farina after the event. Well-known for covering labor issues, homelessness, and especially the Flint water crisis, Status Coup had been growing, in large part because of live stream content. Now, however, the possibility that YouTube might issue a strike against his channel, or take it down altogether, forced him into a difficult decision. xe2x80x9cI had to tell [Farina] not to go live anymore,xe2x80x9d he says. One person at the same rally wasnxe2x80x99t surprised by what happened. Videographer and well-known protest shooter Ford Fischer of News2Share, the first profile subject of xe2x80x9cMeet the Censored,xe2x80x9d was also in Richmond to shoot the event. He didnxe2x80x99t get taken down by YouTube, but only because he didnxe2x80x99t bother trying to go live. xe2x80x9cI was there on January 18th and didnxe2x80x99t stream it, because I knew itxe2x80x99d get banned,xe2x80x9d Fischer says. xe2x80x9cI filmed basically the same rally on January 17th and it did get banned.xe2x80x9dThe January 17th rally Fischer referenced was a pro-gun rally in Columbus, Ohio, that in the wake of the Capitol riot garnered significant advance media coverage. Once again, headlines like xe2x80x9cFBI warns of Potential Boogaloo Violence During January 17th Ralliesxe2x80x9d primed audiences to expect the worst, and also to make a direct connection with the January 6th events. In fact, Twitter cited the coming Ohio rally in its post announcing the closure of Donald Trumpxe2x80x99s account, describing the Ohio event as a possible xe2x80x9csecondary attackxe2x80x9d:Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. According to Fischer, the Twitter announcement didnxe2x80x99t exactly make sense, because the protesters in Ohio were more of a libertarian ilk, and, as Farina and Chariton discovered in the Virginia crowd, not so clearly aligned with Trump as Twitter and other media outlets may have imagined. Fischer has frequently covered events involving the gun-toting Boogaloos, whom he describes as anti-authoritarian and less likely to be Trumpists than to profess a pox-on-both-houses attitude to Trump and Joe Biden both (xe2x80x9cYou might hear something like, xe2x80x98Unless you put Ron Paul on the ballot, Ixe2x80x99m not voting,xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d he says).Although therexe2x80x99s significant national interest in the group, both among supporters and detractors, Fischer says xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99ve basically stopped trying to live stream rallies involving Boogaloos.xe2x80x9d Back on July 4th, 2020, he shot a live stream of a joint armed rally of Boogaloos and Black Lives Matter, protesting together against police violence xe2x80x94 here again, we see the significant political differences between Trump supporters and some of these pro-gun groups xe2x80x94 only to have the live stream interrupted, on the same grounds that it violated Googlexe2x80x99s firearms policy. Nonetheless, Fischer attempted to shoot the January 17th rally, among other things because of the obvious public interest in the event, which was heavily covered by the mainstream press. Local TV affiliates associated with networks like ABC and CNN covered the January 17th rallies in Columbus and in other locations, even broadcasting live. However, when Fischer tried to live stream, he was cut off in short order by a notice identical to the one received by Chariton. He was reminded that YouTube xe2x80x9cdoes not allow live streams showing someone holding, handling, or transporting a firearm.xe2x80x9dThe policy presents obvious head-scratching issues. For one, as Fischer points out, virtually all police carry a firearm, so xe2x80x9ctherexe2x80x99s obviously some subjectivity in whatxe2x80x99s being enforced.xe2x80x9d Furthermore, the rule doesnxe2x80x99t seem to apply to major corporate outlets, a double-standard problem thatxe2x80x99s a constant in this universe.In an even more bizarre recent incident, YouTube this past weekend removed video Fischer shot on January 6th xe2x80x94 not live footage, but still xe2x80x94 of the crowd listening to Donald Trump before the Capitol riot. This time, the grounds were that the content advanced xe2x80x9cfalse claims that widespread fraud errors or glitches affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.xe2x80x9dFischer supposes the issue has to do with the fact that the unedited, single-shot video xe2x80x94 which is focused mainly on the crowd reaction xe2x80x94 caught Trumpxe2x80x99s own words. This might make sense, except that Trumpxe2x80x99s speech that day is still on YouTube, as broadcast by several CBS affiliates, among others. As with Farina, Fischerxe2x80x99s Capitol protest footage was picked up by numerous major outlets, including CNN, NBC, CBS, BBC, and others, but the system seems to incentivize independent shooters to distribute footage through corporate outlets only, rather than conveying directly to their own audiences.  xe2x80x9cI absolutely think therexe2x80x99s a campaign against independent content creators, especially live,xe2x80x9d Fischer says. xe2x80x9cMajor outlets face no such technical issues.xe2x80x9dThis makes any attempt to build an alternative news outlet a steep uphill climb, even when therexe2x80x99s a positive audience response, as Chariton has found out.

Very rich dumbasses, but still dumbasses. They are incapable of thinking through possible scenarios in which it might be legitimate to display weapons, violence, or bigotry in a video, or at least, they prefer not to think about such things because there are no algorithms that can handle nuances like that. Algorithms cannot tell the difference between a gun in a video promoting violence, a gun in a video discussing violence, and a gun in documentary footage. Since the technology doesn't allow them to algorithmically moderate content in a sensible, responsible, intelligent way, they prefer to moderate content in a simplistic, socially irresponsible, idiotic way.To anyone with half a brain, a video containing part of a racist rant by a Nazi waving a gun is only a good or bad depending on context. Is the video promoting this guy, or is it letting him hang himself with his own words? Or is it just saying, \"This is what happened in this place, at this time\"? These distinctions matter!America is moving in the direction of a police state and it only works because big tech is in bed with the DemocratIc party and the establishment wing of the Republican party.  Is this really about the 2nd amendment?  Not even close - gun ownership is a right.  Is it about Trump's speech or the pro-gun protests which a 5th grader can tell you did not incite violence?   Nope.  Big tech's censorship and control is simply about shutting down half of the country's free speech and opinions to strengthen and expand the liberal belief that people with values and ideology that are different from theirs do not deserve to be heard.  They will continue to play this hand until someone steps up  and fights back.  Whether you liked Trump or hated Trump, he wasn't afraid to stand up to this nonsense.No posts","title":"Meet the Censored: Status Coup - TK News by Matt Taibbi","url":"https://taibbi.substack.com/p/meet-the-censored-status-coup"}

We have a special one for you today. Back in January, I wrote a piece about Alibaba. Lillian Li, whose writing on Chinese tech Ixe2x80x99d read and respected, but who Ixe2x80x99d never met, DUNKED on it on Twitter. January 12th 2021She said that xe2x80x9cthe piece missed local context.xe2x80x9d Which, fair. She also wrote a more complete response on her Substack, Alibaba: from growth to value.I loved getting Lillianxe2x80x99s perspective -- one of the reasons I write is so people who are smarter on a particular topic share their knowledge. And when it comes to China tech, Lillian, who worked as a VC in Europe but is now based in China, is as smart as it gets. She writes a great newsletter called Chinese Characteristics. You should subscribe if youxe2x80x99re interested in China tech, and you should be interested in China tech: Subscribe to Chinese CharacteristicsLillian and I got to know each other after that exchange. We decided to team up. Reprise the olxe2x80x99 bull and bear schtick, but together this time. In other words, we shifted our debate method to Real-Time Engagement (I promise, this will make sense /maybe be funny in a minute).Letxe2x80x99s get to it. Today's Not Boring is brought to you by PublicAs you read above, the fastest way to get smarter about investing is to put your ideas out there and get dunked on by xe2x80xa6 errr... have a conversation with other smart investors.

A decade and a half later, each started his own company.One, Eric Yuan, founded a company youxe2x80x99re all too familiar with: Zoom. The other, Bin xe2x80x9cTonyxe2x80x9d Zhao, founded Agora. If youxe2x80x99ve joined a conversation on Clubhouse , attended a virtual event on RunTheWorld, or binged livestreams on Bilibili youxe2x80x99ve experienced Agora. Itxe2x80x99s been sitting there, in the background, making sure the audio and video come through clearly. Agora builds real-time audio and video capabilities and delivers them as a Software Development Kit (SDK) and Application Programming Interface (API) for app developers. Itxe2x80x99s an API-first company that makes it easy for developers to add real-time video and audio into their product. Stripe for Real-Time Voice and Video Engagement, if you will. The company is so API that its ticker is API. Agora is also a great excuse to cover a few different relevant topics:API-first businesses and business modelsLive video streaming and all of its use cases, like telemedicine and education The audio chat warsBecause Agora sits in the background -- itxe2x80x99s a xe2x80x9cpicks and shovelsxe2x80x9d company -- it doesnxe2x80x99t care who wins as long as more people communicate, learn, heal, play, and xe2x80x9clive real life online,xe2x80x9d in real time. Agora, dual-headquartered out of Shanghai and Santa Clara, went public in June last year. It was relatively quiet for its first six months as a public company, bouncing around the $3-6 billion market cap range, until investors picked up on the Clubhouse connection in January and sent shares soaring. In February, the company topped out over $12 billion before crashing after providing conservative 2021 guidance on its last earnings call. Source: Atom FinanceToday, the company is trading at a $6.5 billion valuation on projected 2021 revenue of $182 million. Itxe2x80x99s cheaper, but itxe2x80x99s not cheap. As Packy was browsing atom for its numbers, he was confused when he saw that FY21 consensus Enterprise Value (EV) / EBITDA was 4.06x. Seemed like a steal. Then he looked more closely: thatxe2x80x99s 4.06 thousand times EBITDA. Itxe2x80x99s less than eight years old and still growing quickly (74% YoY revenue growth) and most of its revenue still comes from China (~80%). Itxe2x80x99s young and fast-growing enough that whether youxe2x80x99re bullish or bearish on the company depends less on todayxe2x80x99s metrics, and more on how you think about its growth potential and defensibility going forward. Therexe2x80x99s a good case to be made on both sides, and wexe2x80x99re going to do just that. Packyxe2x80x99s going to take the bull case, and Lillianxe2x80x99s going to take the bear case. Then wexe2x80x99ll fight it out and let you know where we end up. To get there, wexe2x80x99ll cover: Agoraxe2x80x99s History$APIxe2x80x99s APIChinaxe2x80x99s Livestreaming BoomWhat Agora Looks Like TodayThe Bull Case for AgoraThe Bear Case Against AgoraBull or Bear? To kick it off, letxe2x80x99s go back to the granddaddy of online video communication: WebEx. Who knows what video communication on the internet would look like today if WebEx just embarrassed its employees a little less. Eric Yuan explained to Bessemer partner Byron Deeter, xe2x80x9cEvery time I talked to a WebEx customer, I felt very embarrassed, because I did not speak with a single happy WebEx customer.xe2x80x9dAfter fourteen years at WebEx, the last four under Cisco, which acquired WebEx in 2007, Yuan left to found Zoom in 2011. He set out to build what he couldnxe2x80x99t convince Cisco execs to let him build at WebEx, a new version of the product rebuilt from the ground up with customer happiness in mind. Bin xe2x80x9cTonyxe2x80x9d Zhao, another WebEx founding engineer had similar feelings. After building and releasing real-time audio sessions, he said on GGV Capitalxe2x80x99s Next Billion Podcast, xe2x80x9cI started to regret taking that job, because I got a lot of complaints after the first release, and I realized there are some complaints that I believe I cannot solve at that time.xe2x80x9dZhao didnxe2x80x99t have Yuanxe2x80x99s patience. He left in 2004 to start NeoTasks, which he describes on his LinkedIn page as: xe2x80x9cP2p streaming technology and service provider for various companies in media, advertising, video sharing industries.xe2x80x9dIn 2008, Zhao sold NeoTasks to Chinese streaming site YY.com and joined the company as CTO. That experience shaped what he would build at Agora. YY during the early 2010s was Chinaxe2x80x99s Second Life. The documentary called Peoplexe2x80x99s Republic of Desires gives a glimpse into this brave new world where fortunes were made and lost overnight. According to Interconnectedxe2x80x99s Kevin Xu, xe2x80x9cIs one of the first livestreaming platforms to reach scale in China, if not the world. It is arguably one of the first instances where people were xe2x80x98living real life online.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d Like Tencentxe2x80x99s QQ, which was early to new forms of online monetization like avatars and digital gifting, YY was early to gifting and tipping with virtual goods and real money, a behavior thatxe2x80x99s now common online. The company also pushed the boundaries on real-time engagement. Xu told TechBuzz Chinaxe2x80x99s Rui Ma that under Zhao, YY could handle 8 million concurrent users, and up to 100k in the same room, back in 2011. That year, it handled 421 billion voice minutes, more than Skype. After working in B2B at WebEx, YY opened Zhaoxe2x80x99s eyes to the potential of the consumer internet. He told GGVxe2x80x99s Next Billion Podcast: I start to realize this technology is not going to be only sitting in the conference room, not only serve the purpose for people to negotiate or discuss certain business topics, it actually helped people to live online. Like they can play, they can have a party, they can sing karaoke, they can actually make friends online through video chat, audio chat. I can envision from there, people can actually live online and thatxe2x80x99s part of the inspiration that led to Agora as well.In 2013, realizing the opportunity to accelerate the transition to rich online experiences through real-time audio and video, Zhao left YY to start Agora. Unlike Yuan, who wanted to build a better version of the user-facing product the two built at WebEx, Zhao wanted to build products that helped developers build new user-facing products like WebEx and YY. He wanted to build APIs.Like Yuan, Zhaoxe2x80x99s track record made fundraising easy. He raised $6 million a couple of months after forming the company, and went on to raise $126 million from top investors including SIG, GGV, and Coatue.Zoom was praised for raising so little -- $146 million -- before going public. Agora raised even less. Zoom took eight years to go public, Agora took less than seven. But while Zoom is a household name, chances are you havenxe2x80x99t heard much about Agora. Thatxe2x80x99s because of what it builds, and who it builds for. Agora builds APIs and SDKs for real-time voice and video communication. Itxe2x80x99s one of a growing number of Communications Platforms as a Service (CPaaS) companies, along with Twilio and Vonage, and more specifically bills itself as a Real-Time Engagement Platform as a Service (RTE-PaaS). (This is getting out of hand). It provides a Software-Defined Real-Time Network (SD-RTN) solution to deliver high-quality video and audio across a wide range of devices and environments. (OK, Ixe2x80x99ll stop.)With the acronyms out of the way, what does Agora actually do? Like any good API-first company, Agora lets developers build some superpower into their products with a few lines of code. Stripe lets companies accept payments. Stytch lets them onboard and authenticates users. Agora lets them embed high-quality real-time audio and video. Agora is not for static video or audio. The next YouTube, Netflix, or Spotify wonxe2x80x99t be built on Agora. Itxe2x80x99s for interactive, real-time video and audio, like one-to-many livestreams, audio chat rooms, or one-on-one use cases like telemedicine or tutoring. Before Agora, and even occasionally today, companies spun up their own products by building on top of the open source WebRTC standard. WebRTC is built on the public internet, which is a xe2x80x9cbest-effort networkxe2x80x9d - it will make the best effort to deliver your data. In many cases, that best effort is not good enough, leading to laggy or glitchy video and audio. If your business relies on video and audio, you need a better solution. Thatxe2x80x99s what Agora built. According to analyst Richard Chu: Agora builds on this (WebRTC) with over 200 co-located data centers globally, dedicated to processing real-time audio and video data. To further improve performance, Agora uses intelligent algorithms to monitor requests and optimize data transmission paths to ensure low latency (~300ms) and resilience to packet loss (up to 70%) which ultimately translates into a superior end-user experience. This virtual overlay network is called the SD-RTN.Agora does a ton of engineering work and spends a ton of money on co-located data centers behind the scenes to make real-time audio and video just work. The result is that someone on WiFi in Ghana and another person on 4G LTE with spotty signal in Florida can sit in the same Clubhouse room with thousands of other people and hear the conversation crystal clear. In fact, Clubhouse was apparently built in a week on top of Agoraxe2x80x99s voice APIs. Because Agoraxe2x80x99s product is an SDK and over 200 specific APIs, all of which work seamlessly with a wide range of programming languages and devices, it makes something previously expensive, slow, and complicated, cheap, fast, and easy. In fact, one Agora customer interviewed on a Tegus expert call said that his company tried to spin up its own product using WebRTC, but shifted course when they achieved only 80% reliability internationally. After building on Agora, he said that going back to WebRTC to save money is xe2x80x9cprobably not a feasible option in a way that we want to focus on what we're good at as a company.xe2x80x9dThatxe2x80x99s the power of API-first businesses. As Packy wrote in APIs All the Way Down: This is the beauty of API-first companies. They allow customers to focus on the one or two things that differentiate their businesses, while plugging in best-in-class solutions everywhere else.Instead of wasting time trying to re-solve all of the hard technical problems, not to mention setting up 200 co-located data centers around the globe to ensure global reliability, Agoraxe2x80x99s customers just write a few lines of code to plug in the best technology on the market, which constantly improves as Agoraxe2x80x99s team ships updates. Plus, Agoraxe2x80x99s customers pay as they go, making it easy to get started. Agora is free for the first 10,000 minutes each month, and afterwards, it charges per 1,000 minutes, with different rates for different products and quality levels. It applies automatic volume-based discounts: free up to 10k minutes, 5% off from 100k-500k, 7% off from 500k-1mm, and 10% off from 1mm-3mm. Putting that in perspective, assuming that Clubhouse gets the 10% discount and nothing special on top, each hour-long Clubhouse room with the max of 8,000 people in it costs $427.68. The same room in standard video would cost $1,723 per hour, for standard quality. Premium would run you $3,883 per hour. Itxe2x80x99s no wonder Clubhousexe2x80x99s founders have said they want to keep the product-audio-only. Video is expensive! While Agora can serve all sorts of use cases -- one-on-one telemedicine consultations, audio rooms, in-video-game chats, and more -- its bread and butter, and where it makes the most money, is on one-to-many video livestreams.Itxe2x80x99s hard for westerners to appreciate the magnitude of the livestreaming opportunity without experiencing it firsthand, but itxe2x80x99s central to the Agora thesis. Luckily, Lillian can give the local perspective. Saying livestreaming is big in China is akin to calling your phone a smartphone. Technically correct but so obvious itxe2x80x99s redundant. Since the advent of 4G and the roll-out of 5G, livestreaming and short videos are the two new mediums of the Chinese internet.As a delivery mechanism, since 2015, livestreaming has come to encompass entertainment, education, socialisation, and, bolstered by COVID-19, commerce. In 2020, 560m people in China watched livestreams -- roughly 39% of Chinaxe2x80x99s population -- and the Chinese market livestreaming e-commerce is estimated to be worth RMB 1.05 trillion ($165bn USD). In China, livestreaming is the metaversexe2x80x99s manifestation thatxe2x80x99s eating the world. A leisurely stroll down the streets of Shanghai shows the donut light of livestreaming as a familiar fixture in boutiques. Occasionally, in particularly touristy or scenic spots, youxe2x80x99ll see livestreamers in the wild, talking to their fans who are flooding them with messages and gifts. In quieter cafes, students stream tutoring courses from superstar teachers. Every other night, Lillianxe2x80x99s mother tunes into her Chinese stock course with her favourite Key Opinion Leader (KOL) along with thousands of others on a WeChat mini-app. Whatever Chinese consumer app Lillian opens these days, be it Taobao or Pinduoduo or JD or Xiaohongshu (Chinaxe2x80x99s closest equivalent to Instagram), the first prompt is to view the current livestreams for different products.In Livestreaming monetisation models, Lillian wrote: Livestreaming as a medium is a conflation of a product as well as as a distribution channel. It exists on a spectrum of being pure entertainment on one-side and a new go-to-market strategy on the other, with different kinds of monetisation models for each side. While western startups have centred around the 'livestreaming as product' theme, China, with its enabling infrastructure in payment and fulfilment, have been quick to adopt livestreaming as a new distribution channel. This June's 618 Shopping Festival, saw Alibaba and JD.com report a combined total of $136.5 billion of livestreaming sales. Kuaishou surpassed 170 million daily active livestreaming shoppers in June and Pinduoduo also wants its ~500m users to start streaming as well. No longer just for small ticket items -- houses, cars, phones have all been sold during the lockdown -- livestreaming is climbing up the value chain.Livestreamingxe2x80x99s journey looks a lot like our familiar Gartner Hype Cycle: The great un-lock for Chinaxe2x80x99s livestreaming industry was monetisation, but since then, it has entered the culture. It has created an entire ecosystem of new livestreamers and the talent agencies (called Multi-Channel Networks) that spot talent and nurture them (or lure unsuspecting folks in to fleece them. New industries are grey areas). Remember this video? November 30th 2020Thatxe2x80x99s a training camp for livestreamers. Everyone is training to be the next Viya - who is essentially Oprah incarnated as a livestreamer. She can command 37m viewers (bigger than the audience for the Oscars or Game of Thrones finale) during a stream. Even Kim Kardashian had to pay a pilgrimage to the Don when she came on to Tmall to sell her KKW branded perfume. With Viyaxe2x80x99s support, she sold out all 150,000 bottles in 1 minute. Was this a representation of one of social mediaxe2x80x99s biggest stars  acknowledging her successor in the dawn of a new medium? At this point, hopefully wexe2x80x99ve convinced you that livestreaming in China is big, and that livestreaming e-commerce is an established distribution channel. We should also highlight that it is also enabled by local factors in China including embedded digital payment system, robust logistics chain for next day delivery and returns, an ecosystem of Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs) cultivating talent, fandom culture which allows for a frictionless checkout and buying experience. A lot of foundational pieces need to fall into place before the flywheel can really take-off for livestreaming e-commerce (which is a very specific form of livestreaming). This means, Chinaxe2x80x99s livestreaming is not so much the future as much as a potential future for the world.Livestreaming, and particularly livestreaming in China, has been Agoraxe2x80x99s core focus. Itxe2x80x99s the hardest to get right, and no one does it better than Agora for the price. But itxe2x80x99s beginning to diversify. Today, Agora offers the following product lines, all supported by its Real-Time Engagement platform:As more competitors enter the space, wexe2x80x99re seeing an increasing verticalization and internationalisation of their product range. One focus area is education. As education moves online, and superstar teachers livestream to much larger classes than was possible physically, Agora is flexing its muscles to accommodate new needs. At the beginning of the pandemic, the company worked with New Oriental Education, a publicly traded private education company, to bring the school online in a week, supporting classes as large as 20,000 concurrent students. Itxe2x80x99s leaned into education heavily since. Later last year, Agora announced the release of flexible classroom, a low-code application targeting education providers. Theyxe2x80x99re augmenting the education product suite with acquisitions, including Easemob (an instant messaging API provider) and an interactive whiteboard API provider. The company has also been on a roll in obtaining a slew of security clearances such as HIPAA, which allows them to serve the booming telemedicine market, and GDPR, which should give western companies more comfort embedding Chinese tech. The future of product for Agora will be moving towards greater localisation as it tailors their offerings to the requirements of regions outside of China. CustomersIn China, Agora focuses on education, entertainment, gaming, healthcare with emerging categories for finance, IoT, and e-commerce. As it makes an international push, itxe2x80x99s seeing success with customers who share those use cases, including Hallo in education, Clubhouse in entertainment, Unity in Gaming, and talkspace in telehealth. Over the past couple of quarters, non-China revenue has grown from 20% to nearly 30%. Its Nasdaq listing and Clubhousexe2x80x99s meteoric rise have no doubt helped give western customers more confidence. Together, Agoraxe2x80x99s customers now consume 40 billion minutes per month, or nearly half a trillion minutes annually. Those minutes translate directly into top line growth. FinancialsAs its customers consume more minutes, Agora is growing tremendously quickly. Growth naturally slowed from a COVID-charged 166% in Q1 2020, but it still grew 74% YoY last quarter.The company has solid gross margins of 60%, but theyxe2x80x99re on a slight downtrend. As gross margins compress and SG&A and R&D expenses increase, Agora dipped back into the red for the past two quarters after being profitable in Q1 and Q2 of 2020. Those two quarters of profitability are a good sign that as top line grows, Agora can generate profits, but it has ramped up spend in R&D to continue to build its lead on the technical side and improve localisation, and SG&A to acquire more international customers. Agora is an API-first business, which means it grows in two ways: Acquires new customersExisting customersxe2x80x99 usage expandsIt tries to get into companies early and grow with them as they grow, and itxe2x80x99s working. Agora reported comically high 179% dollar-based net revenue expansion in 2020, meaning that the same customers spent 79% more last year than the year before on average, even accounting for any customers that churned. Thatxe2x80x99s top percentile stuff, and a testament to Agoraxe2x80x99s stickiness.That kind of growth and retention doesnxe2x80x99t come cheap. Based on Public Compsxe2x80x99 data, itxe2x80x99s the sixth most expensive company in the BVP Cloud Index at a 29.5x EV/2021 Revenue multiple. But itxe2x80x99s also the fourth best based on the Rule of 40, a SaaS heuristic that says that companies are strong when their YoY revenue growth plus free cash flow (FCF) adds up to more than 40%. Agora is at 77%, behind only Zoom, Square, and Shopify among BVP Cloud companies, and right ahead of Twilio. Agora is young, expensive, and fast-growing. Itxe2x80x99s the only company in the BVP Rule of 40 Top 5 with a market cap under $10 billion. The next closest, Twilio, is 10x more valuable at $65 billion. Each of those companies exist in categories -- video conferencing, ecommerce, and messaging -- that are more mature than livestreaming. Can livestreaming catch up? Ixe2x80x99m making my bull case on growth, not price. Agora is certainly expensive today. To be an Agora bull, you need to believe three things: Livestreaming will continue to growAgora has the best product in the market Itxe2x80x99s defensible against bigger incumbents and startups alike. Thatxe2x80x99s it. Letxe2x80x99s take a look at each. 1. Livestreaming will continue to grow.As Lillian highlighted, livestreaming is massive in China. Livestreaming ecommerce in China alone is a $165 billion market. Thatxe2x80x99s e-commerce sales via livestreaming. Market Research Future expects the livestreaming market more broadly to reach $247 billion globally by 2027, growing at a 28.1% CAGR between now and then. There are some major catalysts: 5G: As 5G rolls out, it will be cheaper, faster, and easier to create and consume livestreaming content from anywhere. Audio Chat: Clubhouse just announced a Series C valuing the company at $4 billion, on the heels of a January Series B at $1 billion. Whether you think thatxe2x80x99s ridiculously overvalued or not (I do for the record), itxe2x80x99s a good sign for Agoraxe2x80x99s most prominent western customer, and itxe2x80x99s accelerating the adoption of audio chat as a feature. Twitter rolled out Spaces, Spotify acquired Locker Room to build its own Clubhouse competitor, Facebook is of course jumping in, Slack announced its own Clubhouse competitor on Clubhouse, and even fucking LinkedIn is building Clubhouse-like functionality. While these platforms are big enough to roll their own tech, even if they donxe2x80x99t go with Agora, theyxe2x80x99re signaling to new companies in Agoraxe2x80x99s target market that they, too, should be adding audio chat into their products. If audio chat is a commoditized feature, thatxe2x80x99s a good thing for the companies that sell audio chat picks and shovels. The Verticalization of Zoom. Zoomxe2x80x99s rapid COVID ascent attracted countless startups building products that take live-streaming video for granted, and embed it to create tailored experiences that solve particular user needs. JJ Oslund wrote about this trend in The Verticalization of Zoom.  All of these new video-based products fighting it out for customers is a great thing for Agora and other video APIs. We havenxe2x80x99t even talked about VR, AR, and the Metaverse, but at this point, you know Ixe2x80x99m bullish. Zhao has hinted on his ambitions in VR in particular, and Agora is already integrated in some VR education products. There will be no shortage of demand for products that make it easy to embed real-time voice and video into products as the world continues to move online. The question is, will Agora capture that opportunity? 2. Agora has the best product in the marketWexe2x80x99re going to assume that most of the large players like Facebook and Twitter will build (or acquire) their own video and audio products, but that startups are not going to build for themselves. Itxe2x80x99s too costly and time-consuming, and theyxe2x80x99re not going to be able to match Agora.  So which product will they use? Agora has become a go-to piece of the tech stack for companies building video streaming products. In Zoomxe2x80x99s Blank Check, Packy wrote: Akarsh Sanghi, who recently launched a video streaming platform for lifestyle creators called Reach.Live out of YC, told me that all the new YC companies are building on the same stack: xe2x80x9cReact application on the client side, typescript, hasura, Postgres, WebRTC and Agora APIs for the video player.xe2x80x9dAgora targets companies with scale ambitions. Itxe2x80x99s built for developers and pursues a bottoms-up go-to-market strategy. It gives away 10,000 minutes per month so that builders can try the product, and then retains them with affordable pricing and a quality experience. According to the company itself, its advantages come from the SD-RTN and 200+ global data centers, which minimize latency, its flexibility via a suite of customizable APIs, its ability to scale to millions of users, and compatibility with a multitude of development platforms and devices. Agora is so confident in its product that itxe2x80x99s piloting the XLA (Experience Level Agreement), a play on an SLA thatxe2x80x99s based on experience instead of just uptime. Customers shouldnxe2x80x99t have to pay for laggy video or audio just because it technically gets through. Thatxe2x80x99s a move you make if you believe you have the best experience and want to force competitors to play by your terms.According to multiple customers interviewed on Tegus, all of whom evaluated multiple competitors for their products and whose uses range from video-game audio chat to one-to-many online video education, Agoraxe2x80x99s advantage comes down to a combination of price, ease, scalability, and quality. Some competitors do certain things better than Agora -- Dolby.io has more top-end audio functionality, for example -- but the sentiment is that no product works as well across video and audio, for close to the price, as Agora does.  Agora is currently used by some of the biggest livestreaming platforms in China -- YY, Momo, Bilibili, New Oriental Education, and Huya -- and as livestreaming takes off in the west, itxe2x80x99s well-positioned as the safe, scalable, affordable choice. xe2x80x9cNobody ever got fired for buying Agora.xe2x80x9d3. Itxe2x80x99s defensible against bigger incumbents and startups alike. Agora is not alone. In Unbundling Zoom, Oslund expanded on that trend, highlighting the many players in the xe2x80x9cVideo API Wars.xe2x80x9d First, there is a wave of startups building video APIs. Hopin, one of the fastest-growing startups in history, is built on Mux, as are SoulCycle and Equinoxxe2x80x99s streaming and on-demand classes. Not Boring portfolio company Teamflow is built on Daily, and CEO Flo Crivello told me they love it. Daily counts Y Combinator, Icebreaker, and Tandem among its clients, too. Twilio offers solutions more geared towards less price-sensitive enterprise clients who may already use Twilioxe2x80x99s original messaging products. There are more, as seen in the chart above, and more even beyond that. Meanwhile, incumbents and large cloud players like AWS and Tencent Cloud have ambitions to enter the real-time engagement space. But Agora has moats against both, starting with scale economies. Scale economies against startups make sense, and are similar to those enjoyed by any API-first first-mover: Agoraxe2x80x99s 200+ data centers are a hard-to-replicate advantage, and itxe2x80x99s able to spread the costs of developing better solutions to edge cases across more customers. When the difference between excellent and terrible performance is measured in milliseconds, the little things matter. Startup competitors will steal particular use cases like 1-1 chat or high-end audio from Agora, but I donxe2x80x99t think theyxe2x80x99ll be able to catch Agoraxe2x80x99s quality and scalability across the full suite of real-time engagement products. Interestingly, that scale advantage extends to its battle against larger, better-funded cloud giants. One expert, an exec at a competitor, told Tegus that Tencent Cloud and AWS are limited by where their own data centers are because theyxe2x80x99re not willing to rent from cloud competitors. Tencent will struggle to compete for customers with global audiences, for example, because itxe2x80x99s not willing to partner with AWS. Agora can rent from anyone, which gives it better global coverage, which gives it lower latency on calls with global participants. Another advantage is switching costs. One customer interviewed on Tegus summed it up: One thing I can tell you is that when it comes to price, if a company is not able to provide a model that is literally twice cheaper than Agora, it would be really hard for me to switch. Like if one of the Chinese companies says, \"Hey, I can give you 100% discount from Agora's pricing,\" like I might consider, but if it's like 50%, like 40%, 30%, even like 20%, like the cost of switching is so high.Finally, therexe2x80x99s Agoraxe2x80x99s head-start combined with its focus. While this isnxe2x80x99t a traditional moat, it is an advantage. The competitor exec on Tegus said that even if the cloud giants poured a ton of resources into catching up to Agora, it would take them a year just to get to where Agora is today, by which point Agora would be another year ahead. Outside of Amazon with AWS, where they really created the market, there are no good examples of companies shifting from a customer-facing product to a developer-focused API product and winning. I have doubts that Zoom, which is making a big push on its own APIs, will be able to effectively compete with Agora, either. In fact, I think Zoom should just buy Agora.Ixe2x80x99m bullish on Agora. Real-time engagement is exploding, and will become table-stakes in many products. Standalone livestreaming will continue to boom in China, and itxe2x80x99s already beginning to spread to the rest of the world. Agora is best-positioned to capture the opportunity, and it has moats to protect its profits as competitors enter the space. All that, and itxe2x80x99s only worth $6.6 billion.Over to you, Lillian. What am I missing? So letxe2x80x99s go through each of Packyxe2x80x99s assumptions and unpack-y them. Livestreamingxe2x80x99s revolution will not be global The thrust of the bull case for Agora is that livestreaming will become as ubiquitous in the rest of the world as it has been in China. This glorious future where every dear reader will be half in the metaverse and half out. But what if this livestreaming phenomenon doesnxe2x80x99t become a successful Chinese export like the 2019 scooters and bike co-shares waves, but rather like that of mobile payments? The enablers for livestreaming in China was not just the roll-out of 4G and 5G; but also effective monetisation models and payment infrastructure that made it lucrative for livestreamers, companies and platforms to focus on livestreaming. Chinaxe2x80x99s payment rails and systems have not just leapfrogged their western counterparts, they are built by the tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent themselves. As such they are tech-led rather than finance-led. Will embedding frictionless payment systems within livestreams for the world be as easy as spinning up an instance of Agora? Without a credible monetization model, livestreamers wouldnxe2x80x99t be incentivised to consistently livestream, and platforms wouldnxe2x80x99t achieve content marketplace liquidity. Wexe2x80x99ve seen the downfall of Meerkat, Periscope and Facebook Live; why is this time going to be different? Those didnxe2x80x99t fail because the technology wasnxe2x80x99t there, but because other enabling factors were not. But letxe2x80x99s assume, wexe2x80x99ve got 5G, wexe2x80x99ve cracked payment, what else? Sounds strange but the world needs to know to make livestreaming fun. I recently tuned in to Amazon Live, and promptly shut the window after 2 minutes. It was so bland. The livestreamers didnxe2x80x99t know how to engage with the audience; the audience asked bad questions, there were no stickers or mini-games that made it engaging. It was all functional and no fun, and I was not going to waste my precious procrastination hours on there. Ixe2x80x99ve noticed a similar thing on Clubhouse: peoplexe2x80x99s conversations are meandering and not that engaging. Once the shininess of listening to your favourite tech celebrity wears off, the dopamine hits are far and few in between. All of this is to say, livestreaming the technology is here, but livestreaming as a medium is not. That will take time and deliberate UX decisions to cultivate. If not done correctly and soon, people might lose patience for the technology altogether. After all, every form of entertainment will be competing against Fortnite. Also why entertainment as the default format you ask? Because thatxe2x80x99s the format that makes money for Agora when you are charging by the minute. xe2x80x9cA technology is merely a machine. A medium is the social and intellectual environment a machine createsxe2x80x9d - Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death Ixe2x80x99m reminded of Eugene Weixe2x80x99s seminal Status-as-a-Service blog post. He talked about how dull the early days of Twitter were, with people posting mundane life updates before tighter feedback in the form of status acquisition kicked in. This is where livestreaming is now in the West and itxe2x80x99s got fiercer competition for attention than Twitter had. For China, there were many years of cultural cache and user training built on tipping livestreamers, on livestreamers knowing how to perform for the camera and to engage an audience of thousands. This kind of cultural medium knowledge doesnxe2x80x99t spring up overnight. Fundamentally what Ixe2x80x99m pushing back on is saying that a technology will get adoption because it is big in China, when really we should be asking what made it catch on there in the first place. Agora has the best product for specific use cases in the market and their business model is built around thisAgora was born and bred in a Chinese world of one-to-many livestreaming transmissions. Their killer feature revolves around the fast and steady scaling needs when a streamer turns on their camera and talks to thousands of viewers. Even their pricing is aligned to this model, having frequent 1:1 livestreaming convos might not break the 10,000 free minutes a month mark, but a livestreaming with a few thousands concurrent users gets you there fast. Basically, Agora makes a lot of money when they get used for the use cases for which they were built. Other use cases are doable, but itxe2x80x99s not affecting the bottom line as much.  As Packy said above:Startup competitors will steal particular use cases like 1-1 chat or high-end audio from Agora, but I donxe2x80x99t think theyxe2x80x99ll be able to catch Agoraxe2x80x99s quality and scalability across the full suite of real-time engagement products.But what if wexe2x80x99re in a best-of-breed world for livestreaming and Agoraxe2x80x99s market share gets eaten one by one by startup and enterprise competitors? And what if they are left with use cases and verticals that donxe2x80x99t play to their pricing strengths? I can see a world where the Zoom API takes small-scale internal enterprise conferencing, MUX takes enterprise grade quality video that gets recorded in the US, and big tech such as Twitter and Facebook will use their internal video options which they can also white label to others. In a market where youxe2x80x99re competing against best-of-breed, death will come in the form of a thousand cuts. Can Agora be all things to all people in livestreaming? And if they canxe2x80x99t, are they getting into the verticals that allows them to maximise their revenue?Agoraxe2x80x99s historical strengths have been in social, gaming and education apps. They got into these apps early in China and grew with the company. Their growth, similar to the growth of other API-first companies, has been scaling with emerging companies. Have they arrived at the right time for that in the rest of the world? How many more Clubhouses can there be for Agora? Customers who churn because they want to do it in-houseChinese tech companies are like western tech companies but more so. By which I mean, they tend to do things by extremes. One thing they particularly love is building things in-house. For a core use case such as livestreaming, once it gets big enough, almost every Chinese tech company will have the conversation of whether to bring it house. One comparative advantage Chinese tech firms hold is that labour is cheaper, and theoretically, the thinking goes, that should lower the total cost of ownership. I am skeptical of whether this trend will play out in the long term for Chinese firms or western firms. Twilio went through the same journey that Agora now is, and customers found the costly piece wasnxe2x80x99t the labour but the on-going maintenance. WhatsApp still pays Twilio hundreds of millions of dollars per year. I donxe2x80x99t think that will stop them from trying in the short term. Itxe2x80x99s interesting to note that on the customer page for Agora, heavy hitters such as Bilibili, Meituan, and Huya have disappeared during 2020. While they might come back to Agora in a few years, the churn is still a concern in the short term. The Chinese company spectreThere is a narrative tax on being a Chinese company these days. Ixe2x80x99m commenting on the meta-narratives and the baggage associated with China in all fields, but particularly tech.Itxe2x80x99s debatable whether itxe2x80x99s warranted but itxe2x80x99s definitely present and itxe2x80x99s not pretty. Therexe2x80x99s increasing concerns around being a Chinese affiliated company among your buyers, among your employees and among the population at large. Zoom had to go through it as they exploded during Covid-19. Agora had to go through the publiccommentary cycle as Clubhouse got big. What we also know is that private conversations are happening behind closed doors on precisely the same topics. It affects buyerxe2x80x99s perception and trust outside of anything that Agora does or doesnxe2x80x99t do (even as it has obtained ISO27001, ISO27017, ISO27018, and SOC2 Type1 certifications and passed third-party GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA compliance testing/ auditing). Itxe2x80x99s a shame but also a reflection of our current geo-political climate onto the private economy. How much this will affect Agoraxe2x80x99s actual progress is hard to say, but the ambiguity is what makes it tough.So which is it? Bull or Bear? Agora is in a tricky spot, full of natural tensions: It wants to serve the broadest range of real-time engagement use cases well to appeal to the customers who need everything to just work, but faces competition from more geographically and use-case focused competitors. It wants to expand to the west, but hasnxe2x80x99t made the proactive PR push that Zoom has to appease westerners security concerns.It wants its customers to get very big, but not so big that they build in-house. If Agora keeps growing at industry-leading rates in China while expanding to the west, the one-to-many thousands use case takes off outside of China, and Agoraxe2x80x99s product continues to beat competitors on the combination of price and quality at scale, we might look back on $6 billion as the steal of the century in a few years. Agora is a bet that people will live more of their lives online, and that large scale one-to-many livestreams become more common. The internet rewards the best. Instead of 10 million teachers with ten students each, the hundred best teachers will stream to a million students each. The same dynamic plays out across industries.  If and when that happens, Agora is well-positioned to win. But if competitors out-focus Agora by serving particular use cases better than it can serve those use cases as part of a broader suite, and if Agoraxe2x80x99s not able to shake its xe2x80x9cChinese companyxe2x80x9d label in the West, its growth may be limited and its revenue multiple will be hard to grow into.Ironically, Lillian is actually long $API and Packy doesnxe2x80x99t own any shares.

Todayxe2x80x99s post couldnxe2x80x99t have been timed any better. Ixe2x80x99ve been talking to the BlockFi team for a couple of months, and we picked April 15th about a month ago. We didnxe2x80x99t know that Coinbase would be IPOxe2x80x99ing yesterday, or that Ixe2x80x99d be so deep down the crypto rabbit hole at this point. Itxe2x80x99s fate. This is a Sponsored Deep Dive on a company Ixe2x80x99ve been wanting to dig into for a long time. BlockFi offers up to 8.6% APY on deposits, which is obviously tempting and also confounding. Ixe2x80x99ve had so many text conversations with friends that go something like, xe2x80x9cI want to do this, but it has to be bullshit, right? How does that even work? We need you to do a Not Boring on this.xe2x80x9d  Ixe2x80x99m happy to report that it is not bullshit, and I have the receipts to prove it.Letxe2x80x99s get to it.Coinbase IPOxe2x80x99d yesterday to wild success. After touching $420.69 and going as high as $429.54, it closed at $328.28, up 31% from its reference price of $250. It peaked at a market cap of over $100 billion, and closed at $86 billion. Ixe2x80x99m more excited about BlockFi, though, and not because theyxe2x80x99re sponsoring this post. Itxe2x80x99s a more selfish reason, one that makes the sponsorship money seem like peanuts. See, if BlockFi existed in 2013 instead of Coinbase, I probably wouldnxe2x80x99t even be writing this newsletter. On May 16, 2013, when Coinbase was less than a year old, I set up an account and bought my first bitcoin. I forget why, but I just looked up when Union Square Ventures first invested, and that must have been it: That was good enough for me. I bought 10 BTC on May 16th, another 15 on June 14th, and another 13 on July 12th. That September, after quitting my job in finance, I flew my unemployed ass to Oktoberfest for a fun weekend with a few friends. On September 24th, after ten too many steins, I woke up in my Munich hotel room a little hungover and feeling dumb for spending so much on the trip and the night out... and made the stupidest financial decision of my life. I just sold some of those silly bitcoin Ixe2x80x99d bought, and bingo, free Oktoberfest. It felt like such an obviously responsible thing to do that three days later, I sold ten more, then I sold eight in October, five in November, and the last five in May (for a nice little 4x, I might add!). I sold all 38 bitcoins for a total of $7,232. At current prices, those 38 bitcoins are worth $2,450,050. Gulp. If BlockFi had been around at the time, I could have taken out a USD loan against some of those bitcoin and earned interest on the rest while they sat safely in my account. If BlockFi paid interest on bitcoin that whole time, like they do today, Ixe2x80x99d have more than 40 bitcoin today, or over $2.6 million. Double gulp.  Ixe2x80x99ve told you before that Ixe2x80x99m an idiot, and I wasnxe2x80x99t kidding. But thatxe2x80x99s enough self-chastising for one day. Wexe2x80x99re here to talk about BlockFi.BlockFi, which just announced a $350 million Series D led by Bain Capital Ventures, Pomp Investments, Tiger Global, and partners of DST Global, is building a full-fledged financial institution for crypto investors. BlockFi offers four products to retail investors: BlockFi Interest Account (at rates up to 8.6% APY)Trading AccountsCrypto-Backed LoansCredit CardIt also acts as a prime broker for institutional clients, with custody, financing, execution, and margin. BlockFi is building SoFi plus JP Morganxe2x80x99s prime broker desk, for crypto. Therexe2x80x99s a race going on among everyone in the financial services space -- centralized crypto companies like BlockFi and Coinbase, neobanks like Chime and Monzo, public fintech companies like Square and PayPal/Venmo, and large brokerages and banks -- to become the financial super-app, the place that customers go for loans, credit cards, trading, insurance, cash management, and more. BlockFi has a unique wedge: a growing suite of products that earn clients high interest rates and free crypto.The first question anyone has when they hear about BlockFi is: xe2x80x9cWhatxe2x80x99s the catch? 8.6% APY sounds too good to be true. That canxe2x80x99t be legit.xe2x80x9d I went DEEP to understand how they do it, and itxe2x80x99s legit. Essentially, BlockFi arbitrages the fact that traditional finance and crypto donxe2x80x99t like to deal with each other. To understand how it works, wexe2x80x99re going back down the crypto rabbit hole. Wexe2x80x99ll cover topics like bitcoin, stablecoins, DeFi, and CeFi, and basis trades. Youxe2x80x99ve probably heard the terms, but probably, like me, didnxe2x80x99t fully understand what they mean. Wexe2x80x99ll change that. At the very least, wexe2x80x99ll all sound smarter at our next party.Therexe2x80x99s so much to dig into here that itxe2x80x99s hard to know where to start, but wexe2x80x99re going to try:What Does a Bank Do? What BlockFi DoesStablecoins and 8.6% APYGrayscale Bitcoin TrustThe Race to the Finance Super AppThe OfferAfter doing the research for this piece, I moved some of my money into stablecoins on BlockFi, and transferred all of my (much, much smaller than 2013) bitcoin holdings to BlockFi from Coinbase. Yesterday, I was on a YouTube livestream with Ben Carlson talking about the Coinbase IPO, and unprompted, he said that hexe2x80x99d done the same. If you want to check it out for yourself, sign up with the Not Boring link to get up to $250 in free bitcoin when you fund your account. Try BlockFiIf youxe2x80x99re still wondering what BlockFi is and how it pulls off such high rates, keep reading. Therexe2x80x99s a lot to learn. Letxe2x80x99s start somewhere obviousxe2x80xa6 Banks make money in three main ways: Net Interest Margin. Customers deposit money. Banks lend that money out to other people and businesses at a certain rate, pay depositors a lower rate, and keep the difference.Interchange. When you use a credit or debit card at a store, the store pays your bank and its bank, typically as a percentage of the transaction and a small fixed amount. Fees. Banks charge customers money when they overdraft, take money out of an ATM, and for all sorts of other things. For our purposes, Net Interest Margin is the most important. Itxe2x80x99s the spread between what banks pay on deposits and what they earn on loans. Letxe2x80x99s do the math on a mortgage as an example.Right now, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on a standard Bank of America bank account is 0.01%. Letxe2x80x99s assume they can lend money to a homebuyer on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 3.0%. Bank of Americaxe2x80x99s Net Interest Margin is 3% - 0.01% = 2.99%. Itxe2x80x99s not that banks want to pay next to nothing on deposits. Itxe2x80x99s just that with low rates across the board, banks arenxe2x80x99t able to pay much more and make enough net interest margin to pay for overhead and still generate enough profit to keep shareholders happy. When they could lend money at a higher rate (30-year mortgage rates were 18% in the early xe2x80x9880s), savings accounts paid higher rates too. Banks would love to pay high interest rates on deposits. Banks compete with all of the different things you can do with your money -- buy a house, stocks, or crypto, pay off loans, travel. The higher the interest rate, the more likely you are to keep your money sitting there. More money sitting there means the banks can lend more means higher income for the banks. Given the low rates they earn from borrowers, they just canxe2x80x99t.1BlockFi, however, can. Founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez in 2017, BlockFi is a crypto-native financial institution. But while BlockFi is for crypto investors, itxe2x80x99s not decentralized. It has over 700 employees, a headquarters in Jersey City, and is regulated. On the spectrum between a traditional financial institution (xe2x80x9cTradFixe2x80x9d) and a Decentralized Finance (xe2x80x9cDeFixe2x80x9d) protocol, it falls somewhere in the middle. Like Coinbase, itxe2x80x99s whatxe2x80x99s known as Centralized Finance (xe2x80x9cCeFixe2x80x9d).To a client, BlockFi looks and feels like an online bank. When I set up my account, it felt very much like setting up a regular online bank account. I signed up, verified my identity, and waited a day for everything to get approved. Once I was in, I connected to my bank account via Plaid and deposited money via ACH. The money hit my account instantly and BlockFi converted it to GUSD (a stablecoin). Without me doing anything special or crypto-y, itxe2x80x99s now earning 8.6% APY. With Flex, I chose what currency I get interest paid in. So I deposited in USD, converted automatically to stablecoin, and get 8.6% interest paid out in ETH. Then, I transferred my BTC from Coinbase. It took about two minutes, and now Ixe2x80x99m earning 6% APY on that, in bitcoin. (Rates vary by coin deposited)Within two days of starting the process, I now have a meaningful amount of my net worth in BlockFi. I wouldnxe2x80x99t recommend it if I didnxe2x80x99t trust it for myself. And it was easy. That familiar bank feeling with backend crypto superpowers is by design. Early BlockFi clients were crypto natives (they had to be to use a new crypto-based product during crypto winter), but the company is making a push to attract crypto-curious clients, kind of like us. They want to be the on-ramp for millions of people to get involved with crypto. A couple of interesting things happened in the setup process: It Felt Like a Regular Bank. BlockFixe2x80x99s on-ramp to crypto feels smooth and familiar. Crypto Superpowers. I transferred a good chunk of money from Coinbase to BlockFi in minutes, not the hours or days it would take to send a wire or transfer money between accounts. BlockFi thinks that instant settlement gives it a big advantage over traditional financial institutions. That combination of ease and power is working. In early March, BlockFi announced a $350 million Series D that valued the company at $3 billion. Traditional venture/hedge funds Bain Capital Ventures, Tiger Global, and DST Global joined crypto-focused Pomp Investments as co-leads. At the time of the announcement, the company announced some eye-popping stats:$50 million in monthly revenue, up from $1.5 million a year earlier$15 billion in assets on the platform, up from $1 billion a year earlier0% loss rate across its lending portfolio 50% month-over month growth $50 million per month is an absurd amount of money for a company thatxe2x80x99s less than four years old. It would be a great annual revenue number for a company that age. BlockFi generates revenue in three (soon to be four) ways: BlockFi Interest Account: Earn up to 8.6% APY on stablecoin deposits, 6% on BTC, and 5.25% on ETH.Trading Accounts: No fee trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesCrypto-Backed Loans: Loans on crypto balances as low as 4.5% APRCredit Card: Visa credit card with 1.5% bitcoin back on every purchase (coming soon)These look a lot like the ways that banks make money. Letxe2x80x99s break down each, saving the most complex for last. Trading AccountsBlockFi lets clients buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The product is similar to Coinbase in that itxe2x80x99s a centralized and easy-to-use way to buy crypto, but there are a couple key differences. Coinbase Offers More Currencies. Because Coinbasexe2x80x99s business is all about buying and selling crypto, it offers a lot more assets than BlockFi. You can buy nine assets on BlockFi, and 44 on Coinbase. While BlockFi will add more assets over time, itxe2x80x99s not the focus of the business. Trading on BlockFi is really about giving people a way to build up crypto deposits that BlockFi can lend out, and it only offers trading in coins that it lends. BlockFi Has Lower Fees. Coinbase makes most of its money by charging retail traders fees. Coinbase charges normal accounts 3-4% transaction fees per trade, plus a spread on top. That drops to 0.5% plus a spread for Coinbase Pro accounts. It nets out to a 1.25-1.5% take rate on retail trades. Institutions pay much less, around 0.05%.In Coinbase and the cryptoeconomy, Tanay Jaipuria wrote: Over 95% of the revenue that Coinbase generates comes from transaction revenue, i.e., commissions on trades from retail and institutional clients, so letxe2x80x99s focus on that. Digging one level further, Coinbasexe2x80x99s institutional trading volume makes up about 60% of total volume. However, Coinbase makes 95% of its transaction revenue (and 90% of its total revenue) from retail trading volume.BlockFi does not charge transaction fees, but it does take a spread on trades that averages at around 1%. Itxe2x80x99s cheaper than Coinbase, but more expensive than  exchanges like Binance and FTX that are more powerful but harder to use, particularly for people new to crypto.Importantly, like Coinbase, FTX, Binance, Uniswap, and other exchanges, but unlike non-crypto platforms like Robinhood and PayPal, BlockFi lets you move your coins in and out. At this point, trading is a feature on BlockFi, not a full standalone product. Itxe2x80x99s a way to onboard people to crypto and get them earning yield. Bitcoin Rewards Credit CardBlockFi is launching a credit card, with Visa, that feels like a regular credit card in every way -- you can use it everywhere -- except that it gives you 1.5% back in Bitcoin whenever you use it, and up to $750 or more in bonus bitcoin rewards. This one is straightforward. Credit card providers earn an annual fee and interchange, and itxe2x80x99s up to them to use it in a way that attracts customers and strengthens the business. Traditionally, thatxe2x80x99s meant points, miles, or cash back. In Rampxe2x80x99s Double-Unicorn Rounds, I wrote that instead of points: ...it rewards them with better software. Better software drives more usage, which drives more revenue, which drives better software, and so on. The faster the flywheel turns, the further ahead Ramp pulls. The same principle is at play here. Instead of points or cash back, BlockFi gives people bitcoin. It seems like a minor distinction, but itxe2x80x99s potentially massive, for two reasons. One, theyxe2x80x99re rewards that can increase in value over time. If youxe2x80x99re bullish on bitcoin, then you believe the rewards you earn will be worth more in the future. Youxe2x80x99re getting long bitcoin every time you buy anything. (Of course, they can also go down over time). Two, bitcoin rewards are an on-ramp. There are a lot of people who donxe2x80x99t want to spend their hard-earned cash buying bitcoin, or feel uncomfortable depositing money in an account and trading it for bitcoin. Those same people might be happy to just get free bitcoin for doing something theyxe2x80x99d be doing anyway. Once they do, it kicks off BlockFixe2x80x99s money flywheel: Earn bitcoinBitcoin automatically deposited in BlockFi account, BlockFi lends it outClient earns 6% on bitcoin holdings in bitcoin, building up the stackClient can take USD loans against that bitcoin The bitcoin credit card is an on-ramp, a way to get the next 15 million people to dip their toes in crypto. Itxe2x80x99s an on-ramp to BlockFi, too, and likely a low CAC one - who doesnxe2x80x99t want free bitcoin? Once clients are in the ecosystem, BlockFi can monetize them in all sorts of ways as it builds out more financial institution functionality. Crypto-Backed LoansTherexe2x80x99s this tension in crypto: thousands of people have made millions of dollars by buying and hodling bitcoin, ETH, and other coins. On-chain, theyxe2x80x99re very wealthy. But to actually use that wealth to buy things, they need to sell coins. Thatxe2x80x99s a problem, because selling triggers capital gains taxes in the US, and because most crypto-wealthy believe bitcoin will only keep going up in value over time. Historically, doing anything but hodling has caused major regret.The internet is littered with cautionary tales. See: my ~$2.5 million Oktoberfest experience, or even more painfully, Bitcoin Pizza. On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas from Papa Johnxe2x80x99s for 10,000 BTC. At the time, those 10,000 BTC were worth $41. Today, theyxe2x80x99d be worth $645 million.  The examples are painful and comical, but itxe2x80x99s a genuine problem: therexe2x80x99s nearly $1.2 trillion in wealth tied up in a currency that people donxe2x80x99t feel comfortable spending. BlockFi solves that by offering USD loans collateralized by bitcoin at rates as low as 4.5% APR. BlockFi is able to offer competitive rates while protecting its downside by holding onto your bitcoin (or ETH, Litecoin, or PAXG) as collateral. Loans start at a 50% Loan to Value (LTV), meaning that you need to put up bitcoin that are worth twice as much as youxe2x80x99re borrowing. If you want a $100k loan, you need to put up 3.12 BTC, currently worth $200k. If the price of bitcoin crashes, that gives BlockFi a 50% cushion. If the price drops below certain thresholds, it will ask borrowers to post more collateral. In the worst case scenario, it can liquidate some of your bitcoin to cover the loan. That said, even in the sharp drawdown in March 2020, it didnxe2x80x99t have to liquidate any clients, while DeFi protocols like Maker did. Thatxe2x80x99s good, because selling into a massive selloff is typically the worst thing you can do. This highlights an important and obvious distinction between DeFi and CeFi: CeFi companies have teams of real people who can proactively work with clients to get ahead of issues before getting to the point at which a liquidation needs to occur. Protocols have dashboards and warning signs, but not customer support and risk teams whose job it is to avoid catastrophe. Everything is a trade-off. DeFi protocols typically have lower fees and are more open and transparent. Many people believe in xe2x80x9cnot your keys, not your coins,xe2x80x9d the idea that if you keep your coins in a centralized account, you donxe2x80x99t really control them. (Balaji made this point in an excellent Tim Ferriss Show interview.) Plus, one personxe2x80x99s comfort in having people on the other side is anotherxe2x80x99s discomfort in having people on the other side. For BlockFixe2x80x99s target customers and institutional partners, though, the trade-off can be worth it. BlockFi has a 0% loss ratio on loans. Itxe2x80x99s the lower risk option. BlockFi Interest AccountUp to this point, everything feels pretty normal: no-fee trading, credit cards with 1.5% back, and collateralized loans at 4.5% APR are things wexe2x80x99re used to. BlockFi just does it all with crypto. The BlockFi Interest Account is normally where people start to give me quizzical looks, because BlockFi offers up to 8.6% APY on stablecoins and 6% APY on bitcoin. Thatxe2x80x99s an insanely high rate, and it makes a huge difference. Over 30 years, $100k at 8.6% APY turns into $1,188,214. At the standard 0.01% APY I earn at Bank of America, it turns into $100,300. Obviously, there is no free lunch, and there is especially no free lunch over thirty years. The biggest risk with BlockFi is that its accounts are not FDIC insured. If BlockFi gets totally wiped out, your money is gone. Therexe2x80x99s a trade-off: for accepting more risk, you earn higher interest. BlockFi takes that risk very seriously. Watch this video with the companyxe2x80x99s Chief Risk Officer Rene van Kesteren, a former Managing Director in Equity Structured Finance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to understand how they think about it. Stillxe2x80xa6 8.6% is a lot. It beggars belief. I didnxe2x80x99t understand it at all, which is why I wanted to write this piece in the first place, to dive in and see if I could figure it out and explain it. Here goes. Remember from earlier that banks want to pay high interest rates. It attracts deposits, which enable more lending, which makes more money. A lot of challenger banks will even pay unsustainably high rates on deposits as a customer acquisition cost (CAC) in the form of a bonus rate on top. Those are typically limited to some period of time, like the first six months, after which you go back to earning normal APY. BlockFi is not a bank (technically, itxe2x80x99s a secured non-bank lender), but it makes money like one. Itxe2x80x99s able to offer 8.6% APY on stablecoin deposits and 6% on BTC not as an introductory offer, but because it is able to make a lot more than that on its loans. According to crypto research and media firm The Block, BlockFi was running a 10% average weighted APR on its retail loans in early 2021. That leaves plenty of room for 8.6% APY on stablecoins, especially when blended with lower rates on other assets. These rates are not directly tied to crypto prices; most of BlockFixe2x80x99s life has been during a bear market. Theyxe2x80x99re based on the availability of arbitrages. Hedge funds can generate high, nearly-riskless returns on certain trades if they can get leverage, and banks wonxe2x80x99t make the loans, so funds are happy to pay BlockFi rates that make 8.6% APY accounts possible. The main arbitrage is something called a basis trade.A basis trade is the purchase of an underlying asset and the sale of a related derivative, like a future. You make money on a basis trade as the price of the underlying asset and the derivative converge. In this case, bitcoin futures, which trade on traditional commodities exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or smaller futures exchanges like Deribit, trade at a significant premium to the xe2x80x9cspotxe2x80x9d price of bitcoin, which is the price that youxe2x80x99d pay if you went into the market right now and bought bitcoin. When a commodityxe2x80x99s futures price is higher than the spot price, itxe2x80x99s called contango. Typically, contango occurs when investors believe the price of something will be worth more in the future than it is today. In the oil markets, for example, that could happen if people expect a very cold winter in a few months, and want to lock in a price. With normal commodities like oil, youxe2x80x99re OK paying a premium on the futures because owning the futures means you donxe2x80x99t have to take delivery of actual barrels of oil and store them somewhere until the winter. Bitcoin, of course, costs practically nothing to hold, and yet, at the time of writing, June BTC futures are trading at a 46.4% premium to spot on Deribit.A hedge fund can buy bitcoins today at $63k and sell an equal amount of futures contracts for $67.5k, sit there while time passes, and collect the difference. Bloombergxe2x80x99s Joe Weisenthal gives the example of December futures trading on the CME at $63,000 last Friday while Bitcoin was at $58,300. In either case, the ~45% annualized return comes from rolling 3m futures four times per year.Weisenthal wrote, xe2x80x9cWhat this means is in theory (I stress, *in theory*) you could go long spot bitcoin, while shorting the December future, and if you just wait for the two to converge, thatxe2x80x99s an easy 8% in 12 months.xe2x80x9d (Note: I think he meant an easy 8% in eight months). That is (again, in theory) free money, a riskless trade2. Hedge funds love finding riskless trades. They can borrow tons of money, xe2x80x9clever up,xe2x80x9d and make way more than 8%. And the 8% number is relatively low. JP Morgan rate derivatives strategist Josh Younger put out a report last Friday saying that the xe2x80x9cJune CME contract was offering a 25% annualized yield relative to spot.xe2x80x9d Normally, when therexe2x80x99s nearly free money lying around, it doesnxe2x80x99t stick around for too long. It gets xe2x80x9carbitraged away.xe2x80x9d In this case, that would mean enough people borrow money to buy bitcoin, and enough people sell the futures contract, that the spread between the two compresses to next to nothing. But in this case, thatxe2x80x99s not really happening, for a couple reasons: What Institutions Can Buy. Some big, traditional financial institutions canxe2x80x99t really go to Binance or even Coinbase to buy large amounts of bitcoin, but theyxe2x80x99re very used to buying commodities futures on the CME, so they buy up futures, bidding up the price.Who Lends Money for Crypto Trades. Arbitrageurs want to borrow to lever up on the trade in a big way, but banks donxe2x80x99t like to lend money for crypto trades. Thatxe2x80x99s BlockFixe2x80x99s opportunity. As Matthew Leising wrote in Bloomberg: Some of the largest non-bank firms in cryptocurrency including BitGo, BlockFi, Galaxy Digital and Genesis are stepping up to meet investor demand for dollars amid a long-standing weariness by banks to lend to individuals or companies associated with Bitcoin and other digital assets. In this case, theyxe2x80x99re lending to hedge funds that need cash to buy Bitcoin for a trade that is almost guaranteed to pay out at annualized returns that have recently hit 20% to 40%.Banks wonxe2x80x99t lend to hedge funds on a free money trade because it stinks of crypto, and neither they nor their shareholders want anything to do with crypto (for now). BlockFi, which is crypto-native and understands the market as well as anyone, is more comfortable with the risk and is very willing to lend hedge funds the money for the basis trade at the right price.Banks wonxe2x80x99t lend to BlockFi to turn around and lend to hedge funds to make the basis trade, so where does BlockFi get the money to lend? You guessed it. Deposits. Specifically, stablecoin deposits.Wait, what are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that peg their value to some external reference, often USD. They allow funds to dollar denominate trades on the blockchain.  The best explanation Ixe2x80x99ve come across is that stablecoins are just tokenized dollars. In the case of one of the most popular, USD Coin, xe2x80x9ctokenizing USD into USDC is a three-step process:1) A user sends USD to the token issuer's bank account.2) The issuer uses USDC smart contract to create an equivalent amount of USDC.3) The newly minted USDC are delivered to the user, while the substituted US dollars are held in reserve.xe2x80x9dStablecoins are regular dollars that are compatible with the blockchain, and are typically backed by actual dollars in an account. Theyxe2x80x99re important here because hedge funds need them to make sure the basis trade is actually delta neutral. If the trade is dollar-denominated, meaning prices are all quoted in dollars, theyxe2x80x99re not taking currency risk, or a directional bet on where bitcoin ends up. Thatxe2x80x99s why BlockFi is able to pay 8.6% on stablecoin deposits. (They automatically turn your USD into stablecoins when you deposit money via ACH). BlockFi lends out stablecoin deposits to hedge funds to lever up on the basis trade. If hedge funds are able to pay BlockFi 15% because theyxe2x80x99re making 40%, BlockFi can afford to pay depositors 8.6%. This trade wonxe2x80x99t last forever, and the 8.6% rate will likely come down in the long run, although itxe2x80x99s been stable at 8.6% for many months. A few things may happen to tweak the trade in the short-term:Demand for bitcoin and bitcoin futures may decline. There is historically high bitcoin demand right now, and if that decreases, there will be less premium on the futures, which means less juice to be arbed.Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs are coming -- there are three in Canada already. That will have opposing impacts on the trade. On the one hand, it will make it easier to run the trade, which would mean more demand for dollar-denominated loans. On the other, it will decrease the demand for futures, which may tighten the spread and make the trade less profitable. It will be interesting to watch where that nets out. More Lenders Come Into the Space. Over time, assuming crypto keeps getting bigger and more legitimized, new startups, existing competitors, decentralized protocols, and big banks will all compete to lend money against crypto trades. In a low-rate environment, companies donxe2x80x99t just let other companies take all of the juicy yield for themselves. As the supply of dollars available to run the arb increases, rates come down.That said, even if the basis trade goes away, BlockFi is still able to earn more than 8.6% by lending out dollars for crypto-backed loans, and therexe2x80x99s still a massive gap between what people want to borrow to buy crypto and what theyxe2x80x99re able to borrow: Rachel @tolstoybbApril 8th 2021It will take some time for the basis trade to get arbitraged away, and crypto is still the wild west. New opportunities are popping up all of the time that a crypto-native financial institution like BlockFi is better equipped to understand and move quickly on than traditional ones. Even today, the basis trade is just one of the things BlockFi does in order to pay out seemingly-too-good-to-be-true rates. The rates arenxe2x80x99t based on any one specific trade, but on BlockFixe2x80x99s ability to accumulate and lend crypto assets for which therexe2x80x99s more demand than supply. Stablecoins are the most in-demand because theyxe2x80x99re needed to dollar denominate all sorts of trades, but BlockFi offers competitive rates on 10 crypto-assets. Rates are based on how much BlockFi can generate by lending each type of asset out, which is based on supply and demand. Putting one BTC or ETH in if you have them pays out 6%, but it tiers down to a more standard 0.5% from there as you deposit more because there isnxe2x80x99t as much demand to borrow bitcoin or ETH. While stablecoin rates have remained consistent, bitcoin APYxe2x80x99s on BlockFi have come down recently as the most profitable trade -- Grayscale -- went away. There are all sorts of reasons someone might want to borrow bitcoin, including shorting (although therexe2x80x99s not much demand for that today outside of hedging), but the biggest was to arb the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium to NAV. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is one of the few indirect ways (i.e. not owning bitcoin) for people to get bitcoin exposure. It holds bitcoin in a trust, and then sells shares in the trust in the stock market. Like futures, GBTC traded at a premium to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bitcoin it held because people could buy it more easily, in ways that they were used to, than bitcoin itself. I can buy shares of GBTC in my Schwab account or 401k. To many, that feels safer, and it comes with tax advantages. (AltoIRA lets you own crypto in your IRA directly, FYI.) As a result, GBTC has traded in a 5% - 30% premium to NAV range over the past couple of years.Institutions took advantage of that premium. The way GBTC works is that people and institutions can put Bitcoin in the Trust, keep it there for six months, and then get GBTC shares which they could turn around and sell to retail buyers at that 5-30% premium. Same story: nearly riskeless trade, borrow bitcoin to exploit it, profit. 5-30% premium in six months meant 10-60% annualized returns, boosted by margin. In order to borrow bitcoin, they turned to BlockFi. BlockFi generated strong yield from the trade, which they gave to depositors in the form of high yields on bitcoin. Over the past couple of months, though, the GBTC premium turned into a discount as buyers got new ways to get bitcoin exposure indirectly: like Tesla and Square, which hold BTC on the balance sheet, Microstrategy, which holds so much bitcoin on its balance sheet itxe2x80x99s essentially a BTC ETF, and three Canadian Bitcoin ETFs, launched in the past couple months, already have $1.3 billion in assets under management. BlockFi itself launched its own Bitcoin Trust. More supply for the same indirect bitcoin demand meant lower GBTC prices. With no premium, and a discount in its place, the demand to borrow bitcoin to put in the trust went away. As a result, BlockFi lowered its bitcoin APY. The Grayscale illustrates two things: that BlockFixe2x80x99s rates may come down over time, but also that it has a diversified enough business that itxe2x80x99s not reliant on any one trade at a given time. As long as there are new, legitimate trades that investors want to borrow crypto to put on, BlockFi will be able to generate enough yield to pay out above-market interest on deposits. The question is: can it expand from that wedge into the full suite of financial institution services faster than competitors can get comfortable with crypto? A smooth and familiar interface, crypto-backed loans, and legit high interest rates have propelled BlockFi to dizzying heights in less than four years: $50 million in monthly revenue with $15 billion in deposits and a $3 billion valuation. According to The Block, BlockFi was already profitable entering 2021. But this is just the early stage of BlockFixe2x80x99s master plan to reimagine what a modern financial institution looks like on crypto rails. In its report, BlockFi Company Intelligence, The Block wrote: From one perspective, BlockFi can be viewed as one of the world's largest crypto-native neobanks: part non-bank crypto-secured (collateral) lender, part digital asset depository institution. But even that framing provides an incomplete picture.What BlockFi is building, according to its CEO Zac Prince, is a lot like a crypto-native SoFi plus the prime brokerage desk of a large bank like JP Morgan. SoFi started with student loans as its wedge into a young, underserved customer base, and has expanded what it can offer those customers. Today, in addition to student loans, SoFi offers cash management, a credit card, stock and crypto trading, personal loans, home loans, auto loan refinancing, credit tracking, and life insurance. SoFi, which invested in BlockFixe2x80x99s seed round, recently announced a merger with one of Chamath Palihapityaxe2x80x99s SPACs (IPOE). Itxe2x80x99s currently trading around a $13 billion market cap. Similarly, BlockFi started with crypto loans as its wedge to attract a wave of newly wealthy crypto investors who were underserved by the market to make deposits. Theyxe2x80x99ve added no-fee trading and a credit card, and will continue to roll out new product lines. Itxe2x80x99s not hard to imagine cash management, stock trading, wealth management, mortgages, and all of the financial services that crypto holders might need, all built on crypto rails. Now, itxe2x80x99s trying to expand its addressable market by building more on-ramps that make it easy for crypto curious people to get involved in the space. An 8.6% APY is one way to pique peoplesxe2x80x99 interest, but credit cards and other products that let people easily earn and grow their crypto holdings without feeling like theyxe2x80x99re dealing with crypto will unlock new client bases. But the race is on. As a public company with an $86 billion market cap, Coinbase is undoubtedly going to expand its offering to try to infiltrate more of its customersxe2x80x99 financial lives. It already launched bitcoin-backed loans last August. DeFi is still confusing and hard to use, but itxe2x80x99s improving rapidly and attracting more people beyond the hardcore crypto community. Projects like Aave and Compound offer lower fees and more decentralization than BlockFi. Non-crypto companies like Square, Fidelity, Monzo, Robinhood, Mastercard, PayPal/Venmo, and even SoFi are moving into BlockFixe2x80x99s space: Square said 1 million customers bought Bitcoin in January, and it holds over 3,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet Robinhood said that 9.5 million people traded crypto on its app in Q1 PayPal lets customers buy, sell, and hold cryptoPayPalxe2x80x99s Venmo will let people pay each other in cryptoMastercard is supporting crypto on its network Visa built a crypto API that itxe2x80x99s piloting with neobanks. The list goes on, and new runners are entering the race every day. Many of these companies have more robust financial services offerings than BlockFi, and are betting that adding crypto into the mix is enough to retain existing users and attract some new ones. BlockFixe2x80x99s bet is that crypto, or at least digital currency, is just better than the existing financial system in a lot of ways that have nothing to do with decentralization, and that CeFi, which combines the benefits of centralization and digital money, is the winning combo. Software is eating the world, and at some point, they think crypto will eat the way we store and exchange money by building money directly into the infrastructure itself. If that turns out to be wrong, or in a more extreme case, if bitcoin crashes and BlockFixe2x80x99s clients and counterparties explode, BlockFi could struggle, and therexe2x80x99s no FDIC to back up its deposits.But if thatxe2x80x99s true, if crypto is fundamental to building better financial products, then BlockFixe2x80x99s wedge and singular focus on crypto will be an advantage versus incumbents and startups that try to add it on after the fact. Robinhood, for example, doesnxe2x80x99t even let users transfer crypto outside of the app. If people accept that money moves more easily and equitably on crypto rails, bolt-on solutions built for speculation wonxe2x80x99t cut it. If theyxe2x80x99re right, and CeFi wins, the battle may end up being BlockFi vs. Coinbase. BlockFi board member Anthony xe2x80x9cPompxe2x80x9d Pompliano believes that BlockFixe2x80x99s decision to start with deposits gives it a clearer path to product expansion, drawing on Robinhood vs. Square: Robinhood remains a brokerage-focused business. They have tried to scale by adding new products (crypto trading, cash accounts, etc), but that appears to be a much more difficult road than originally anticipated. Square on the other hand has been able to build a serious ecosystem of products that includes payment infrastructure, point-of-sale technology, CashApp, Bitcoin brokerage, and fractional share brokerage for public equities.The not-so-subtle implication is that Coinbase is Robinhood and BlockFi is Square, and that BlockFi can build Coinbase before Coinbase can build BlockFi. Coinbasexe2x80x99s IPO just adds fuel to the fire. More companies will enter the space. Spreads will get arbitraged away. Yields will compress. 8.6% APY wonxe2x80x99t last forever, but if BlockFi can build a robust suite of financial services with crypto tools for an expanding base of crypto owners, it has a shot at building a lasting institution in a competitive and lucrative space. BlockFi is offering Not Boring readers up to $250 in free bitcoin for opening up and funding an account.

Front end rates are anchored by the fed funds rate which is 0.25-0.5% now. Deposits from retail clients are basically overnight unsecured lending to the bank which is why theyxe2x80x99re near 0%; 2) Liquidity trap from years of low interest rates. Borrowers are not borrowing not because they donxe2x80x99t want to but because they already are saddled with debt. Corp debt is high, consumer debt is high. There is just no more room to borrow more.Theoretically not free money.

Todayxe2x80x99s post couldnxe2x80x99t have been timed any better. Ixe2x80x99ve been talking to the BlockFi team for a couple of months, and we picked April 15th about a month ago. We didnxe2x80x99t know that Coinbase would be IPOxe2x80x99ing yesterday, or that Ixe2x80x99d be so deep down the crypto rabbit hole at this point. Itxe2x80x99s fate. This is a Sponsored Deep Dive on a company Ixe2x80x99ve been wanting to dig into for a long time. BlockFi offers up to 8.6% APY on deposits, which is obviously tempting and also confounding. Ixe2x80x99ve had so many text conversations with friends that go something like, xe2x80x9cI want to do this, but it has to be bullshit, right? How does that even work? We need you to do a Not Boring on this.xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99m happy to report that it is not bullshit, and I have the receipts to prove it.Letxe2x80x99s get to it.Coinbase IPOxe2x80x99d yesterday to wild success. After touching $420.69 and going as high as $429.54, it closed at $328.28, up 31% from its reference price of $250. It peaked at a market cap of over $100 billion, and closed at $86 billion. Ixe2x80x99m more excited about BlockFi, though, and not because theyxe2x80x99re sponsoring this post. Itxe2x80x99s a more selfish reason, one that makes the sponsorship money seem like peanuts. See, if BlockFi existed in 2013 instead of Coinbase, I probably wouldnxe2x80x99t even be writing this newsletter. On May 16, 2013, when Coinbase was less than a year old, I set up an account and bought my first bitcoin. I forget why, but I just looked up when Union Square Ventures first invested, and that must have been it: That was good enough for me. I bought 10 BTC on May 16th, another 15 on June 14th, and another 13 on July 12th. That September, after quitting my job in finance, I flew my unemployed ass to Oktoberfest for a fun weekend with a few friends. On September 24th, after ten too many steins, I woke up in my Munich hotel room a little hungover and feeling dumb for spending so much on the trip and the night out... and made the stupidest financial decision of my life. I just sold some of those silly bitcoin Ixe2x80x99d bought, and bingo, free Oktoberfest. It felt like such an obviously responsible thing to do that three days later, I sold ten more, then I sold eight in October, five in November, and the last five in May (for a nice little 4x, I might add!). I sold all 38 bitcoins for a total of $7,232. At current prices, those 38 bitcoins are worth $2,450,050. Gulp. If BlockFi had been around at the time, I could have taken out a USD loan against some of those bitcoin and earned interest on the rest while they sat safely in my account. If BlockFi paid interest on bitcoin that whole time, like they do today, Ixe2x80x99d have more than 40 bitcoin today, or over $2.6 million. Double gulp.  Ixe2x80x99ve told you before that Ixe2x80x99m an idiot, and I wasnxe2x80x99t kidding. But thatxe2x80x99s enough self-chastising for one day. Wexe2x80x99re here to talk about BlockFi.BlockFi, which just announced a $350 million Series D led by Bain Capital Ventures, Pomp Investments, Tiger Global, and partners of DST Global, is building a full-fledged financial institution for crypto investors. BlockFi offers four products to retail investors: BlockFi Interest Account (at rates up to 8.6% APY)Trading AccountsCrypto-Backed LoansCredit CardIt also acts as a prime broker for institutional clients, with custody, financing, execution, and margin. BlockFi is building SoFi plus JP Morganxe2x80x99s prime broker desk, for crypto. Therexe2x80x99s a race going on among everyone in the financial services space -- centralized crypto companies like BlockFi and Coinbase, neobanks like Chime and Monzo, public fintech companies like Square and PayPal/Venmo, and large brokerages and banks -- to become the financial super-app, the place that customers go for loans, credit cards, trading, insurance, cash management, and more. BlockFi has a unique wedge: a growing suite of products that earn clients high interest rates and free crypto.The first question anyone has when they hear about BlockFi is: xe2x80x9cWhatxe2x80x99s the catch? 8.6% APY sounds too good to be true. That canxe2x80x99t be legit.xe2x80x9d I went DEEP to understand how they do it, and itxe2x80x99s legit. Essentially, BlockFi arbitrages the fact that traditional finance and crypto donxe2x80x99t like to deal with each other. To understand how it works, wexe2x80x99re going back down the crypto rabbit hole. Wexe2x80x99ll cover topics like bitcoin, stablecoins, DeFi, and CeFi, and basis trades. Youxe2x80x99ve probably heard the terms, but probably, like me, didnxe2x80x99t fully understand what they mean. Wexe2x80x99ll change that. At the very least, wexe2x80x99ll all sound smarter at our next party.Therexe2x80x99s so much to dig into here that itxe2x80x99s hard to know where to start, but wexe2x80x99re going to try:What Does a Bank Do? What BlockFi DoesStablecoins and 8.6% APYGrayscale Bitcoin TrustThe Race to the Finance Super AppThe OfferAfter doing the research for this piece, I moved some of my money into stablecoins on BlockFi, and transferred all of my (much, much smaller than 2013) bitcoin holdings to BlockFi from Coinbase. Yesterday, I was on a YouTube livestream with Ben Carlson talking about the Coinbase IPO, and unprompted, he said that hexe2x80x99d done the same. If you want to check it out for yourself, sign up with the Not Boring link to get up to $250 in free bitcoin when you fund your account. Try BlockFiIf youxe2x80x99re still wondering what BlockFi is and how it pulls off such high rates, keep reading. Therexe2x80x99s a lot to learn. Letxe2x80x99s start somewhere obviousxe2x80xa6 Banks make money in three main ways: Net Interest Margin. Customers deposit money. Banks lend that money out to other people and businesses at a certain rate, pay depositors a lower rate, and keep the difference.Interchange. When you use a credit or debit card at a store, the store pays your bank and its bank, typically as a percentage of the transaction and a small fixed amount. Fees. Banks charge customers money when they overdraft, take money out of an ATM, and for all sorts of other things. For our purposes, Net Interest Margin is the most important. Itxe2x80x99s the spread between what banks pay on deposits and what they earn on loans. Letxe2x80x99s do the math on a mortgage as an example.Right now, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on a standard Bank of America bank account is 0.01%. Letxe2x80x99s assume they can lend money to a homebuyer on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 3.0%. Bank of Americaxe2x80x99s Net Interest Margin is 3% - 0.01% = 2.99%. Itxe2x80x99s not that banks want to pay next to nothing on deposits. Itxe2x80x99s just that with low rates across the board, banks arenxe2x80x99t able to pay much more and make enough net interest margin to pay for overhead and still generate enough profit to keep shareholders happy. When they could lend money at a higher rate (30-year mortgage rates were 18% in the early xe2x80x9880s), savings accounts paid higher rates too. Banks would love to pay high interest rates on deposits. Banks compete with all of the different things you can do with your money -- buy a house, stocks, or crypto, pay off loans, travel. The higher the interest rate, the more likely you are to keep your money sitting there. More money sitting there means the banks can lend more means higher income for the banks. Given the low rates they earn from borrowers, they just canxe2x80x99t.1BlockFi, however, can. Founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez in 2017, BlockFi is a crypto-native financial institution. But while BlockFi is for crypto investors, itxe2x80x99s not decentralized. It has over 700 employees, a headquarters in Jersey City, and is regulated. On the spectrum between a traditional financial institution (xe2x80x9cTradFixe2x80x9d) and a Decentralized Finance (xe2x80x9cDeFixe2x80x9d) protocol, it falls somewhere in the middle. Like Coinbase, itxe2x80x99s whatxe2x80x99s known as Centralized Finance (xe2x80x9cCeFixe2x80x9d).To a client, BlockFi looks and feels like an online bank. When I set up my account, it felt very much like setting up a regular online bank account. I signed up, verified my identity, and waited a day for everything to get approved. Once I was in, I connected to my bank account via Plaid and deposited money via ACH. The money hit my account instantly and BlockFi converted it to GUSD (a stablecoin). Without me doing anything special or crypto-y, itxe2x80x99s now earning 8.6% APY. With Flex, I chose what currency I get interest paid in. So I deposited in USD, converted automatically to stablecoin, and get 8.6% interest paid out in ETH. Then, I transferred my BTC from Coinbase. It took about two minutes, and now Ixe2x80x99m earning 6% APY on that, in bitcoin. (Rates vary by coin deposited)Within two days of starting the process, I now have a meaningful amount of my net worth in BlockFi. I wouldnxe2x80x99t recommend it if I didnxe2x80x99t trust it for myself. And it was easy. That familiar bank feeling with backend crypto superpowers is by design. Early BlockFi clients were crypto natives (they had to be to use a new crypto-based product during crypto winter), but the company is making a push to attract crypto-curious clients, kind of like us. They want to be the on-ramp for millions of people to get involved with crypto. A couple of interesting things happened in the setup process: It Felt Like a Regular Bank. BlockFixe2x80x99s on-ramp to crypto feels smooth and familiar. Crypto Superpowers. I transferred a good chunk of money from Coinbase to BlockFi in minutes, not the hours or days it would take to send a wire or transfer money between accounts. BlockFi thinks that instant settlement gives it a big advantage over traditional financial institutions. That combination of ease and power is working. In early March, BlockFi announced a $350 million Series D that valued the company at $3 billion. Traditional venture/hedge funds Bain Capital Ventures, Tiger Global, and DST Global joined crypto-focused Pomp Investments as co-leads. At the time of the announcement, the company announced some eye-popping stats:$50 million in monthly revenue, up from $1.5 million a year earlier$15 billion in assets on the platform, up from $1 billion a year earlier0% loss rate across its lending portfolio 50% month-over month growth $50 million per month is an absurd amount of money for a company thatxe2x80x99s less than four years old. It would be a great annual revenue number for a company that age. BlockFi generates revenue in three (soon to be four) ways: BlockFi Interest Account: Earn up to 8.6% APY on stablecoin deposits, 6% on BTC, and 5.25% on ETH.Trading Accounts: No fee trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesCrypto-Backed Loans: Loans on crypto balances as low as 4.5% APRCredit Card: Visa credit card with 1.5% bitcoin back on every purchase (coming soon)These look a lot like the ways that banks make money. Letxe2x80x99s break down each, saving the most complex for last. Trading AccountsBlockFi lets clients buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The product is similar to Coinbase in that itxe2x80x99s a centralized and easy-to-use way to buy crypto, but there are a couple key differences. Coinbase Offers More Currencies. Because Coinbasexe2x80x99s business is all about buying and selling crypto, it offers a lot more assets than BlockFi. You can buy nine assets on BlockFi, and 44 on Coinbase. While BlockFi will add more assets over time, itxe2x80x99s not the focus of the business. Trading on BlockFi is really about giving people a way to build up crypto deposits that BlockFi can lend out, and it only offers trading in coins that it lends. BlockFi Has Lower Fees. Coinbase makes most of its money by charging retail traders fees. Coinbase charges normal accounts 3-4% transaction fees per trade, plus a spread on top. That drops to 0.5% plus a spread for Coinbase Pro accounts. It nets out to a 1.25-1.5% take rate on retail trades. Institutions pay much less, around 0.05%.In Coinbase and the cryptoeconomy, Tanay Jaipuria wrote: Over 95% of the revenue that Coinbase generates comes from transaction revenue, i.e., commissions on trades from retail and institutional clients, so letxe2x80x99s focus on that. Digging one level further, Coinbasexe2x80x99s institutional trading volume makes up about 60% of total volume. However, Coinbase makes 95% of its transaction revenue (and 90% of its total revenue) from retail trading volume.BlockFi does not charge transaction fees, but it does take a spread on trades that averages at around 1%. Itxe2x80x99s cheaper than Coinbase, but more expensive than  exchanges like Binance and FTX that are more powerful but harder to use, particularly for people new to crypto.Importantly, like Coinbase, FTX, Binance, Uniswap, and other exchanges, but unlike non-crypto platforms like Robinhood and PayPal, BlockFi lets you move your coins in and out. At this point, trading is a feature on BlockFi, not a full standalone product. Itxe2x80x99s a way to onboard people to crypto and get them earning yield. Bitcoin Rewards Credit CardBlockFi is launching a credit card, with Visa, that feels like a regular credit card in every way -- you can use it everywhere -- except that it gives you 1.5% back in Bitcoin whenever you use it, and up to $750 or more in bonus bitcoin rewards. This one is straightforward. Credit card providers earn an annual fee and interchange, and itxe2x80x99s up to them to use it in a way that attracts customers and strengthens the business. Traditionally, thatxe2x80x99s meant points, miles, or cash back. In Rampxe2x80x99s Double-Unicorn Rounds, I wrote that instead of points: ...it rewards them with better software. Better software drives more usage, which drives more revenue, which drives better software, and so on. The faster the flywheel turns, the further ahead Ramp pulls. The same principle is at play here. Instead of points or cash back, BlockFi gives people bitcoin. It seems like a minor distinction, but itxe2x80x99s potentially massive, for two reasons. One, theyxe2x80x99re rewards that can increase in value over time. If youxe2x80x99re bullish on bitcoin, then you believe the rewards you earn will be worth more in the future. Youxe2x80x99re getting long bitcoin every time you buy anything. (Of course, they can also go down over time). Two, bitcoin rewards are an on-ramp. There are a lot of people who donxe2x80x99t want to spend their hard-earned cash buying bitcoin, or feel uncomfortable depositing money in an account and trading it for bitcoin. Those same people might be happy to just get free bitcoin for doing something theyxe2x80x99d be doing anyway. Once they do, it kicks off BlockFixe2x80x99s money flywheel: Earn bitcoinBitcoin automatically deposited in BlockFi account, BlockFi lends it outClient earns 6% on bitcoin holdings in bitcoin, building up the stackClient can take USD loans against that bitcoin The bitcoin credit card is an on-ramp, a way to get the next 15 million people to dip their toes in crypto. Itxe2x80x99s an on-ramp to BlockFi, too, and likely a low CAC one - who doesnxe2x80x99t want free bitcoin? Once clients are in the ecosystem, BlockFi can monetize them in all sorts of ways as it builds out more financial institution functionality. Crypto-Backed LoansTherexe2x80x99s this tension in crypto: thousands of people have made millions of dollars by buying and hodling bitcoin, ETH, and other coins. On-chain, theyxe2x80x99re very wealthy. But to actually use that wealth to buy things, they need to sell coins. Thatxe2x80x99s a problem, because selling triggers capital gains taxes in the US, and because most crypto-wealthy believe bitcoin will only keep going up in value over time. Historically, doing anything but hodling has caused major regret.The internet is littered with cautionary tales. See: my ~$2.5 million Oktoberfest experience, or even more painfully, Bitcoin Pizza. On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas from Papa Johnxe2x80x99s for 10,000 BTC. At the time, those 10,000 BTC were worth $41. Today, theyxe2x80x99d be worth $645 million.  The examples are painful and comical, but itxe2x80x99s a genuine problem: therexe2x80x99s nearly $1.2 trillion in wealth tied up in a currency that people donxe2x80x99t feel comfortable spending. BlockFi solves that by offering USD loans collateralized by bitcoin at rates as low as 4.5% APR. BlockFi is able to offer competitive rates while protecting its downside by holding onto your bitcoin (or ETH, Litecoin, or PAXG) as collateral. Loans start at a 50% Loan to Value (LTV), meaning that you need to put up bitcoin that are worth twice as much as youxe2x80x99re borrowing. If you want a $100k loan, you need to put up 3.12 BTC, currently worth $200k. If the price of bitcoin crashes, that gives BlockFi a 50% cushion. If the price drops below certain thresholds, it will ask borrowers to post more collateral. In the worst case scenario, it can liquidate some of your bitcoin to cover the loan. That said, even in the sharp drawdown in March 2020, it didnxe2x80x99t have to liquidate any clients, while DeFi protocols like Maker did. Thatxe2x80x99s good, because selling into a massive selloff is typically the worst thing you can do. This highlights an important and obvious distinction between DeFi and CeFi: CeFi companies have teams of real people who can proactively work with clients to get ahead of issues before getting to the point at which a liquidation needs to occur. Protocols have dashboards and warning signs, but not customer support and risk teams whose job it is to avoid catastrophe. Everything is a trade-off. DeFi protocols typically have lower fees and are more open and transparent. Many people believe in xe2x80x9cnot your keys, not your coins,xe2x80x9d the idea that if you keep your coins in a centralized account, you donxe2x80x99t really control them. (Balaji made this point in an excellent Tim Ferriss Show interview.) Plus, one personxe2x80x99s comfort in having people on the other side is anotherxe2x80x99s discomfort in having people on the other side. For BlockFixe2x80x99s target customers and institutional partners, though, the trade-off can be worth it. BlockFi has a 0% loss ratio on loans. Itxe2x80x99s the lower risk option. BlockFi Interest AccountUp to this point, everything feels pretty normal: no-fee trading, credit cards with 1.5% back, and collateralized loans at 4.5% APR are things wexe2x80x99re used to. BlockFi just does it all with crypto. The BlockFi Interest Account is normally where people start to give me quizzical looks, because BlockFi offers up to 8.6% APY on stablecoins and 6% APY on bitcoin. Thatxe2x80x99s an insanely high rate, and it makes a huge difference. Over 30 years, $100k at 8.6% APY turns into $1,188,214. At the standard 0.01% APY I earn at Bank of America, it turns into $100,300. Obviously, there is no free lunch, and there is especially no free lunch over thirty years. The biggest risk with BlockFi is that its accounts are not FDIC insured. If BlockFi gets totally wiped out, your money is gone. Therexe2x80x99s a trade-off: for accepting more risk, you earn higher interest. BlockFi takes that risk very seriously. Watch this video with the companyxe2x80x99s Chief Risk Officer Rene van Kesteren, a former Managing Director in Equity Structured Finance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to understand how they think about it. Stillxe2x80xa6 8.6% is a lot. It beggars belief. I didnxe2x80x99t understand it at all, which is why I wanted to write this piece in the first place, to dive in and see if I could figure it out and explain it. Here goes. Remember from earlier that banks want to pay high interest rates. It attracts deposits, which enable more lending, which makes more money. A lot of challenger banks will even pay unsustainably high rates on deposits as a customer acquisition cost (CAC) in the form of a bonus rate on top. Those are typically limited to some period of time, like the first six months, after which you go back to earning normal APY. BlockFi is not a bank (technically, itxe2x80x99s a secured non-bank lender), but it makes money like one. Itxe2x80x99s able to offer 8.6% APY on stablecoin deposits and 6% on BTC not as an introductory offer, but because it is able to make a lot more than that on its loans. According to crypto research and media firm The Block, BlockFi was running a 10% average weighted APR on its retail loans in early 2021. That leaves plenty of room for 8.6% APY on stablecoins, especially when blended with lower rates on other assets. These rates are not directly tied to crypto prices; most of BlockFixe2x80x99s life has been during a bear market. Theyxe2x80x99re based on the availability of arbitrages. Hedge funds can generate high, nearly-riskless returns on certain trades if they can get leverage, and banks wonxe2x80x99t make the loans, so funds are happy to pay BlockFi rates that make 8.6% APY accounts possible. The main arbitrage is something called a basis trade.A basis trade is the purchase of an underlying asset and the sale of a related derivative, like a future. You make money on a basis trade as the price of the underlying asset and the derivative converge. In this case, bitcoin futures, which trade on traditional commodities exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or smaller futures exchanges like Deribit, trade at a significant premium to the xe2x80x9cspotxe2x80x9d price of bitcoin, which is the price that youxe2x80x99d pay if you went into the market right now and bought bitcoin. When a commodityxe2x80x99s futures price is higher than the spot price, itxe2x80x99s called contango. Typically, contango occurs when investors believe the price of something will be worth more in the future than it is today. In the oil markets, for example, that could happen if people expect a very cold winter in a few months, and want to lock in a price. With normal commodities like oil, youxe2x80x99re OK paying a premium on the futures because owning the futures means you donxe2x80x99t have to take delivery of actual barrels of oil and store them somewhere until the winter. Bitcoin, of course, costs practically nothing to hold, and yet, at the time of writing, June BTC futures are trading at a 46.4% premium to spot on Deribit.A hedge fund can buy bitcoins today at $63k and sell an equal amount of futures contracts for $67.5k, sit there while time passes, and collect the difference. Bloombergxe2x80x99s Joe Weisenthal gives the example of December futures trading on the CME at $63,000 last Friday while Bitcoin was at $58,300. In either case, the ~45% annualized return comes from rolling 3m futures four times per year.Weisenthal wrote, xe2x80x9cWhat this means is in theory (I stress, *in theory*) you could go long spot bitcoin, while shorting the December future, and if you just wait for the two to converge, thatxe2x80x99s an easy 8% in 12 months.xe2x80x9d (Note: I think he meant an easy 8% in eight months). That is (again, in theory) free money, a riskless trade2. Hedge funds love finding riskless trades. They can borrow tons of money, xe2x80x9clever up,xe2x80x9d and make way more than 8%. And the 8% number is relatively low. JP Morgan rate derivatives strategist Josh Younger put out a report last Friday saying that the xe2x80x9cJune CME contract was offering a 25% annualized yield relative to spot.xe2x80x9d Normally, when therexe2x80x99s nearly free money lying around, it doesnxe2x80x99t stick around for too long. It gets xe2x80x9carbitraged away.xe2x80x9d In this case, that would mean enough people borrow money to buy bitcoin, and enough people sell the futures contract, that the spread between the two compresses to next to nothing. But in this case, thatxe2x80x99s not really happening, for a couple reasons: What Institutions Can Buy. Some big, traditional financial institutions canxe2x80x99t really go to Binance or even Coinbase to buy large amounts of bitcoin, but theyxe2x80x99re very used to buying commodities futures on the CME, so they buy up futures, bidding up the price.Who Lends Money for Crypto Trades. Arbitrageurs want to borrow to lever up on the trade in a big way, but banks donxe2x80x99t like to lend money for crypto trades. Thatxe2x80x99s BlockFixe2x80x99s opportunity. As Matthew Leising wrote in Bloomberg: Some of the largest non-bank firms in cryptocurrency including BitGo, BlockFi, Galaxy Digital and Genesis are stepping up to meet investor demand for dollars amid a long-standing weariness by banks to lend to individuals or companies associated with Bitcoin and other digital assets. In this case, theyxe2x80x99re lending to hedge funds that need cash to buy Bitcoin for a trade that is almost guaranteed to pay out at annualized returns that have recently hit 20% to 40%.Banks wonxe2x80x99t lend to hedge funds on a free money trade because it stinks of crypto, and neither they nor their shareholders want anything to do with crypto (for now). BlockFi, which is crypto-native and understands the market as well as anyone, is more comfortable with the risk and is very willing to lend hedge funds the money for the basis trade at the right price.Banks wonxe2x80x99t lend to BlockFi to turn around and lend to hedge funds to make the basis trade, so where does BlockFi get the money to lend? You guessed it. Deposits. Specifically, stablecoin deposits.Wait, what are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that peg their value to some external reference, often USD. They allow funds to dollar denominate trades on the blockchain.  The best explanation Ixe2x80x99ve come across is that stablecoins are just tokenized dollars. In the case of one of the most popular, USD Coin, xe2x80x9ctokenizing USD into USDC is a three-step process:1) A user sends USD to the token issuer's bank account.2) The issuer uses USDC smart contract to create an equivalent amount of USDC.3) The newly minted USDC are delivered to the user, while the substituted US dollars are held in reserve.xe2x80x9dStablecoins are regular dollars that are compatible with the blockchain, and are typically backed by actual dollars in an account. Theyxe2x80x99re important here because hedge funds need them to make sure the basis trade is actually delta neutral. If the trade is dollar-denominated, meaning prices are all quoted in dollars, theyxe2x80x99re not taking currency risk, or a directional bet on where bitcoin ends up. Thatxe2x80x99s why BlockFi is able to pay 8.6% on stablecoin deposits. (They automatically turn your USD into stablecoins when you deposit money via ACH). BlockFi lends out stablecoin deposits to hedge funds to lever up on the basis trade. If hedge funds are able to pay BlockFi 15% because theyxe2x80x99re making 40%, BlockFi can afford to pay depositors 8.6%. This trade wonxe2x80x99t last forever, and the 8.6% rate will likely come down in the long run, although itxe2x80x99s been stable at 8.6% for many months. A few things may happen to tweak the trade in the short-term:Demand for bitcoin and bitcoin futures may decline. There is historically high bitcoin demand right now, and if that decreases, there will be less premium on the futures, which means less juice to be arbed.Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs are coming -- there are three in Canada already. That will have opposing impacts on the trade. On the one hand, it will make it easier to run the trade, which would mean more demand for dollar-denominated loans. On the other, it will decrease the demand for futures, which may tighten the spread and make the trade less profitable. It will be interesting to watch where that nets out. More Lenders Come Into the Space. Over time, assuming crypto keeps getting bigger and more legitimized, new startups, existing competitors, decentralized protocols, and big banks will all compete to lend money against crypto trades. In a low-rate environment, companies donxe2x80x99t just let other companies take all of the juicy yield for themselves. As the supply of dollars available to run the arb increases, rates come down.That said, even if the basis trade goes away, BlockFi is still able to earn more than 8.6% by lending out dollars for crypto-backed loans, and therexe2x80x99s still a massive gap between what people want to borrow to buy crypto and what theyxe2x80x99re able to borrow: Rachel @tolstoybbApril 8th 2021It will take some time for the basis trade to get arbitraged away, and crypto is still the wild west. New opportunities are popping up all of the time that a crypto-native financial institution like BlockFi is better equipped to understand and move quickly on than traditional ones. Even today, the basis trade is just one of the things BlockFi does in order to pay out seemingly-too-good-to-be-true rates. The rates arenxe2x80x99t based on any one specific trade, but on BlockFixe2x80x99s ability to accumulate and lend crypto assets for which therexe2x80x99s more demand than supply. Stablecoins are the most in-demand because theyxe2x80x99re needed to dollar denominate all sorts of trades, but BlockFi offers competitive rates on 10 crypto-assets. Rates are based on how much BlockFi can generate by lending each type of asset out, which is based on supply and demand. Putting one BTC or ETH in if you have them pays out 6%, but it tiers down to a more standard 0.5% from there as you deposit more because there isnxe2x80x99t as much demand to borrow bitcoin or ETH. While stablecoin rates have remained consistent, bitcoin APYxe2x80x99s on BlockFi have come down recently as the most profitable trade -- Grayscale -- went away. There are all sorts of reasons someone might want to borrow bitcoin, including shorting (although therexe2x80x99s not much demand for that today outside of hedging), but the biggest was to arb the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium to NAV. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is one of the few indirect ways (i.e. not owning bitcoin) for people to get bitcoin exposure. It holds bitcoin in a trust, and then sells shares in the trust in the stock market. Like futures, GBTC traded at a premium to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bitcoin it held because people could buy it more easily, in ways that they were used to, than bitcoin itself. I can buy shares of GBTC in my Schwab account or 401k. To many, that feels safer, and it comes with tax advantages. (AltoIRA lets you own crypto in your IRA directly, FYI.) As a result, GBTC has traded in a 5% - 30% premium to NAV range over the past couple of years.Institutions took advantage of that premium. The way GBTC works is that people and institutions can put Bitcoin in the Trust, keep it there for six months, and then get GBTC shares which they could turn around and sell to retail buyers at that 5-30% premium. Same story: nearly riskeless trade, borrow bitcoin to exploit it, profit. 5-30% premium in six months meant 10-60% annualized returns, boosted by margin. In order to borrow bitcoin, they turned to BlockFi. BlockFi generated strong yield from the trade, which they gave to depositors in the form of high yields on bitcoin. Over the past couple of months, though, the GBTC premium turned into a discount as buyers got new ways to get bitcoin exposure indirectly: like Tesla and Square, which hold BTC on the balance sheet, Microstrategy, which holds so much bitcoin on its balance sheet itxe2x80x99s essentially a BTC ETF, and three Canadian Bitcoin ETFs, launched in the past couple months, already have $1.3 billion in assets under management. BlockFi itself launched its own Bitcoin Trust. More supply for the same indirect bitcoin demand meant lower GBTC prices. With no premium, and a discount in its place, the demand to borrow bitcoin to put in the trust went away. As a result, BlockFi lowered its bitcoin APY. The Grayscale illustrates two things: that BlockFixe2x80x99s rates may come down over time, but also that it has a diversified enough business that itxe2x80x99s not reliant on any one trade at a given time. As long as there are new, legitimate trades that investors want to borrow crypto to put on, BlockFi will be able to generate enough yield to pay out above-market interest on deposits. The question is: can it expand from that wedge into the full suite of financial institution services faster than competitors can get comfortable with crypto? A smooth and familiar interface, crypto-backed loans, and legit high interest rates have propelled BlockFi to dizzying heights in less than four years: $50 million in monthly revenue with $15 billion in deposits and a $3 billion valuation. According to The Block, BlockFi was already profitable entering 2021. But this is just the early stage of BlockFixe2x80x99s master plan to reimagine what a modern financial institution looks like on crypto rails. In its report, BlockFi Company Intelligence, The Block wrote: From one perspective, BlockFi can be viewed as one of the world's largest crypto-native neobanks: part non-bank crypto-secured (collateral) lender, part digital asset depository institution. But even that framing provides an incomplete picture.What BlockFi is building, according to its CEO Zac Prince, is a lot like a crypto-native SoFi plus the prime brokerage desk of a large bank like JP Morgan. SoFi started with student loans as its wedge into a young, underserved customer base, and has expanded what it can offer those customers. Today, in addition to student loans, SoFi offers cash management, a credit card, stock and crypto trading, personal loans, home loans, auto loan refinancing, credit tracking, and life insurance. SoFi, which invested in BlockFixe2x80x99s seed round, recently announced a merger with one of Chamath Palihapityaxe2x80x99s SPACs (IPOE). Itxe2x80x99s currently trading around a $13 billion market cap. Similarly, BlockFi started with crypto loans as its wedge to attract a wave of newly wealthy crypto investors who were underserved by the market to make deposits. Theyxe2x80x99ve added no-fee trading and a credit card, and will continue to roll out new product lines. Itxe2x80x99s not hard to imagine cash management, stock trading, wealth management, mortgages, and all of the financial services that crypto holders might need, all built on crypto rails. Now, itxe2x80x99s trying to expand its addressable market by building more on-ramps that make it easy for crypto curious people to get involved in the space. An 8.6% APY is one way to pique peoplesxe2x80x99 interest, but credit cards and other products that let people easily earn and grow their crypto holdings without feeling like theyxe2x80x99re dealing with crypto will unlock new client bases. But the race is on. As a public company with an $86 billion market cap, Coinbase is undoubtedly going to expand its offering to try to infiltrate more of its customersxe2x80x99 financial lives. It already launched bitcoin-backed loans last August. DeFi is still confusing and hard to use, but itxe2x80x99s improving rapidly and attracting more people beyond the hardcore crypto community. Projects like Aave, Compound, Luna offer lower fees and more decentralization than BlockFi. Non-crypto companies like Square, Fidelity, Monzo, Robinhood, Mastercard, PayPal/Venmo, and even SoFi are moving into BlockFixe2x80x99s space: Square said 1 million customers bought Bitcoin in January, and it holds over 3,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet Robinhood said that 9.5 million people traded crypto on its app in Q1 PayPal lets customers buy, sell, and hold cryptoPayPalxe2x80x99s Venmo will let people pay each other in cryptoMastercard is supporting crypto on its network Visa built a crypto API that itxe2x80x99s piloting with neobanks. The list goes on, and new runners are entering the race every day. Many of these companies have more robust financial services offerings than BlockFi, and are betting that adding crypto into the mix is enough to retain existing users and attract some new ones. BlockFixe2x80x99s bet is that crypto, or at least digital currency, is just better than the existing financial system in a lot of ways that have nothing to do with decentralization, and that CeFi, which combines the benefits of centralization and digital money, is the winning combo. Software is eating the world, and at some point, they think crypto will eat the way we store and exchange money by building money directly into the infrastructure itself. If that turns out to be wrong, or in a more extreme case, if bitcoin crashes and BlockFixe2x80x99s clients and counterparties explode, BlockFi could struggle, and therexe2x80x99s no FDIC to back up its deposits.But if thatxe2x80x99s true, if crypto is fundamental to building better financial products, then BlockFixe2x80x99s wedge and singular focus on crypto will be an advantage versus incumbents and startups that try to add it on after the fact. Robinhood, for example, doesnxe2x80x99t even let users transfer crypto outside of the app. If people accept that money moves more easily and equitably on crypto rails, bolt-on solutions built for speculation wonxe2x80x99t cut it. If theyxe2x80x99re right, and CeFi wins, the battle may end up being BlockFi vs. Coinbase. BlockFi board member Anthony xe2x80x9cPompxe2x80x9d Pompliano believes that BlockFixe2x80x99s decision to start with deposits gives it a clearer path to product expansion, drawing on Robinhood vs. Square: Robinhood remains a brokerage-focused business. They have tried to scale by adding new products (crypto trading, cash accounts, etc), but that appears to be a much more difficult road than originally anticipated. Square on the other hand has been able to build a serious ecosystem of products that includes payment infrastructure, point-of-sale technology, CashApp, Bitcoin brokerage, and fractional share brokerage for public equities.The not-so-subtle implication is that Coinbase is Robinhood and BlockFi is Square, and that BlockFi can build Coinbase before Coinbase can build BlockFi. Coinbasexe2x80x99s IPO just adds fuel to the fire. More companies will enter the space. Spreads will get arbitraged away. Yields will compress. 8.6% APY wonxe2x80x99t last forever, but if BlockFi can build a robust suite of financial services with crypto tools for an expanding base of crypto owners, it has a shot at building a lasting institution in a competitive and lucrative space. BlockFi is offering Not Boring readers up to $250 in free bitcoin for opening up and funding an account. I did it myself, and it was smooth and easy. That said, do your own diligence, read reviews. You probably shouldnxe2x80x99t put all of your money in BlockFi.

Your feedback helps me make this great.Loved | Great | Good | Meh | BadThanks for reading, and see you on Monday!PackyCouple of reasons why banks rates are low: 1. Front end rates are anchored by the fed funds rate which is 0.25-0.5% now. Deposits from retail clients are basically overnight unsecured lending to the bank which is why theyxe2x80x99re near 0%; 2) Liquidity trap from years of low interest rates. Borrowers are not borrowing not because they donxe2x80x99t want to but because they already are saddled with debt. Corp debt is high, consumer debt is high. There is just no more room to borrow more.Theoretically not free money.

How do you actually know that BlockFi has one USD in reserve for each stable coin they've created? Are they audited by someone reputable? Tether and Bitfinex are 100% a scam and banned in NY for that reason. Additionally, I'm not sure how big the bitcoin arbitrage trade is. CME bitcoin futures are cash settled and there is no physical delivery, which limits the trade - it is not a true arbitrage. Plus, I don't know of any reputable hedge funds or banks that trade crypto.

Coinbase IPOxe2x80x99d yesterday to wild success. After touching $420.69 and going as high as $429.54, it closed at $328.28, up 31% from its reference price of $250. It peaked at a market cap of over $100 billion, and closed at $86 billion. Ixe2x80x99m more excited about BlockFi, though, and not because theyxe2x80x99re sponsoring this post. Itxe2x80x99s a more selfish reason, one that makes the sponsorship money seem like peanuts. See, if BlockFi existed in 2013 instead of Coinbase, I probably wouldnxe2x80x99t even be writing this newsletter. On May 16, 2013, when Coinbase was less than a year old, I set up an account and bought my first bitcoin. I forget why, but I just looked up when Union Square Ventures first invested, and that must have been it: That was good enough for me. I bought 10 BTC on May 16th, another 15 on June 14th, and another 13 on July 12th. That September, after quitting my job in finance, I flew my unemployed ass to Oktoberfest for a fun weekend with a few friends. On September 24th, after ten too many steins, I woke up in my Munich hotel room a little hungover and feeling dumb for spending so much on the trip and the night out... and made the stupidest financial decision of my life. I just sold some of those silly bitcoin Ixe2x80x99d bought, and bingo, free Oktoberfest. It felt like such an obviously responsible thing to do that three days later, I sold ten more, then I sold eight in October, five in November, and the last five in May (for a nice little 4x, I might add!). I sold all 38 bitcoins for a total of $7,232. At current prices, those 38 bitcoins are worth $2,450,050. Gulp. If BlockFi had been around at the time, I could have taken out a USD loan against some of those bitcoin and earned interest on the rest while they sat safely in my account. If BlockFi paid interest on bitcoin that whole time, like they do today, Ixe2x80x99d have more than 40 bitcoin today, or over $2.6 million. Double gulp.  Ixe2x80x99ve told you before that Ixe2x80x99m an idiot, and I wasnxe2x80x99t kidding. But thatxe2x80x99s enough self-chastising for one day. Wexe2x80x99re here to talk about BlockFi.BlockFi, which just announced a $350 million Series D led by Bain Capital Ventures, Pomp Investments, Tiger Global, and partners of DST Global, is building a full-fledged financial institution for crypto investors. BlockFi offers four products to retail investors: BlockFi Interest Account (at rates up to 8.6% APY)Trading AccountsCrypto-Backed LoansCredit CardIt also acts as a prime broker for institutional clients, with custody, financing, execution, and margin. BlockFi is building SoFi plus JP Morganxe2x80x99s prime broker desk, for crypto. Therexe2x80x99s a race going on among everyone in the financial services space -- centralized crypto companies like BlockFi and Coinbase, neobanks like Chime and Monzo, public fintech companies like Square and PayPal/Venmo, and large brokerages and banks -- to become the financial super-app, the place that customers go for loans, credit cards, trading, insurance, cash management, and more. BlockFi has a unique wedge: a growing suite of products that earn clients high interest rates and free crypto.The first question anyone has when they hear about BlockFi is: xe2x80x9cWhatxe2x80x99s the catch? 8.6% APY sounds too good to be true. That canxe2x80x99t be legit.xe2x80x9d I went DEEP to understand how they do it, and itxe2x80x99s legit. Essentially, BlockFi arbitrages the fact that traditional finance and crypto donxe2x80x99t like to deal with each other. To understand how it works, wexe2x80x99re going back down the crypto rabbit hole. Wexe2x80x99ll cover topics like bitcoin, stablecoins, DeFi, and CeFi, and basis trades. Youxe2x80x99ve probably heard the terms, but probably, like me, didnxe2x80x99t fully understand what they mean. Wexe2x80x99ll change that. At the very least, wexe2x80x99ll all sound smarter at our next party.Therexe2x80x99s so much to dig into here that itxe2x80x99s hard to know where to start, but wexe2x80x99re going to try:What Does a Bank Do? What BlockFi DoesStablecoins and 8.6% APYGrayscale Bitcoin TrustThe Race to the Finance Super AppThe OfferAfter doing the research for this piece, I moved some of my money into stablecoins on BlockFi, and transferred all of my (much, much smaller than 2013) bitcoin holdings to BlockFi from Coinbase. Yesterday, I was on a YouTube livestream with Ben Carlson talking about the Coinbase IPO, and unprompted, he said that hexe2x80x99d done the same. If you want to check it out for yourself, sign up with the Not Boring link to get up to $250 in free bitcoin when you fund your account. Try BlockFiIf youxe2x80x99re still wondering what BlockFi is and how it pulls off such high rates, keep reading. Therexe2x80x99s a lot to learn. Letxe2x80x99s start somewhere obviousxe2x80xa6 Banks make money in three main ways: Net Interest Margin. Customers deposit money. Banks lend that money out to other people and businesses at a certain rate, pay depositors a lower rate, and keep the difference.Interchange. When you use a credit or debit card at a store, the store pays your bank and its bank, typically as a percentage of the transaction and a small fixed amount. Fees. Banks charge customers money when they overdraft, take money out of an ATM, and for all sorts of other things. For our purposes, Net Interest Margin is the most important. Itxe2x80x99s the spread between what banks pay on deposits and what they earn on loans. Letxe2x80x99s do the math on a mortgage as an example.Right now, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on a standard Bank of America bank account is 0.01%. Letxe2x80x99s assume they can lend money to a homebuyer on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 3.0%. Bank of Americaxe2x80x99s Net Interest Margin is 3% - 0.01% = 2.99%. Itxe2x80x99s not that banks want to pay next to nothing on deposits. Itxe2x80x99s just that with low rates across the board, banks arenxe2x80x99t able to pay much more and make enough net interest margin to pay for overhead and still generate enough profit to keep shareholders happy. When they could lend money at a higher rate (30-year mortgage rates were 18% in the early xe2x80x9880s), savings accounts paid higher rates too. Banks would love to pay high interest rates on deposits. Banks compete with all of the different things you can do with your money -- buy a house, stocks, or crypto, pay off loans, travel. The higher the interest rate, the more likely you are to keep your money sitting there. More money sitting there means the banks can lend more means higher income for the banks. Given the low rates they earn from borrowers, they just canxe2x80x99t.1BlockFi, however, can. Founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez in 2017, BlockFi is a crypto-native financial institution. But while BlockFi is for crypto investors, itxe2x80x99s not decentralized. It has over 700 employees, a headquarters in Jersey City, and is regulated. On the spectrum between a traditional financial institution (xe2x80x9cTradFixe2x80x9d) and a Decentralized Finance (xe2x80x9cDeFixe2x80x9d) protocol, it falls somewhere in the middle. Like Coinbase, itxe2x80x99s whatxe2x80x99s known as Centralized Finance (xe2x80x9cCeFixe2x80x9d).To a client, BlockFi looks and feels like an online bank. When I set up my account, it felt very much like setting up a regular online bank account. I signed up, verified my identity, and waited a day for everything to get approved. Once I was in, I connected to my bank account via Plaid and deposited money via ACH. The money hit my account instantly and BlockFi converted it to GUSD (a stablecoin). Without me doing anything special or crypto-y, itxe2x80x99s now earning 8.6% APY. With Flex, I chose what currency I get interest paid in. So I deposited in USD, converted automatically to stablecoin, and get 8.6% interest paid out in ETH. Then, I transferred my BTC from Coinbase. It took about two minutes, and now Ixe2x80x99m earning 6% APY on that, in bitcoin. (Rates vary by coin deposited)Within two days of starting the process, I now have a meaningful amount of my net worth in BlockFi. I wouldnxe2x80x99t recommend it if I didnxe2x80x99t trust it for myself. And it was easy. That familiar bank feeling with backend crypto superpowers is by design. Early BlockFi clients were crypto natives (they had to be to use a new crypto-based product during crypto winter), but the company is making a push to attract crypto-curious clients, kind of like us. They want to be the on-ramp for millions of people to get involved with crypto. A couple of interesting things happened in the setup process: It Felt Like a Regular Bank. BlockFixe2x80x99s on-ramp to crypto feels smooth and familiar. Crypto Superpowers. I transferred a good chunk of money from Coinbase to BlockFi in minutes, not the hours or days it would take to send a wire or transfer money between accounts. BlockFi thinks that instant settlement gives it a big advantage over traditional financial institutions. That combination of ease and power is working. In early March, BlockFi announced a $350 million Series D that valued the company at $3 billion. Traditional venture/hedge funds Bain Capital Ventures, Tiger Global, and DST Global joined crypto-focused Pomp Investments as co-leads. At the time of the announcement, the company announced some eye-popping stats:$50 million in monthly revenue, up from $1.5 million a year earlier$15 billion in assets on the platform, up from $1 billion a year earlier0% loss rate across its lending portfolio 50% month-over month growth $50 million per month is an absurd amount of money for a company thatxe2x80x99s less than four years old. It would be a great annual revenue number for a company that age. BlockFi generates revenue in three (soon to be four) ways: BlockFi Interest Account: Earn up to 8.6% APY on stablecoin deposits, 6% on BTC, and 5.25% on ETH.Trading Accounts: No fee trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrenciesCrypto-Backed Loans: Loans on crypto balances as low as 4.5% APY Credit Card: Visa credit card with 1.5% Bitcoin back on every purchase (coming soon)These look a lot like the ways that banks make money. Letxe2x80x99s break down each, saving the most complex for last. Trading AccountsBlockFi lets clients buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The product is similar to Coinbase in that itxe2x80x99s a centralized and easy-to-use way to buy crypto, but there are a couple key differences. Coinbase Offers More Currencies. Because Coinbasexe2x80x99s business is all about buying and selling crypto, it offers a lot more assets than BlockFi. You can buy nine assets on BlockFi, and 44 on Coinbase. While BlockFi will add more assets over time, itxe2x80x99s not the focus of the business. Trading on BlockFi is really about giving people a way to build up crypto deposits that BlockFi can lend out, and it only offers trading in coins that it lends. BlockFi Has Lower Fees. Coinbase makes most of its money by charging retail traders fees. Coinbase charges normal accounts 3-4% transaction fees per trade, plus a spread on top. That drops to 0.5% plus a spread for Coinbase Pro accounts. It nets out to a 1.25-1.5% take rate on retail trades. Institutions pay much less, around 0.05%.In Coinbase and the cryptoeconomy, Tanay Jaipuria wrote: Over 95% of the revenue that Coinbase generates comes from transaction revenue, i.e., commissions on trades from retail and institutional clients, so letxe2x80x99s focus on that. Digging one level further, Coinbasexe2x80x99s institutional trading volume makes up about 60% of total volume. However, Coinbase makes 95% of its transaction revenue (and 90% of its total revenue) from retail trading volume.BlockFi does not charge transaction fees, but it does take a spread on trades that averages at around 1%. Itxe2x80x99s cheaper than Coinbase, but more expensive than exchanges like Binance and FTX that are more powerful but harder to use, particularly for people new to crypto.Importantly, like Coinbase, FTX, Binance, Uniswap, and other exchanges, but unlike non-crypto platforms like Robinhood and PayPal, BlockFi lets you move your coins in and out. At this point, trading is a feature on BlockFi, not a full standalone product. Itxe2x80x99s a way to onboard people to crypto and get them earning yield. Bitcoin Rewards Credit CardBlockFi is launching a credit card, with Visa, that feels like a regular credit card in every way -- you can use it everywhere -- except that it gives you 1.5% back in Bitcoin whenever you use it, and up to $750 or more in bonus bitcoin rewards. This one is straightforward. Credit card providers earn an annual fee and interchange, and itxe2x80x99s up to them to use it in a way that attracts customers and strengthens the business. Traditionally, thatxe2x80x99s meant points, miles, or cash back. In Rampxe2x80x99s Double-Unicorn Rounds, I wrote that instead of points: ...it rewards them with better software. Better software drives more usage, which drives more revenue, which drives better software, and so on. The faster the flywheel turns, the further ahead Ramp pulls. The same principle is at play here. Instead of points or cash back, BlockFi gives people bitcoin. It seems like a minor distinction, but itxe2x80x99s potentially massive, for two reasons. One, theyxe2x80x99re rewards that can increase in value over time. If youxe2x80x99re bullish on bitcoin, then you believe the rewards you earn will be worth more in the future. Youxe2x80x99re getting long bitcoin every time you buy anything. (Of course, they can also go down over time). Two, bitcoin rewards are an on-ramp. There are a lot of people who donxe2x80x99t want to spend their hard-earned cash buying bitcoin, or feel uncomfortable depositing money in an account and trading it for bitcoin. Those same people might be happy to just get free Bitcoin for doing something theyxe2x80x99d be doing anyway. Once they do, it kicks off BlockFixe2x80x99s money flywheel: Earn bitcoinBitcoin automatically deposited in BlockFi account, BlockFi lends it outClient earns 6% on bitcoin holdings in bitcoin, building up the stackClient can take USD loans against that bitcoin The bitcoin credit card is an on-ramp, a way to get the next 15 million people to dip their toes in crypto. Itxe2x80x99s an on-ramp to BlockFi, too, and likely a low CAC one - who doesnxe2x80x99t want free bitcoin? Once theyxe2x80x99re in the ecosystem, BlockFi can monetize them in all sorts of ways as it builds out more financial institution functionality. Crypto-Backed LoansTherexe2x80x99s this tension in crypto: thousands of people have made millions of dollars by buying and hodling bitcoin, ETH, and other coins. On-chain, theyxe2x80x99re very wealthy. But to actually use that wealth to buy things, they need to sell coins. Thatxe2x80x99s a problem, because selling triggers capital gains taxes in the US, and because most crypto-wealthy believe bitcoin will only keep going up in value over time. Historically, doing anything but hodling has caused major regret.The internet is littered with cautionary tales. See: my ~$2.5 million Oktoberfest experience, or even more painfully, Bitcoin Pizza. On May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas from Papa Johnxe2x80x99s for 10,000 BTC. At the time, those 10,000 BTC were worth $41. Today, theyxe2x80x99d be worth $645 million.  The examples are painful and comical, but itxe2x80x99s a genuine problem: therexe2x80x99s nearly $1.2 trillion in wealth tied up in a currency that people donxe2x80x99t feel comfortable spending. BlockFi solves that by offering USD loans collateralized by bitcoin at rates as low as 4.5% APR. BlockFi is able to offer competitive rates while protecting its downside by holding onto your bitcoin (or ETH, Litecoin, or PAXG) as collateral. Loans start at a 50% Loan to Value (LTV), meaning that you need to put up bitcoin that are worth twice as much as youxe2x80x99re borrowing. If you want a $100k loan, you need to put up 3.12 BTC, currently worth $200k. If the price of bitcoin crashes, that gives BlockFi a 50% cushion. If the price drops below certain thresholds, it will ask borrowers to post more collateral. In the worst case scenario, it can liquidate some of your bitcoin to cover the loan. That said, even in the sharp drawdown in March 2020, it didnxe2x80x99t have to liquidate any clients, while DeFi protocols like Maker did. Thatxe2x80x99s good, because selling into a massive selloff is typically the worst thing you can do. This highlights an important and obvious distinction between DeFi and CeFi: CeFi companies have teams of real people who can proactively work with clients to get ahead of issues before getting to the point at which a liquidation needs to occur. Protocols have dashboards and warning signs, but not customer support and risk teams whose job it is to avoid catastrophe. Everything is a trade-off. DeFi protocols typically have lower fees and are more open and transparent. Many people believe in xe2x80x9cnot your keys, not your coins,xe2x80x9d the idea that if you keep your coins in a centralized account, you donxe2x80x99t really control them. (Balaji made this point in an excellent Tim Ferriss Show interview.) Plus, one personxe2x80x99s comfort in having people on the other side is anotherxe2x80x99s discomfort in having people on the other side. For BlockFixe2x80x99s target customers and institutional partners, though, the trade-off can be worth it. BlockFi has a 0% loss ratio on loans. Itxe2x80x99s the lower risk option. BlockFi Interest AccountUp to this point, everything feels pretty normal: no-fee trading, credit cards with 1.5% back, and collateralized loans at 4.5% APR are things wexe2x80x99re used to. BlockFi just does it all with crypto. The BlockFi Interest Account is normally where people start to give me quizzical looks, because BlockFi offers up to 8.6% APY on stablecoins and 6% APY on bitcoin. Thatxe2x80x99s an insanely high rate, and it makes a huge difference. Over 30 years, $100k at 8.6% APY turns into $1,188,214. At the standard 0.01% APY I earn at Bank of America, it turns into $100,300. Obviously, there is no free lunch, and there is especially no free lunch over thirty years. The biggest risk with BlockFi is that its accounts are not FDIC insured. If BlockFi gets totally wiped out, your money is gone. Therexe2x80x99s a trade-off: for accepting more risk, you earn higher interest. BlockFi takes that risk very seriously. Watch this video with the companyxe2x80x99s Chief Risk Officer Rene van Kesteren, a former Managing Director in Equity Structured Finance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to understand how they think about it. Stillxe2x80xa6 8.6% is a lot. It beggars belief. I didnxe2x80x99t understand it at all, which is why I wanted to write this piece in the first place, to dive in and see if I could figure it out and explain it. Here goes. Remember from earlier that banks want to pay high interest rates. It attracts deposits, which enable more lending, which makes more money. A lot of challenger banks will even pay unsustainably high rates on deposits as a customer acquisition cost (CAC) in the form of a bonus rate on top. Those are typically limited to some period of time, like the first six months, after which you go back to earning normal APY. BlockFi is not a bank (technically, itxe2x80x99s a secured non-bank lender), but it makes money like one. Itxe2x80x99s able to offer 8.6% APY on stablecoin deposits and 6% on BTC not as an introductory offer, but because it is able to make a lot more than that on its loans. According to crypto research and media firm The Block, BlockFi was running a 10% average weighted APR on its retail loans in early 2021. That leaves plenty of room for 8.6% APY on stablecoins, especially when blended with lower rates on other assets. These rates are not directly tied to crypto prices; most of BlockFixe2x80x99s life has been during a bear market. Theyxe2x80x99re based on the availability of arbitrages. Hedge funds can generate high, nearly-riskless returns on certain trades if they can get leverage, and banks wonxe2x80x99t make the loans, so funds are happy to pay BlockFi rates that make 8.6% APY accounts possible. The main arbitrage is something called a basis trade.A basis trade is the purchase of an underlying asset and the sale of a related derivative, like a future. You make money on a basis trade as the price of the underlying asset and the derivative converge. In this case, bitcoin futures, which trade on traditional commodities exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or smaller futures exchanges like Deribit, trade at a significant premium to the xe2x80x9cspotxe2x80x9d price of bitcoin, which is the price that youxe2x80x99d pay if you went into the market right now and bought bitcoin. When a commodityxe2x80x99s futures price is higher than the spot price, itxe2x80x99s called contango. Typically, contango occurs when investors believe the price of something will be worth more in the future than it is today. In the oil markets, for example, that could happen if people expect a very cold winter in a few months, and want to lock in a price. With normal commodities like oil, youxe2x80x99re OK paying a premium on the futures because owning the futures means you donxe2x80x99t have to take delivery of actual barrels of oil and store them somewhere until the winter. Bitcoin, of course, costs practically nothing to hold, and yet, at the time of writing, June BTC futures are trading at a 46.4% premium to spot on Deribit.A hedge fund can buy bitcoins today at $63k and sell an equal amount of futures contracts for $67.5k, sit there while time passes, and collect the difference. Bloombergxe2x80x99s Joe Weisenthal gives the example of December futures trading on the CME at $63,000 last Friday while Bitcoin was at $58,300. In either case, the ~45% annualized return comes from rolling 3m futures four times per year.Weisenthal wrote, xe2x80x9cWhat this means is in theory (I stress, *in theory*) you could go long spot bitcoin, while shorting the December future, and if you just wait for the two to converge, thatxe2x80x99s an easy 8% in 12 months.xe2x80x9d (Note: I think he meant an easy 8% in eight months). That is (again, in theory) free money, a riskless trade2. Hedge funds love finding riskless trades. They can borrow tons of money, xe2x80x9clever up,xe2x80x9d and make way more than 8%. And the 8% number is relatively low. JP Morgan rate derivatives strategist Josh Younger put out a report last Friday saying that the xe2x80x9cJune CME contract was offering a 25% annualized yield relative to spot.xe2x80x9d Normally, when therexe2x80x99s nearly free money lying around, it doesnxe2x80x99t stick around for too long. It gets xe2x80x9carbitraged away.xe2x80x9d In this case, that would mean enough people borrow money to buy bitcoin, and enough people sell the futures contract, that the spread between the two compresses to next to nothing. But in this case, thatxe2x80x99s not really happening, for a couple reasons: What Institutions Can Buy. Some big, traditional financial institutions canxe2x80x99t really go to Binance or even Coinbase to buy large amounts of bitcoin, but theyxe2x80x99re very used to buying commodities futures on the CME, so they buy up futures, bidding up the price.Who Lends Money for Crypto Trades. Arbitrageurs want to borrow to lever up on the trade in a big way, but banks donxe2x80x99t like to lend money for crypto trades. Thatxe2x80x99s BlockFixe2x80x99s opportunity. As Matthew Leising wrote in Bloomberg: Some of the largest non-bank firms in cryptocurrency including BitGo, BlockFi, Galaxy Digital and Genesis are stepping up to meet investor demand for dollars amid a long-standing weariness by banks to lend to individuals or companies associated with Bitcoin and other digital assets. In this case, theyxe2x80x99re lending to hedge funds that need cash to buy Bitcoin for a trade that is almost guaranteed to pay out at annualized returns that have recently hit 20% to 40%.Banks wonxe2x80x99t lend to hedge funds on a free money trade because it stinks of crypto, and neither they nor their shareholders want anything to do with crypto (for now). BlockFi, which is crypto-native and understands the market as well as anyone, is more comfortable with the risk and is very willing to lend hedge funds the money for the basis trade at the right price.Banks wonxe2x80x99t lend to BlockFi to turn around and lend to hedge funds to make the basis trade, so where does BlockFi get the money to lend? You guessed it. Deposits. Specifically, stablecoin deposits.Wait, what are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that peg their value to some external reference, often USD. They allow funds to dollar denominate trades on the blockchain.  The best explanation Ixe2x80x99ve come across is that stablecoins are just tokenized dollars. In the case of one of the most popular, USD Coin, xe2x80x9ctokenizing USD into USDC is a three-step process:1) A user sends USD to the token issuer's bank account.2) The issuer uses USDC smart contract to create an equivalent amount of USDC.3) The newly minted USDC are delivered to the user, while the substituted US dollars are held in reserve.xe2x80x9dStablecoins are regular dollars that are compatible with the blockchain, and are typically backed by actual dollars in an account. Theyxe2x80x99re important here because hedge funds need them to make sure the basis trade is actually delta neutral. If the trade is dollar-denominated, meaning prices are all quoted in dollars, theyxe2x80x99re not taking currency risk, or a directional bet on where bitcoin ends up. Thatxe2x80x99s why BlockFi is able to pay 8.6% on stablecoin deposits. (They automatically turn your USD into stablecoins when you deposit money via ACH). BlockFi lends out stablecoin deposits to hedge funds to lever up on the basis trade. If hedge funds are able to pay BlockFi 15% because theyxe2x80x99re making 40%, BlockFi can afford to pay depositors 8.6%. This trade wonxe2x80x99t last forever, and the 8.6% rate will likely come down in the long run, although itxe2x80x99s been stable at 8.6% for many months. A few things may happen to tweak the trade in the short-term:Demand for bitcoin and bitcoin futures may decline. There is historically high bitcoin demand right now, and if that decreases, there will be less premium on the futures, which means less juice to be arbed.Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs are coming -- there are three in Canada already. That will have opposing impacts on the trade. On the one hand, it will make it easier to run the trade, which would mean more demand for dollar-denominated loans. On the other, it will decrease the demand for futures, which may tighten the spread and make the trade less profitable. It will be interesting to watch where that nets out. More Lenders Come Into the Space. Over time, assuming crypto keeps getting bigger and more legitimized, new startups, existing competitors, decentralized protocols, and big banks will all compete to lend money against crypto trades. In a low-rate environment, companies donxe2x80x99t just let other companies take all of the juicy yield for themselves. As the supply of dollars available to run the arb increases, rates come down.That said, even if the basis trade goes away, BlockFi is still able to earn more than 8.6% by lending out dollars for crypto-backed loans, and therexe2x80x99s still a massive gap between what people want to borrow to buy crypto and what theyxe2x80x99re able to borrow: Rachel @tolstoybbApril 8th 2021It will take some time for the basis trade to get arbitraged away, and crypto is still the wild west. New opportunities are popping up all of the time that a crypto-native financial institution like BlockFi is better equipped to understand and move quickly on than traditional ones. Even today, the basis trade is just one of the things BlockFi does in order to pay out seemingly-too-good-to-be-true rates. The rates arenxe2x80x99t based on any one specific trade, but on BlockFixe2x80x99s ability to accumulate and lend crypto assets for which therexe2x80x99s more demand than supply. Stablecoins are the most in-demand because theyxe2x80x99re needed to dollar denominate all sorts of trades, but BlockFi offers competitive rates on 10 crypto-assets. Rates are based on how much BlockFi can generate by lending each type of asset out, which is based on supply and demand. Putting one BTC or ETH in if you have them pays out 6%, but it tiers down to a more standard 0.5% from there as you deposit more because there isnxe2x80x99t as much demand to borrow bitcoin or ETH. While stablecoin rates have remained consistent, bitcoin APYxe2x80x99s on BlockFi have come down recently as the most profitable trade -- Grayscale -- went away. There are all sorts of reasons someone might want to borrow bitcoin, including shorting (although therexe2x80x99s not much demand for that today outside of hedging), but the biggest was to arb the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium to NAV. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is one of the few indirect ways (i.e. not owning bitcoin) for people to get bitcoin exposure. It holds bitcoin in a trust, and then sells shares in the trust in the stock market. Like futures, GBTC traded at a premium to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of bitcoin it held because people could buy it more easily, in ways that they were used to, than bitcoin itself. I can buy shares of GBTC in my Schwab account or 401k. To many, that feels safer, and it comes with tax advantages. (AltoIRA lets you own crypto in your IRA directly, FYI.) As a result, GBTC has traded in a 5% - 30% premium to NAV range over the past couple of years.Institutions took advantage of that premium. The way GBTC works is that people and institutions can put Bitcoin in the Trust, keep it there for six months, and then get GBTC shares which they could turn around and sell to retail buyers at that 5-30% premium. Same story: nearly riskeless trade, borrow bitcoin to exploit it, profit. 5-30% premium in six months meant 10-60% annualized returns, boosted by margin. In order to borrow bitcoin, they turned to BlockFi. BlockFi generated strong yield from the trade, which they gave to depositors in the form of high yields on bitcoin. Over the past couple of months, though, the GBTC premium turned into a discount as buyers got new ways to get bitcoin exposure indirectly: like Tesla and Square, which hold BTC on the balance sheet, Microstrategy, which holds so much bitcoin on its balance sheet itxe2x80x99s essentially a BTC ETF, and three Canadian Bitcoin ETFs, launched in the past couple months, already have $1.3 billion in assets under management. BlockFi itself launched its own Bitcoin Trust. More supply for the same indirect bitcoin demand meant lower GBTC prices. With no premium, and a discount in its place, the demand to borrow bitcoin to put in the trust went away. As a result, BlockFi lowered its bitcoin APY. The Grayscale illustrates two things: that BlockFixe2x80x99s rates may come down over time, but also that it has a diversified enough business that itxe2x80x99s not reliant on any one trade at a given time. As long as there are new, legitimate trades that investors want to borrow crypto to put on, BlockFi will be able to generate enough yield to pay out above-market interest on deposits. The question is: can it expand from that wedge into the full suite of financial institution services faster than competitors can get comfortable with crypto? A smooth and familiar interface, crypto-backed loans, and legit high interest rates have propelled BlockFi to dizzying heights in less than four years: $50 million in monthly revenue with $15 billion in deposits and a $3 billion valuation. According to The Block, BlockFi was already profitable entering 2021. But this is just the early stage of BlockFixe2x80x99s master plan to reimagine what a modern financial institution looks like on crypto rails. In its report, BlockFi Company Intelligence, The Block wrote: From one perspective, BlockFi can be viewed as one of the world's largest crypto-native neobanks: part non-bank crypto-secured (collateral) lender, part digital asset depository institution. But even that framing provides an incomplete picture.What BlockFi is building, according to its CEO Zac Prince, is a lot like a crypto-native SoFi plus the prime brokerage desk of a large bank like JP Morgan. SoFi started with student loans as its wedge into a young, underserved customer base, and has expanded what it can offer those customers. Today, in addition to student loans, SoFi offers cash management, a credit card, stock and crypto trading, personal loans, home loans, auto loan refinancing, credit tracking, and life insurance. SoFi, which invested in BlockFixe2x80x99s seed round, recently announced a merger with one of Chamath Palihapityaxe2x80x99s SPACs (IPOE). Itxe2x80x99s currently trading around a $13 billion market cap. Similarly, BlockFi started with crypto loans as its wedge to attract a wave of newly wealthy crypto investors who were underserved by the market to make deposits. Theyxe2x80x99ve added no-fee trading and a credit card, and will continue to roll out new product lines. Itxe2x80x99s not hard to imagine cash management, stock trading, wealth management, mortgages, and all of the financial services that crypto holders might need, all built on crypto rails. Now, itxe2x80x99s trying to expand its addressable market by building more on-ramps that make it easy for crypto curious people to get involved in the space. An 8.6% APY is one way to pique peoplesxe2x80x99 interest, but credit cards and other products that let people easily earn and grow their crypto holdings without feeling like theyxe2x80x99re dealing with crypto will unlock new client bases. But the race is on. As a public company with an $86 billion market cap, Coinbase is undoubtedly going to expand its offering to try to infiltrate more of its customersxe2x80x99 financial lives. It already launched bitcoin-backed loans last August. DeFi is still confusing and hard to use, but itxe2x80x99s improving rapidly and attracting more people beyond the hardcore crypto community. Projects like Aave and Compound offer lower fees and more decentralization than BlockFi. Non-crypto companies like Square, Fidelity, Monzo, Robinhood, Mastercard, PayPal/Venmo, and even SoFi are moving into BlockFixe2x80x99s space: Square said 1 million customers bought Bitcoin in January, and it holds over 3,000 bitcoin on its balance sheet Robinhood said that 9.5 million people traded crypto on its app in Q1 PayPal lets customers buy, sell, and hold cryptoPayPalxe2x80x99s Venmo will let people pay each other in cryptoMastercard is supporting crypto on its network Visa built a crypto API that itxe2x80x99s piloting with neobanks. The list goes on, and new runners are entering the race every day. Many of these companies have more robust financial services offerings than BlockFi, and are betting that adding crypto into the mix is enough to retain existing users and attract some new ones. BlockFixe2x80x99s bet is that crypto, or at least digital currency, is just better than the existing financial system in a lot of ways that have nothing to do with decentralization, and that CeFi, which combines the benefits of centralization and digital money, is the winning combo. Software is eating the world, and at some point, they think crypto will eat the way we store and exchange money by building money directly into the infrastructure itself. If that turns out to be wrong, or in a more extreme case, if bitcoin crashes and BlockFixe2x80x99s clients and counterparties explode, BlockFi could struggle, and therexe2x80x99s no FDIC to back up its deposits.But if thatxe2x80x99s true, if crypto is fundamental to building better financial products, then BlockFixe2x80x99s wedge and singular focus on crypto will be an advantage versus incumbents and startups that try to add it on after the fact. Robinhood, for example, doesnxe2x80x99t even let users transfer crypto outside of the app. If people accept that money moves more easily and equitably on crypto rails, bolt-on solutions built for speculation wonxe2x80x99t cut it. If theyxe2x80x99re right, and CeFi wins, the battle may end up being BlockFi vs. Coinbase. BlockFi board member Anthony xe2x80x9cPompxe2x80x9d Pompliano believes that BlockFixe2x80x99s decision to start with deposits gives it a clearer path to product expansion, drawing on Robinhood vs. Square: Robinhood remains a brokerage-focused business. They have tried to scale by adding new products (crypto trading, cash accounts, etc), but that appears to be a much more difficult road than originally anticipated. Square on the other hand has been able to build a serious ecosystem of products that includes payment infrastructure, point-of-sale technology, CashApp, Bitcoin brokerage, and fractional share brokerage for public equities.The not-so-subtle implication is that Coinbase is Robinhood and BlockFi is Square, and that BlockFi can build Coinbase before Coinbase can build BlockFi. Coinbasexe2x80x99s IPO just adds fuel to the fire. More companies will enter the space. Spreads will get arbitraged away. Yields will compress. 8.6% APY wonxe2x80x99t last forever, but if BlockFi can build a robust suite of financial services with crypto tools for an expanding base of crypto owners, it has a shot at building a lasting institution in a competitive and lucrative space. BlockFi is offering Not Boring readers up to $250 in free bitcoin for opening up and funding an account. I did it myself, and it was smooth and easy. That said, do your own diligence, read reviews. You probably shouldnxe2x80x99t put all of your money in BlockFi. I put less than 10%. If you own crypto and want to earn on or borrow against your holdings, or if youxe2x80x99re just curious and want the easiest on-ramp to earning and growing your crypto holdings, check it out:Sign Up for BlockFiCouple of reasons why banks rates are low: 1. Front end rates are anchored by the fed funds rate which is 0.25-0.5% now. Deposits from retail clients are basically overnight unsecured lending to the bank which is why theyxe2x80x99re near 0%; 2) Liquidity trap from years of low interest rates. Borrowers are not borrowing not because they donxe2x80x99t want to but because they already are saddled with debt. Corp debt is high, consumer debt is high. There is just no more room to borrow more.Theoretically not free money. You could lose money on a long spot vs short 3m futures trade if the contango steepens, which tends to happen in a bull market. \"Delta neutral\" is more accurate.

I wrote a lot of words about Not Boringxe2x80x99s first year and Rampxe2x80x99s double-unicorn rounds. Today, to give your brain a breather and mix things up, letxe2x80x99s a couple new things: Keeping the essay shorter. Auctioning off an NFT. Ixe2x80x99m convinced that if youxe2x80x99re the kind of person who reads Not Boring -- someone whoxe2x80x99s interested in the intersection of tech and business -- you should spend some time down the Web3 rabbit hole. Therexe2x80x99s too much interesting stuff happening and too many smart people involved to ignore it. The NFT is one way to get involved, and there are many more. Letxe2x80x99s get to it.Chris Dixon wrote two posts circa a decade ago that I come back to often: The next big thing will start out looking like a toy (2010)What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years (2013)Each is about one simple, actionable idea:Toy: Donxe2x80x99t dismiss new ideas off-hand, or you might miss the next big thing.Weekend: Watch what smart people do in their free time and get involved. Both widen your aperture. I keep coming back to these posts for the same reason that I read sci-fi: they prepare you to meet crazy new ideas with curiosity rather than dismissal. Theyxe2x80x99re both very short, too - 560 and 171 words, respectively. Ixe2x80x99m pretty sure Ixe2x80x99ve written sentences longer than each. Today, Ixe2x80x99m going to try a Chris Dixon-like approach to this essay, both in terms of form and content. And Ixe2x80x99m adding a twist.  Ixe2x80x99m minting a Not Boring essay as an NFT, auctioning it off (starting now), and splitting the proceeds with the people whose work I referenced.Chris Dixonxe2x80x99s work has had a big impact on mine. So has the work of many others. Every time I write a Not Boring essay, I link to the work of at least twenty other creators. Therexe2x80x99s no Not Boring without them. Linking to their work is a kind of payment in the form of attention. Thatxe2x80x99s typically how itxe2x80x99s worked, in both media and academic research: you write something, someone else uses it, they send you attention, and itxe2x80x99s up to you to figure out how to monetize it. But NFTs offer a way to tighten the value exchange.In Power to the Person, I wrote about research as a potential application of NFTs:Research. Today, the success of a research paper is measured by the number and quality of citations. What if, instead, the research paper was backed by an NFT that made it free to use for other academic research, but that paid the researcher out any time it was used for commercial purposes. The same should be true for media. Today, working with Jess Sloss at Seed Club and Patrick Rivera and the team at Mirror, wexe2x80x99re taking the first step towards making that possible:We minted my Power to the Person essay as an NFT and are auctioning it off, starting now.Bid on Power to the PersonThe Twist: in Power to the Person, I referenced 26 peoplexe2x80x99s work or ideas. I shouldnxe2x80x99t get all the credit, or all the proceeds from the NFT auction. And Ixe2x80x99m not. Mirror just created a feature that lets creators split the proceeds from the sale with other people, and Ixe2x80x99m the guinea pig, the first person to try it. The proceeds from the sale will be split with the 26 people whose work I referenced and the people who share it (if I have their ETH address; the unclaimed amounts will go to charity).Herexe2x80x99s how it works: 50% of the proceeds go to me, 50% goes to the people whose work I referenced, proportionate to my estimate of how big an impact each personxe2x80x99s work had on the essay. Li Jin will take home the most, with 8%, because her writing on the Passion Economy was fundamental to the piece.  You can bid on the essay now, and if you win, you own it. You can: Keep it forever Flip it in a few daysOr hold on to it as an investment in the hopes that either Not Boring makes it big or the concept of creator splits makes it big and you own the first ever NFT of its kind, in which case its value could increase. Ixe2x80x99m fascinated by why people buy certain NFTs, so Ixe2x80x99ll also record a conversation with the winning bidder and publish the podcast. To play, you just need to hit the link below, connect your wallet (I use Metamask), and bid: Bid on the First Not Boring NFTYouxe2x80x99re buying the essay, but really, youxe2x80x99re supporting the concept of splitting revenue equitably with everyone who impacts a piece of work. This is the first experiment in that direction, and you can own it.Donxe2x80x99t want to bid but want to support the idea and get involved? I wasnxe2x80x99t able to get everyonexe2x80x99s ETH address, which means that 69% of the split goes to me (nice!). Ixe2x80x99m donating 9% to charity, and for the remaining 10%xe2x80xa6 If you quote tweet this tweet below and include your ETH address, youxe2x80x99ll split 5% of the proceeds with everyone else who quote tweets it. Plus, wexe2x80x99ll randomly select one person who quote tweets it to get 5% of the proceeds. April 12th 2021The people who share creatorsxe2x80x99 work are a valuable piece of the work itself. All of you are the reason Ixe2x80x99m not just writing into the abyss. You should participate in the upside, too! Why am I doing this? Therexe2x80x99s a direct reason, and a meta reason. Letxe2x80x99s start with the direct. This experiment is a very rough first draft of what I think media could look like in the future. Already, people like Mario Gabriele are experimenting with splitting proceeds with intentional collaborators, people who decided to work on something together. Mario launched a $GENERALIST token and split the proceeds with people who worked on the S-1 Club piece on Coinbase. Aligning collaborator incentives is going to unlock new ways to work together.This is a little different. Power to the Person is about individuals creating increasingly complex businesses by building on the work of others. This NFT split is an attempt to compensate the xe2x80x9cothers.xe2x80x9d Most people who xe2x80x9ccollaboratexe2x80x9d on a piece donxe2x80x99t do it intentionally or synchronously. They are intentional creators of their own piece, and unwitting collaborators on future ones. This unwitting collaboration plays out over weeks, months, years, or decades. Someone contributes some idea to the universe for its own sake in the present, and then in the future, someone else picks that idea up, riffs on it, and creates something new by combining that existing idea with other existing ideas and some personal sauce. Sometimes the intentional creator gets credit for that original idea, in the form of a link, a shoutout, or an MLA citation. Often, people just steal the good ideas, blend them into their own work, and pass the whole melange off as their own. This isnxe2x80x99t malicious. Itxe2x80x99s how the brain works.But what if you could tag those original ideas? Nothing heavy. Not a paywall. Just a light tag that sticks to the idea as it flows through time, brains, and new works. When that idea is used to form a new idea, and that new idea makes money, the original creator gets a little tip for their contribution. Over time, if you put enough good, novel ideas into the universe, you might generate a stream of revenue that can support the creation of even more ideas. That revenue stream isnxe2x80x99t subscription or advertising. It doesnxe2x80x99t depend on you creating new work to make a living. Instead, it depends on the power of your ideas. On whether they become building blocks for new ideas. That changes the game. It changes how people create and what they create, and how they earn a living.Instead of writing something pretty good every week, writers can spend months honing one idea. Instead of being rewarded for audience size, creators are rewarded for idea impact. Instead of being rewarded for grabbing attention today, creators are rewarded for staying power over time.Instead of being paid as labor - write, make money; stop writing, stop making money - ideas become capital, making money for their owners even while their owners sleep.   This isnxe2x80x99t an either / or. The existence of ideas as equity doesnxe2x80x99t replace subscriptions or ad-supported models. Itxe2x80x99s just another option, a way for creators whose work doesnxe2x80x99t fit the current model to get in the game and earn a living, and a way for existing creators to diversify income streams content types. It rewards quality over quantity or virality. And itxe2x80x99s logistically possible because of Web3.This isnxe2x80x99t that, yet. The NFT is the xe2x80x9clooks like a toyxe2x80x9d version of that future. It relies on the remixer to want to pay out the remixed. Itxe2x80x99s still pretty manual. A lot of other things need to happen to get to the end-state I described above. This is just an experiment. But thatxe2x80x99s the meta-reason Ixe2x80x99m doing this: to experiment with Web3, and to encourage you to do the same. Itxe2x80x99s not as hard or complicated as it looks from the outside, and the potential benefits of being early are massive. Web3, aka crypto, is a return to the vision of the early internet, with built-in superpowers. Done right, it puts the value in the hands of the people who create the value. And if youxe2x80x99re reading this, itxe2x80x99s time to get involved. Web3 today sits at the intersection of Dixonxe2x80x99s two essays -- it looks like a toy, and a whole lot of smart people are spending their nights and weekends on it. The real ones are spending that time less for the short-term returns, and more because itxe2x80x99s really fucking fun. Itxe2x80x99s a nerd olympics. There are endless rabbit holes for the curious to explore, and countless willing tour guides. Itxe2x80x99s welcoming, collaborative, and fast.After I wrote Power to the Person, Jess Sloss, the founder of Seed Club, DMxe2x80x99ed me on Twitter. He wanted to help me get more involved with Web3, to experiment in addition to writing. We set up a call for early March, and he asked me, xe2x80x9cWhatxe2x80x99s an experiment youxe2x80x99d want to try?xe2x80x9d I thought for a second, and came up with the rough outline for the Split NFT above. It hadnxe2x80x99t been done before, but he thought hard for a couple minutes, and didnxe2x80x99t see any reason that it couldnxe2x80x99tbe done. He told me hexe2x80x99d talk to some people and get back to me. A week or so later, he brought Patrick Rivera from Mirror into the conversation. He said they couldnxe2x80x99t do it yet, but that theyxe2x80x99d work on it. Three weeks later, itxe2x80x99s live. In about a month, we went from crazy idea to live product. Thatxe2x80x99s lightning speed. Speed is possible because building on-chain is like open source with money baked in. Builders are able to take products off the shelf, write a few lines of code, and combine them into new products.For this particular experiment, Mirror took smart contracts for NFT Minting + Auctions + Splits off the shelf, added their own flavor, and voila. It really is like Legos. And itxe2x80x99s addictive. Once you start thinking about the possibilities, you canxe2x80x99t stop. Many of the smartest people I know have caught the bug. Itxe2x80x99s coming up in more and more conversations that I have. High-priced auctions are grabbing the headlines, but the people I talk to, non-crypto people, people with traditional backgrounds, are digging into the details and playing around.In the past two weeks alone:An investor told me that hexe2x80x99d spent hours learning about the mechanics of quadratic voting and needed to figure out how to balance Web3 exploration with his full-time job. Web3 is pulling more and more of his time.  Dror, who has spent most of his career in real estate, has been writing about the implications of NFTs and Social Tokens for work and employment. A successful entrepreneur whoxe2x80x99s been in tech since the beginning of the web is spending a lot of his brainspace on how to use DAOs to supercharge his community. James Wang, formerly a SaaS analyst at ARK, has been publicly transitioning from SaaS and traditional finance to crypto. He just tweeted his crypto meta-lessons: crypto is picking up mainstream adoption. Get involved early. And keep learning even if prices crash. The examples go on, but I said Ixe2x80x99d keep this short.Web3 is accumulating energy. Itxe2x80x99s built to accumulate energy. From a strategic perspective, this is its number one advantage: Web3 projects can build incredibly strong network effects very rapidly by structurally baking in rewards for early adopters. If anything disrupts the huge incumbent tech companies, Ixe2x80x99m increasingly convinced it will be built on the blockchain. I missed the beginning of the internet. I mostly missed the beginning of the mobile boom. Web3 feels like it is going to be equally important, and itxe2x80x99s still early days. I donxe2x80x99t want to miss this one.Spending time learning about and playing with Web3 has asymmetric upside. Itxe2x80x99s like playing around in the early days of the internet, except that you get rewarded for just playing. You donxe2x80x99t need to build the next big thing. Participating in the right community, buying the right NFT or social token, or backing the right protocol early brings intellectual and financial rewards. If youxe2x80x99re reading this, youxe2x80x99re still among the early ones. Maybe you own some Bitcoin, maybe you own some ETH. Go deeper. Pick something that youxe2x80x99re interested in. If youxe2x80x99re in finance, learn about DeFi. If youxe2x80x99re a community builder, learn about DAOs and social tokens. If youxe2x80x99re just broadly curious, pick any rabbit hole, jump in, and get involved.On a panel at Seed Clubxe2x80x99s Crypto x Creator Summit earlier this month, Li Jin talked about the reason she minted her own NFT, which sold for $25,000 and landed her in the New York Times. She said she didnxe2x80x99t want to write about or invest in the space without doing it herself. She wanted to understand the mechanics, and what itxe2x80x99s like to sell your own work to someone else. She wanted to experiment.Thatxe2x80x99s the point of this post: experiment. Get your hands a little dirty. Itxe2x80x99s not a normal Not Boring essay. Ixe2x80x99m not breaking down how something works. Ixe2x80x99m telling you that therexe2x80x99s something real happening, and ringing the bell for you to get involved.The Not Boring family is in exactly the right spot to help all of this cross the chasm. Wexe2x80x99re in the early adopter segment -- most of us have traditional business, finance, and tech backgrounds but are curious enough to learn and try new things -- and by getting involved and experimenting, we can help bring it mainstream. The cool thing about Web3 is that you can benefit directly from making that happen. Even if youxe2x80x99re not going to sell an NFT for $25k (most people probably wonxe2x80x99t, including me), find something to go out and play with and see where it leads. Start with an on-ramp like Coinbase or BlockFi if you havenxe2x80x99t and want to dip your toes in. Join a Discord or Telegram, experiment with DeFi, mint something as an NFT just to see how it works, participate in a DAO.I asked Twitter for ways for Web3-curious people to get involved and start experimenting. You can use this as a starting point: April 9th 2021Or read a16zxe2x80x99s NFT Canon, a monster list of resources.Of course, Ixe2x80x99d love it if you learned by participating in the Power to the Person auction. Whatever you do, experiment. Prices may crash and specific applications may go bust -- that happened in Web1 and Web2, too -- but it feels like wexe2x80x99re on the precipice of something really big. I donxe2x80x99t expect to make a lot of money on this auction; Ixe2x80x99m doing it to experiment, to help to push the boundaries of how value is distributed, and mainly to learn. Itxe2x80x99s worth taking a little time on the weekends to play with these new toys.

Itxe2x80x99s a behind-the-scenes look at one of the worldxe2x80x99s fastest-growing startups, how big funding rounds come together, why valuations make more sense than it seems in headlines, and how Stripe invests. Ixe2x80x99ve told you that Ixe2x80x99m an optimist, and that Ixe2x80x99m going to be effusive about my favorite companies. Thatxe2x80x99s certainly going to happen in this piece. The idea here isnxe2x80x99t to pump up Ramp -- they donxe2x80x99t really need my help -- but to give you a glimpse at what makes a truly exceptional company truly exceptional, even in its earliest days. I hope itxe2x80x99s instructive for people building companies, and investors thinking about where to put their time, attention, and money.Disclosure: This is not a sponsored piece, but I am a small investor in Ramp (this round) and they previously sponsored. Letxe2x80x99s get to it. ^^ Click this to just read the whole thing onlineRampxe2x80x99s Double-Unicorn Rounds: Behind the ScenesRamp is the fastest company to cross the $1 billion valuation mark in New York City history. And it did it twice, within a day.Stripe just valued the two-year-old company at $1.6 billion, right after D1 Capital and other investors valued it at $1.1 billion. All in, Ramp has raised over $300 million. It has never made a fundraising deck.Rounds like the ones Ramp just raised donxe2x80x99t come together often. Peeks behind the curtain when they do are even more rare. Rampxe2x80x99s co-founders, Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh, agreed to share how it all went down. They know that the whole thing is a little crazy, and that a double-round like the one they just put together is uncommon. Thatxe2x80x99s what makes it worth telling.Headlines like xe2x80x9cTwo-year-old company raises two unicorn rounds within dayxe2x80x9d leave you with a lot of questions. What does it feel like to be at the center of a feeding frenzy? What metrics do you need to get a $1 billion valuation two years in? How do you decide which investors to bring onto your cap table? Why two rounds? Luckily, we have answers. Today, wexe2x80x99ll cover: Has Venture Capital Lost Its Mind?Rampxe2x80x99s Ramp: Trajectory and VelocityBehind the Scenes of Rampxe2x80x99s Double-RoundRound Construction: Donxe2x80x99t Optimize for PriceStripe Invests in RampWhatxe2x80x99s Next? This is a story about people, trajectory, and velocity, played out over a long time horizon. Itxe2x80x99s about why it makes sense for investors to pay up for the best companies, and why the best companies care less about price. The market seems frothy, but in many cases, like this one, itxe2x80x99s more thoughtful and rational than it looks. Letxe2x80x99s start with the facts: In December, Ramp, the NYC-based spend management platform and corporate card company, announced a $30 million round led by D1 Capital Partners and Coatue Management. I wrote about it here.In February, it announced $150M in debt financing from Goldman Sachs. Today, Ramp is announcing (themselves) that theyxe2x80x99ve raised $115 million in two back-to-back rounds:One, a $65 million round led by D1 Capital Partners, with participation from Goldman Sachs, Founders Fund, Coatue Management, Thrive Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Box Group, Neo, Contrary Capital, and a roster of angels valuing the company at $1.1 billion.The second, a $50 million round led by Not Boring favorite Stripe at a $1.6 billion valuation.The gut and easy reaction to that is, xe2x80x9cWow, investors have really lost their minds. This is just a sign of the times -- low interest rates during a pandemic -- and itxe2x80x99s not going to end well.xe2x80x9d Yes, interest rates are low. Everyone is raising a mega fund. SoftBank was mocked, but it was just the beginning. Tiger Global just closed a $6.7 billion venture fund. Crossover funds like Coatue, D1, Altimeter, and Greenoaks are going earlier and earlier. Startups themselves are investing in other startups, none more than Stripe. There is more demand (investment dollars) chasing supply (fast-growing startups) than ever. But if youxe2x80x99ve been reading Not Boring, you know I donxe2x80x99t think thatxe2x80x99s the whole story. None of these funds are dumb. Theyxe2x80x99re not trying to light their LPsxe2x80x99 money on fire. Theyxe2x80x99ve seen that tech companies with the right stuff can get faster and bigger than ever before. In Dreams All the Way Up, I wrote that valuations for the best early stage tech companies might actually be low if you look at startup valuations as a probability that the companies become as big as the biggest tech companies, or at least the biggest companies in their categories. If Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are fairly valued, and their market caps have grown faster than startup valuations over the past decade, then either startups have a lower probability of becoming as big as the biggest companies, or theyxe2x80x99re undervalued. Thatxe2x80x99s a numbers-based argument, but therexe2x80x99s a common sense reason that the best startups today should be worth more than the best startups a few years ago were at the same age and stage. As Eric told me, xe2x80x9cThere have never been so many people in and around this ecosystem who get what scale looks like, and have been part of a ride on the way up.xe2x80x9dPlus, new startups have advantages over startups built just a few years ago: Examples of successful exits show that it can be done.Investors have seen those exits and are willing to make bets earlier.Talent with experience building products at scale.Tools that make it easier to build great products more quickly.Today, a top engineering team can take so much good software off the shelf that development timelines have been dramatically compressed. Logan Bartlett, a VC at Redpoint, guessed that just a decade ago, it would have taken seven or eight years for even a great company to build what Ramp did in two. And Ramp did it with a team of less than 100 people. Of course Ramp is worth more, faster today than a similar company would have been before. Companies are getting really big, really fast, and thatxe2x80x99s altering the markets. Letxe2x80x99s say, with all those advantages, that if it would have taken Company A four years to get to $100 million in revenue five years ago, it takes a similar company, Company B, three years to get there today. That seems minor, but itxe2x80x99s a completely different trajectory: Company A is growing at 115% per year and Company B is growing at 216% per year. Over time, that difference gets dramatic.By each companyxe2x80x99s fifth year, Company A, the older one, will be at $215 million in annual revenue. Company B will be at $1 billion. Obviously, a lot of things can change: growth can slow, an early market may get saturated, customers can churn. But it illustrates that trajectory really matters, and it matters more than you can easily comprehend. Company B shouldnxe2x80x99t just fetch the same valuation as Company A when theyxe2x80x99re both at $100 million in revenue; it should be worth more, because itxe2x80x99s growing so much faster. Having seen similar scenarios play out successfully, investors now have a better sense for the impact of compounding at hypergrowth companies, and are more willing to underwrite against it. Theyxe2x80x99re willing to pay more, earlier, because they trust the trajectory. Lest you think Ixe2x80x99m a valuation maximalist, my willingness to apply this logic only extends to the very best companies, the ones that are actually on that trajectory. I think Clubhousexe2x80x99s rumored $4 billion valuation pre-revenue is fucking bonkers, and even though I love Stripe, I do not understand its investments in Fast. For companies like Ramp, though, and there arenxe2x80x99t many, trajectory and velocity are driving high valuations that may look cheap in even a few months. I wrote Ramp: The Card-Sized Finance Team in December, and if youxe2x80x99re interested in more of the Ramp story and strategy, you should check it out. For this piece, I want to highlight the things about Ramp that are relevant to this double-round coming together in the way it did: velocity and trajectory. Theyxe2x80x99re Rampxe2x80x99s Ramp. Ramp can move faster than other payments companies because of how itxe2x80x99s built and what itxe2x80x99s building: itxe2x80x99s an engineering and product-driven company slash corporate card (and not the other way around).Rampxe2x80x99s corporate card is where it makes most of its money today, but really, itxe2x80x99s just a Trojan Horse into the CFO Suite. Rampxe2x80x99s goal isnxe2x80x99t to make the worldxe2x80x99s best corporate card; it wants to help companies spend less money. Seriously, this is what theyxe2x80x99ve been telling investors, too, from the beginning. Herexe2x80x99s an email from Karim to Keith Rabois and Delian Asparouhov at Founders Fund in May 2019.Rampxe2x80x99s strategy is to align itself with customers, decrease spend, and build healthier businesses that can reinvest in growth. Itxe2x80x99s the long-game, but itxe2x80x99s already working. Ramp is in the driverxe2x80x99s seat to own spend management for mid-market companies, and from there, to move upmarket. After wedging into companies with the corporate card, Ramp gives them new software products to help control and manage spend at an astonishing rate. You need both -- the card and the software -- to win.Companies that stay software-only, like Expensify, are getting picked off by companies like Ramp that turn its whole business into a free feature, while companies that focused too heavily on corporate card sales and marketing at the expense of product, like Brex, were caught flat-footed as the card itself became table stakes.Software companies are just faster, and thatxe2x80x99s a major advantage in a massive market with essentially uncapped upside. In a market like that, winning is all about trajectory and velocity. New features help acquire new customers, and retain and delight existing ones by saving them money.How does Ramp ship so fast? People. When Karim, Eric, and I had our first conversation about this piece, Karim highlighted how they think about hiring: xe2x80x9cWe hire people for potential and growth trajectory, slope over intercept. We make bets on people. The goal is not zero defects, but 10x potential.xe2x80x9d The team today, at 85 employees, is absurdly talented. One-third of the team are former founders, and at least five people on the team graduated with perfect GPAs from MIT, Stanford, Harvard, and other top schools. The team also includes a few dropouts. Overall, the team skews heavily towards engineering and design. That, plus conversation with angels and customers, has allowed them to ship at an unbelievable cadence. In an internal email, xe2x80x9c2020 Product Recap,xe2x80x9d Rampxe2x80x99s Head of Product, Geoff Charles, wrote (and I beautified using my Figma skills):  And Ramp just keeps building. Since that December email, Ramp has introduced custom spend controls, more accounting automations, multiple expense policies (i.e. an exec needs a receipt for anything over $100, an intern needs a receipt for anything over $25), more savings insights, more benchmarking, and an integration with 1Password. Theyxe2x80x99re not slowing down. Talent density and product velocity are the difference between excellent and world class. Corporate card competitor Brex has an excellent 4.6 star average rating on G2. Ramp has a perfect 5.0. Not a single one of Rampxe2x80x99s 62 reviews rated it less than a perfect 5.0. Thatxe2x80x99s absurd. Rampxe2x80x99s strategy depends on that customer love. Happy customers tell other customers. They tell investors. And theyxe2x80x99re not just willing but eager to use every new product and feature that Ramp rolls out. When I last wrote about Ramp, I highlighted Ramp Reimbursements, the companyxe2x80x99s Expensify-killer. Who among us doesnxe2x80x99t hate using Expensify? Since then, over the past four months, more than 90% of customers adopted Ramp as a comprehensive spend management platform, replacing Expensify, Concur or manual solutions. People stopped spending money on whole, expensive products and switched over to Ramp. As Ramp adds more features that outcompete entire companiesxe2x80x99 products, and as those products save customers more money, the case for Ramp grows stronger. Ramp makes money on interchange. Like a normal credit card company, it takes a 1.5%-2.5% fee on transactions (paid by merchants/card networks) when customers spend using the card. Unlike a normal credit card company, it doesnxe2x80x99t reward users with points; it rewards them with better software. Better software drives more usage, which drives more revenue, which drives better software, and so on. The faster the flywheel turns, the further ahead Ramp pulls. That velocity is already showing up in Rampxe2x80x99s total purchase volume (TPV) and revenue numbers today. The company is aptly named. Look at this ramp up: Ramp grew monthly purchase volume 60x in 2020, and 47% MoM in December alone. That means that customers spent 60x more on Ramp cards in December than they did in January, which roughly translates to 60x the revenue. Those kinds of numbers bring the investors to the yard. This is where this piece goes from analysis to full behind the scenes. Itxe2x80x99s very unusual to be able to pull back the curtain like this, to get the oral history of a typically secretive process in real-time, but Eric and Karim were down to share how it all went down. I should have known that Ramp was going to raise again soon when, after writing about the company in December, I got a text from my friend Logan at Redpoint: xe2x80x9cHow well do you know Eric from Ramp? Ixe2x80x99m obsessed with them. Like legit am going to do some crazy shit to get involved.xe2x80x9d  And that was before it really started heating up. Three things happened between the time Ramp announced a $30 million round in mid-December and the double-round that ultimately came together in February: revenue growth, Goldman, and the December 2020 Investor Update. First, revenue growth. Rampxe2x80x99s revenue grew a combined 68% in December and January. Growth accelerates everything. Itxe2x80x99s easy to talk about the market being frothy because rounds are coming together so soon after previous ones close, but the growth Ramp saw between November and January would be a strong full year growth rate for a lot of companies. When growth is faster, itxe2x80x99s natural that funding rounds come faster. Second, in February, Ramp announced that it raised $150 million in debt financing from Goldman Sachs. That facility made Rampxe2x80x99s balance sheet much more scalable. More balance sheet means more credit which means both more transaction fees, and more customers to whom it can eventually sell software. Plus, the Goldman Sachs stamp of approval means something. Third, the email: December 2020 Investor Update and Ask, sent on January 12th. This is what really kicked things off. Put yourself in the investorsxe2x80x99 shoes here. Imagine you put some money into a company, and people keep saying great things about it, and it recently raised, and then you get an email that starts out like this:The email induced animal spirits, the sister of xe2x80x9cdeal heat,xe2x80x9d the momentum that builds in a round when a bunch of investors get interested at the same time. Often, founders try to manufacture it by bunching investor meetings together and setting artificial deadlines. Eric and Karim have been playing the long game. After they sold their first company, Paribus, they invested in and advised over 30 companies, many of whom became early sounding boards and customers.They seeded the money for Ramp, and then brought in Delian Asparouhov and Keith Rabois at Founders Fund as the first outside investors (that round was scooped by the same Information reporter as this one). They also brought in a host of founders, CEOs, CFOs, and product leaders as angel investors. Those angels gave product feedback, became customers, and introduced Ramp to customers. They also talked. That was intentional.When Ramp sent the December update, they sent it to a lot of people. Angels arenxe2x80x99t competing to lead the round, they have nothing to lose from talking about Rampxe2x80x99s progress, and they have social capital to gain. That was intentional, it helped create a buzz. This is where the animal spirits really start to kick in. People got the sense that something special was happening, and the vibe was out that a round might come together quickly. Eric told me that after the email went out, things started picking up almost immediately. Phone calls and texts started coming in more frequently. People seemed unusually eager to grab a virtual coffee or to be helpful in any way. Luckily, the team recorded it and shared with me:Call it animal spirits. Call it deal heat. Whatever you call it, it was on. Turns out, a lot of investors were willing to xe2x80x9clegit do crazy shit to get involved.xe2x80x9d Side Note: Logan did end up doing some crazy shit to get Redpoint involved. He sent Ramp a 130-page deck on the product compared to competitors, customer surveys, and strategy. He made over a dozen introductions to top sales and marketing leaders in four weeks. He flipped the xe2x80x9cLet me know how I can be helpfulxe2x80x9d trope into xe2x80x9cLet me show how I can be helpful.xe2x80x9d While Redpoint didnxe2x80x99t get the lead, it got a meaningful allocation in the round. When I asked him what he loved about the company (after I had already written the last section) he said: xe2x80x9cVelocity.xe2x80x9d I donxe2x80x99t think Rampxe2x80x99s heard the last of Logan.While there was a lot of interest, there was only a small group of serious contenders for the lead spot, including Redpoint and many of Rampxe2x80x99s existing investors. D1 Capital, which co-led Rampxe2x80x99s $30 million last round, ended up winning. They had the first conversation about leading a new round in early/mid January, aligned on terms on January 29th, and had a signed term sheet by February 5th.The deal stayed quiet for nearly two months, and almost made it to the official announcement day, when Eric and Karim got this email from a reporter at The Information: The Information published the story later that afternoon.Leaks happen, and no onexe2x80x99s going to feel bad for a two-year-old company that just raised $115 million, but it also kind of sucks. Thatxe2x80x99s big news for the people involved -- Rampxe2x80x99s team and the investors who competed to get in the deal -- and a headline by a reporter you havenxe2x80x99t spoken with on a random Monday drop is a pretty unceremonious way for the world to find out. But the news is one thing. The Information got the what, but not the why or how. Why did Ramp ultimately choose to go with an existing partner instead of bringing in someone new at a much higher price? When you have that much interest at such dizzying valuations, what do you do? How do you decide whose money to take? Picking among a group of world-class investors, all of whom are willing to outbid and out-crazy-shit each other to give you money, is a champagne challenge. But itxe2x80x99s a challenge nonetheless. Eric and Karim described it as a xe2x80x9cweird dance,xe2x80x9d and view cap table allocation (which investors you choose and how much they invest) as a strategy and a means to compete. Herexe2x80x99s their first tip: picking the highest price is almost always the wrong answer. Over the first months of the year, as the energy grew and the animals got more spirited, rumors began to swirl that investors were willing to go up to valuations as high as $2 billion+. Instead of pursuing those, Ramp chose to sell 6% of the company in a D1 led round for $65 million, valuing the company meaningfully below what the high end of the market was seemingly willing to pay.Thatxe2x80x99s a little counterintuitive. Picking the option that allows you to sell the smallest piece of the company for the most cash seems like the right move on paper. But itxe2x80x99s usually not, not in the long-run. Not raising at the highest prices leaves room for three important things: Operating Error. If you donxe2x80x99t set unattainable expectations, you can make some mistakes along the way and everyone comes out fine. You also donxe2x80x99t look like a pig.Excess Demand. If you donxe2x80x99t sell the max amount youxe2x80x99re comfortable with at the time, therexe2x80x99s room to add aligned investors as opportunities arise. (See Stripe below) Employee and Investor Upside. More upside attracts better employees and investors, and makes them happier, which leads to better results over time. Not optimizing for price in the short-term means that you can optimize for terminal value, the only number that really matters. Eric acknowledged that they feel really fortunate to be in a position to be able to do right by people and that Rampxe2x80x99s situation is unique, but he quickly added: At another level, it's not. It's an iterative thing, hopefully you play out over many years and decades. Because of availability of capital, the constrained thing is people. If you can unlock helping people achieve their goals, that speeds up the rest -- talent, excitement, and luck -- you maximize the probability of things going right over time.Maybe because theyxe2x80x99ve been through it before and have an exit under their belt, Eric and Karim are taking a long view with Ramp. Very few companies can pull that off, but one in particular comes to mindxe2x80xa6 Stripe. In a 2016 interview with Ezra Klein, Patrick Collison said: Therexe2x80x99s something quite deep about the notion of using time horizons as a competitive advantage, in that youxe2x80x99re simply willing to wait longer than other people and you have an organization that is thusly oriented.Stripe and Ramp understand the seemingly magical power of combining high velocity and trajectory, positive sum interactions, and long time horizons better than almost anyone. Thatxe2x80x99s not the only thing they have in common. At the same time the D1 round was coming to a close, Stripe was also talking to Ramp about a separate round at a higher valuation. Stripe invested $50 million at a $1.6 billion valuation, a nice quick markup for the investors in the D1 round. On the surface, the benefits are obvious.Ramp gets to use what it sees as the best-in-class issuing platform (Stripe) and benefit from the velocity of Stripe's ongoing development. xe2x80x9cUsing Stripe Issuing will in itself be a competitive advantage,\" explained Eric. And an investment from Stripe, particularly since Stripe has its own Corporate Card, is a little like the fintech equivalent of a knighting. Given the advantages Stripe gives Ramp, the 50% markup is a head scratcher. It makes more sense when you understand what Stripe is building, and how Ramp fits in. What is Stripe building? Stripexe2x80x99s mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. At its core, it does that by building payments infrastructure for the internet. Its APIs are the highway on top of which money zips around the world. In Augustxe2x80x99s Stripe: The Internetxe2x80x99s Most Undervalued Company, I wrote:Longer-term, Stripe is building not just the infrastructure on top of which money moves -- what it calls the Global Payments and Treasury Network -- and the platform on top of which companies are built. It is moving to own every piece of the journey.In December, Ben Thompson wrote Stripe: Platform of Platforms after Stripe announced Treasury and a deeper partnership with Shopify. That announcement, and Thompsonxe2x80x99s piece, helped bring Stripexe2x80x99s strategy into tighter focus: itxe2x80x99s the platform on top of which other platforms build. Stripe builds the back-end, its customers build the front end. Stripe builds APIs that anyone can use, its customers use them to build tailored experiences for a particular target audience. Stripexe2x80x99s products proliferate, and its business grows, when it makes it easy for all sorts of online businesses -- those serving merchants and barbers and writers and CFOs -- to offer their customers better, more reliable, payments experiences, and increasingly, financial products.Stripe is the highway, and its customers are the last mile. When those customers are last-mile fintech startups, Stripe might even invest. How does Stripe invest?I think Stripe is the closest thing the United States tech ecosystem has to Tencent. Tencent invests capital in startups, and then sends them traffic. Itxe2x80x99s not afraid to admit when itxe2x80x99s been beat, and invest in companies building a better version of something it tried to build itself.Stripexe2x80x99s investment strategy seems to be similar. It launched corporate cards in 2019, but corporate cards arenxe2x80x99t the companyxe2x80x99s core focus, let alone spend management and all of the adjacent CFO-suite tooling that Ramp builds. So instead of diverting focus from the core, Stripe can invest in companies whose products orbit its core, providing capital, software, and potentially even traffic.  As its own valuation has climbed, Stripe has ramped up (pun intended) its investing in 2021. According to Crunchbase, it made seven investments in Q1 of 2021, just one shy of the eight investments it made all of last year.All of its investments are focused on increasing the GDP of the internet. Its biggest investments are in fintech companies like Monzo, Check, and Step that provide last-mile financial services instead of core payments infrastructure (well, and Fast, which xf0x9fxa4xb7xf0x9fx8fxbbxe2x80x8dxe2x99x82xefxb8x8f .) Kind of like Rampxe2x80xa6 Why did Stripe invest in Ramp?Stripe and Ramp have known each other for a while. In 2019, Ramp evaluated working with Stripe Issuing when it was just getting started, and even though they went with Marqeta, the two teams stayed close. As the D1 deal was coming together, D1 encouraged Ramp to reach out to Stripe. Since Ramp didnxe2x80x99t take the highest price for the D1 round, and sold only 6% of the business, there was room left for Stripe to invest as much as it might like, and for Ramp to sell more of the company without a painful amount of dilution. But why did Stripe invest? Eric and Karim were open books about the entire process, except when it came to Stripexe2x80x99s thinking. So Ixe2x80x99ll have to speculate here, and I think I see why it makes sense: Stripe and Ramp are both similar and different enough in just the right ways.Stripexe2x80x99s investors and partners include Founders Fund, D1 Capital, Redpoint, Thrive, Goldman Sachs, Coatue, and others. Therexe2x80x99s a lot of overlap on the cap table. Both companies succeed when more economic activity happens online. Stripe was a model for Ramp in thinking about building a nexus of talent in a company since the earliest days, and both companies are very focused on hiring the highest potential engineers and designers in the world. These are similar cultures.Ramp just hired its Chief Business Officer, Colin Kennedy, from Stripe, where he was the Global Head of Partnerships. Both companies have very nice co-founders who play the long game. Both are in the top 0.1% of companies when it comes to product velocity. When I first called that Stripe would be worth more than Goldman in September 2019, I highlighted Stripexe2x80x99s product velocity as a reason: But the two companies are just different enough. Stripe builds infrastructure, Ramp builds customer-facing software. Stripe offers an Issuing API that businesses like Ramp can use to let their customers spin up virtual and physical cards. Stripe doesnxe2x80x99t have a big customer support or sales team. Theyxe2x80x99re an enabler.Stripe serves companies that build software. Ramp is a software company that serves finance teams, and puts all of its energy into solving for that particular audience. Stripe is the highway, Ramp is the last-mile. The two businesses look competitive, but theyxe2x80x99re complementary. When I wrote about Stripe in August, I predicted it might, xe2x80x9cAugment or replace large portions of finance teams with software, improving profits for its businesses.xe2x80x9d It wants online businesses to survive and thrive, and building tools that help finance teams increase profits seemed like a logical extension. I was right on the what, wrong on the how.At the time, I wasnxe2x80x99t as familiar with  Ramp, but thatxe2x80x99s exactly what Ramp does: augments the finance team and helps make businesses more profitable. By investing in Ramp, Stripe gets a step closer to its goal -- making internet businesses bigger and more profitable -- without Stripe having to actually build customer-facing software in-house. Why did Stripe pay a 50% markup? Stripe brings a lot to the table for Ramp. Why did it pay half a billion dollars more than other investors? If youxe2x80x99ve watched Shark Tank, youxe2x80x99ll often hear the Sharks beat founders up on valuation by saying something like, xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m going to make your company 100x more valuable. Wouldnxe2x80x99t you rather own 10% of $1 billion than 100% of nothing?xe2x80x9d Sharks know their value, theyxe2x80x99re on their home turf, and they have the leverage, so they squeeze founders to get the best deals for themselves. That works for first-time founders from the middle of nowhere selling magnetic glasses holders. It doesnxe2x80x99t work on Ramp in the middle of unprecedented growth and a hypercompetitive round. So in this case, with two parties playing the long game, I think the opposite happened. Stripe probably said, xe2x80x9cLook, we can make you at least 50% bigger almost immediately, so that means that we can afford to pay 50% more.xe2x80x9d They identified Ramp as the best product in a space in which they want to play, saw its product as complementary, and sharpened their pencils to make a deal happen. Backed by, and partnered with Stripe, Ramp should be able to grow faster than it could on its own.Itxe2x80x99s like an inverse Schrxc3xb6dinger's investment: is a 50% markup really a 50% premium if the investment makes the company 50% more valuable? After a crazy month, Ramp has $115 million more in the bank, committed investors, and the best partners a fintech company could ask for. When you have all that, what do you do with it? First things first: if you have a lot of money in the bank and Founders Fund on the cap table, you need to open a Miami office. Kidding. That would make it far too easy for Logan to find them. The answer, of course, is that Ramp will use the money and support to increase its velocity and steepen its trajectory by hiring more top people. Remember, it left some valuation on the table to make Rampxe2x80x99s equity attractive to new hires. And theyxe2x80x99ll have no shortage of things to build.Now that Ramp has Trojan Horsed its way into the CFOxe2x80x99s office, where all of the money sits, there are all sorts of things it might do. Businesses spend about $1.5 trillion on corporate and small business cards every year, but B2B spend overall is a $130 trillion market. It could automate savings, like a B2B Paribus or DoNotPay, by recognizing when companies are overspending on products and reaching out to vendors to negotiate on their behalf. It could build the bill.com killer for its customers, bringing AP and credit cards into the same place. It could build APIs to connect all of a companyxe2x80x99s financial software and automate workflows. It could team up with fellow Stripe/Thrive portfolio company, Check, to offer payroll through Ramp.  The Stripe investment hints at something bigger, though. Remember that Stripe is the Platform of Platforms. Ben Thompson Drew it up, and I added a Ramp logoxe2x80xa6 Could Ramp become Shopify for the CFO and Finance Suite? Already, Ramp customers will be able to issue virtual and physical credit cards through Stripe Issuing. Itxe2x80x99s not hard to imagine that Ramp could: Offer bank accounts (like Shopify does with Balance) through Stripe Treasury.Offer financing to customers through Stripe Capital.Handle more B2B payments through Stripe Invoicing and ACH, giving it the ability to play in the full $130 trillion market more quickly.As Stripe builds new products and improves existing ones, Rampxe2x80x99s customers benefit. For the price of an interchange fee that theyxe2x80x99d have to pay to use any corporate card, they get two of the worldxe2x80x99s best and fastest product teams building software to help them make their businesses more profitable.Ramp is playing the long game. If its customers wins, it wins. With Stripe on its side, a fresh $115 million in the bank, velocity and trajectory at its back, and all of business spending to go after, I think these rounds are going to look very cheap, very soon.Thanks to Eric and Karim for letting me behind the curtain, and to Dan for editing.How did you like this weekxe2x80x99s Not Boring?

This is a big one for me: Not Boringxe2x80x99s first birthday. Instead of writing about a very big company, which I normally do on Monday, Ixe2x80x99m writing about a very small one: Not Boring. Itxe2x80x99s been a crazy year, Ixe2x80x99ve learned a ton, and itxe2x80x99s just going to get better from here. But it was not at all obvious that this was going to work out a year ago.

I had quit my job, launched an in-person company that got crushed by lockdowns (and was probably a bad idea anyway), and to top it off, I caught COVID the week I decided to start writing Not Boring. I was lost. Somehow, since then, with all of your help, Ixe2x80x99ve built my dream job. Over the past 365 days, Ixe2x80x99ve:Written and sent 417k words.

I would see people with big followings on Twitter or big subscriber lists and think that they had some special je ne sais quoi. I still think that it could end at any moment. Today, I want to share the Not Boring story as honestly as possible -- it often looks way easier from the outside -- with lessons Ixe2x80x99ve learned on writing, growth, business models, investing, and creator psychology sprinkled in.

As much as I write about strategy, this story is about working hard even when it seems silly and following serendipity. My biggest lesson so far: this is neither as impossible nor easy as it looks.Per My Last EmailIxe2x80x99m cheating a little when I say that itxe2x80x99s Not Boringxe2x80x99s one year birthday. I wrote a different newsletter -- Per My Last Email -- for almost a year before. In early 2019, the board at Breather, where I worked, had just brought in a new CEO, who himself was in the middle of bringing in a new, experienced executive team. A couple weeks into the new regime, Ben Rollert (then VP, Product at Breather, now CEO at Composer) and I presented at an exec team offsite about the need to differentiate and dig moats in an increasingly crowded and bubbly flex office market. We got cut off halfway through with something to the effect of: xe2x80x9cMoats? This is a big market, we donxe2x80x99t need to worry about moats. We have a brand. Thatxe2x80x99s what Apple has.xe2x80x9d I realized that my brain was going to shrivel up and rot if I didnxe2x80x99t do something. Benxe2x80x99s always been smarter than me. He saw the writing on the wall and quit. I couldnxe2x80x99t quit right then -- I managed a 150 person team and didnxe2x80x99t want to abandon them -- so instead, I used my annual learning & development budget to take David Perellxe2x80x99s Write of Passage course.  That was one of the best decisions Ixe2x80x99ve ever made. One of the assignments for the course was to launch a Substack and get twenty people to subscribe. I reserved packym.substack.com, named it Per My Last Email, and begged my few hundred Twitter followers to sign up:May 17th 2019Two days later, I had 28 subscribers, and we were off to the races. I wrote Per My Last Email on the side, spending a few hours each weekend or early in the morning curating links to essays, books, podcasts, and videos with a dash of commentary. It grew to about 400 subscribers in eleven months. It didnxe2x80x99t make a dollar and I didnxe2x80x99t expect that it ever would. But I had always told Puja and my family that if I ever got really rich and retired early, all Ixe2x80x99d want to do is read and write and talk to really smart people. Per My Last Email let me start doing that in a small way. As someone whoxe2x80x99d been so singularly focused on work for a decade, it felt good to have a hobby. Lesson: Make room for hobbies, even just a few hours a week. Not Boring ClubWriting was also a way for me to test out a startup idea I had in a really lightweight way. The idea was Not Boring Club: a mashup of social club and continuing education, Soho House meets college extracurriculars for busy grownups. I wrote about education and IRL Member Communities to make sure there was a real opportunity. One of the problems with being good at writing is that you can convince people that bad ideas are good. You can even convince yourself.In October 2019, I quit Breather to start it. I wrote business plans, memos, started a debate club, made decks, built a website, and tried to write my way into a business model. I couldnxe2x80x99t quite figure it out. I knew what I wanted to exist, but the business model wasnxe2x80x99t clicking.  The people around me -- my sister, Puja, even my mom -- tried to gently tell me that this wasnxe2x80x99t it. They were, in hindsight and in the back of my mind even then, so obviously right. But I persisted, and announced the launch in a blog post. Thankfully, I didnxe2x80x99t raise money or sign a lease. Instead, I decided to start experimenting with a Slack group and a series of in-person events. By February, I started onboarding the first 150 (free) members with a series of small group dinners. On March 10th, we had to xe2x80x9cpostponexe2x80x9d a welcome dinner. Then a Debate Club. Then the next dinner. Then the next dinner.  We quickly moved Not Boring Club online with cocktail making classes, lightning presentations, book clubs, and trivia nights. One day, I was frantically making slides for that nightxe2x80x99s Trivia Night. Puja kind of gave me a look, and I realized how fucking ridiculous it seemed. How fucking ridiculous it was. That night, eight people showed up to play trivia. That was the final straw. I needed to do something different, but I couldnxe2x80x99t figure out what. One thing I knew for sure: I was a terrible online community leader, and I kind of hated it. If Ixe2x80x99m being honest, COVID was a good excuse to erase my mistake. The Not Boring Club went on the back burner. Lesson: Donxe2x80x99t be afraid to admit that something you thought was a good idea turned out to be a bad idea. Youxe2x80x99ll know it in your gut. Trust that instinct and cut bait.Not Boring NewsletterOne year ago, I was locked in my Brooklyn apartment with COVID, feeling incredibly stuck and a little hopeless. Not Boring Club was on indefinite pause. In February, Puja and I found out we were having a baby, and I had zero income. The pressure was on. My brilliant plan? To turn the newsletter into something that could at least pay rent at some point in the future while I tried to figure out what I wanted to do next. Maybe it would even help me find a new job. At the time, I had weekly coaching calls with my mom. (Yup, you read that right.) On one of those calls, when I told her that the newsletter was the thing I was enjoying most and that I wanted to give it a shot, she said, xe2x80x9cWhy donxe2x80x99t you change the name of the newsletter to Not Boring?xe2x80x9d So I did, and announced the change in the Last Per My Last Email in late March 2020. When I sent that email, there were 473 people subscribed to Per My Last Email. I got aggressive and changed my goal from xe2x80x9c1,000 subscribers by the end of the yearxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9c1,000 subscribers by the end of April.xe2x80x9d (At the time, I thought xe2x80x9cend of Aprilxe2x80x9d was synonymous with xe2x80x9cend of quarantine.xe2x80x9d)After I announced the name change, I got a few replies saying, xe2x80x9cOh man, I loved Per My Last Email.xe2x80x9d I called my mom and said that I thought Ixe2x80x99d made a terrible mistake, that Ixe2x80x99d messed up the newsletter too. Things were dark. But then they started to look up. The biggest change from Per My Last Email to Not Boring, other than the name, was that instead of curating links, I started writing long (ok, very long) essays myself. When I started writing, I wanted to write about tech and strategy (one of the first pieces I wrote was on Natively Integrated Companies and another was on Shen Yun and Startup Economics), but I thought the space was too crowded (the first piece I ever wrote was the Best of Ben Thompson). With Not Boring, I went back to the things I wanted to write about all along, the things that I cared about and spent my free time reading and talking about anyway. It got really fun, really quickly. I wrote about Jeff Bezosxe2x80x99 Fashion Flex, then I wrote about Creative Destruction through the lens of the Mickey Mouse Club, then Supply Gluts and Hey Arnold. I realized that I could write about the things that I liked writing about -- strategy, finance, economics, and tech -- even though they were crowded, as long as I wrote about it with my own, unique voice. That was a huge unlock, and a lesson in counter-positioning. Counter-positioning, my favorite of Hamilton Helmerxe2x80x99s 7 Powers, is when, xe2x80x9cA newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.xe2x80x9d Technically, combining strategy, finance, and pop culture isnxe2x80x99t a new business model, nor is it better, but itxe2x80x99s still a moat. Ben Thompson might be better, smarter, more experienced, and more popular, but can you imagine Ben Thompson explaining creative destruction with this image? Now I wasnxe2x80x99t intentionally counter-positioning -- there wasnxe2x80x99t that much foresight -- I was just having fun. In hindsight, I realize that there arenxe2x80x99t a lot of serious analyses out there that donxe2x80x99t take themselves seriously, because when people do serious analysis, they put on their serious analysis pants. The pop culture thing was a lucky accident.After that post last April, something started to click. People were sharing Not Boring. It got picked up by the Financial Times. Subscribers grew 53% in one month. Not Boring was still tiny, but it was starting to find that elusive *product-market fit*. Plus, people were stuck at home and bored. It was time to start focusing on growth. Lesson: Lean into the intersection of what youxe2x80x99re passionate about and whatxe2x80x99s different about you.In May 2020, one year into writing a newsletter, I wrote Looking Back, Forward, and Up to reflect on one year of writing and set goals for the future. My first goal was to hit 5,000 subscribers by the end of the summer, and then turn on paid subscriptions. From that piece: Goal #1: Grow to 5,000 Subscribers by Labor Day and 10,000 by May 21, 2021It took ten months to get to 500, but less than two to get from there to 1,294. Ixe2x80x99ll be testing a bunch of tactics over the next few months to get to 5,000, but the most important will be continuing to improve the content and provide more value so that you want to share it with your smartest friends. Last April, my brother Dan and I I retreated to the beach, shaved off our overgrown pandemic hair, and brainstormed. We decided the best path was to come up with a list of 100 growth ideas. We got to eleven, and did maybe three of them. Ixe2x80x99m not a growth hack person.The most important growth levers over the past year ended up being really simple: quality and consistency. Show up enough for good things to happen every once in a while. From the 473 people that received the last Per My Last Email, wexe2x80x99re now at 42,205 a year later -- 8,803% growth xf0x9fx93x88 . That growth didnxe2x80x99t happen in a straight line. Not Boring has grown through a series of fortunate events, and a lot of help from friends and internet strangers. A few of the highlights: Polina Sharing Per My Last Email in The Profile. In November 2019, Polina Marinova shared Per My Last Email in her excellent newsletter, The Profile, after I won a contest to receive a tote bag full of some of her favorite books. I picked up 49 subscribers in two days, and I thought that was the most incredible thing in the world. Thanks, Polina! Asking People to Share and Launching Not Boring. While I wrote Per My Last Email, I was afraid to ask people to share -- it felt so self-promotional -- so I buried the ask at the bottom of emails. When I announced that I was switching to Not Boring and making it a thing, I asked people to share front and center. People did, and over 100 new subscribers joined that week. Tommy: Product Hunt and ReferralsIn May, I linked up with my friend Tommy Gamba, who came up with a few big unlocks.First and foremost, he said that we should set up a landing page for Not Boring so that we could launch on Product Hunt. He built a landing page using Usmo, I sent an email introducing the homepage to our 1,885 subscribers, and we launched on ProductHunt. Because people read the email and went over to Product Hunt to upvote, we ended up as the #2 Product of the Day, and in the top 5 for the week. We more than doubled subscribers in two days, from 1,800 to 3,700. I remember having dinner with Puja in Athens, NY as the signups rolled in and realizing for the first time that this actually had potential to be my full-time thing. That wouldnxe2x80x99t have happened without Tommy -- thank you, Tommy!! Tommy also launched a Referral Program through which many of you have invited over 2,000 people to join the Not Boring family -- thanks to all of you for telling your friends! Props to the top three referrers: Joakim Jardenberg, Hunter Walk, and Johannes Sundlo. NB xf0x9fx92x99  xf0x9fx87xb8xf0x9fx87xaa .  Writing Essays That People ShareAfter Product Hunt, Not Boring started to pick up momentum. The more people there are reading, the more people who might potentially share. This has been the biggest growth engine for Not Boring, and itxe2x80x99s been totally unpredictable. Some weeks, I write things that I think are great and no one shares them. Others, Ixe2x80x99m embarrassed to hit send and they blow up. A few of the most popular posts include: Tencent: The Ultimate Outsider and Tencentxe2x80x99s Dreams (107,980 combined views) - I sat in the basement for hours and hours looking up Tencentxe2x80x99s investments, and when I asked Dan and Puja to edit the essay, I could tell they both hated it. They told me to break it into two posts, and they became two of the most popular Ixe2x80x99ve written. But it didnxe2x80x99t happen on the first send; it took a thread blowing up to get most of the views.Stripe: The Internetxe2x80x99s Most Undervalued Company (62,159 views) - This highlights an unintentional growth trick Ixe2x80x99ve discovered: when you write about a company with passionate employee bases, they share. APIs All the Way Down (108,421 views) - On Sunday afternoon, I told Puja the essay was terrible and I couldnxe2x80x99t send it. She said she actually loved it, so I sent. It quickly got great feedback and a bunch of shares, then Patrick Oxe2x80x99Shaughnessy shared it essay and brought in a ton of subscribers. Power to the Person (80,376 views) - Li Jin, who coined the phrase Passion Economy and whose work I cited throughout the piece, shared it. Her stamp of approval meant a lot. Excel Never Dies (207,818 views) - I co-wrote this one with Ben Rollert, and we got to the top of Hacker News, linked in the New York Times twice (in Dealbook and Paul Krugmanxe2x80x99s column) and The Browser, and the Excel twitter account even retweeted us. Thatxe2x80x99s been the formula: write a bunch of essays, and sometimes, people will want to share the ones that resonate most with them. Random Dumb Luck and TwitterSo much of Not Boringxe2x80x99s growth has come from dumb luck. A bunch of people subscribed after this tweet about Amazonxe2x80x99s investor slides went viral. Dan Teran included me in a list of newsletter writers he likes reading in May, and I remember watching my inbox that night and seeing names of people I couldnxe2x80x99t believe would ever read what I wrote. Just yesterday, Web and Lenny including me in lists of writers they like brought in over 100 subscribers. Hundreds of other examples, big and small. Ixe2x80x99m missing a ton of you, but every time I see anyone tweet about Not Boring, it means a lot. Shoutouts from people other people trust go 1000x further than me saying things about Not Boring ever could. The past year has been a series of me turning to Puja in disbelief, saying, xe2x80x9cWoah! Person X just tweeted about Not Boring. I love Person X. Holy shit.xe2x80x9d Some of those people have become good friends. I hope that never stops feeling mind-blowingly cool. There have been countless small examples of being in the right place at the right time, and often, that right place has been Twitter. Ixe2x80x99ve made great friends there, and have gotten the chance to interact with so many of you. To join the conversation, follow me and say hi.Not Boringxe2x80x99s subscriber growth looks almost like the hockey stick that startups dream of, but that masks a lot of the bumps. Every time I write something and it doesnxe2x80x99t do well, and every week subscriber growth slows, I feel like the whole thing might be coming to an end. Lesson: Sustainable growth comes from a consistently quality product that people want to share. Growth hacking doesnxe2x80x99t work long-term, but it does help to kick things off. Even though Not Boring has grown so much faster than I expected it would, I canxe2x80x99t shake that feeling that each week is going to be the last, and that soon, youxe2x80x99re all going to wake up to the fact that Ixe2x80x99m just some idiot in a basement writing about things Ixe2x80x99m deeply underqualified to write about. A few weeks ago, I went on ConvertKit founder Nathan Barryxe2x80x99s podcast. A writer I really respect reached out after listening and wrote:I'm listening to your podcast with Nathan Barry. The fear of the lack of interesting topics... I literally thought it was just me.Itxe2x80x99s not. I think itxe2x80x99s everyone. The #1 question I get about Not Boring is what my writing process looks like: how do I choose what to write, research, and put out two essays per week. Letxe2x80x99s take the last one first. I was a runner in high school. I didnxe2x80x99t look like a runner -- I was kinda fat -- but I was good. Steve Prefontaine was a hero, and this quote of his is one of my all-time favorites: Ixe2x80x99m writing this on Easter Sunday. Ixe2x80x99ve been up since 7am after sleeping six restless, post-COVID-vaccine hours. Ixe2x80x99m physically and mentally exhausted. But Ixe2x80x99ve been at the computer for eight hours today. I was at the computer eight hours yesterday. I donxe2x80x99t think Ixe2x80x99m smarter than anyone, but I do think I can outwork everyone. I havenxe2x80x99t taken a day off this year other than the two days I had COVID, the four days after Dev was born, and a week around Christmas, including weekends. Seven days a week, 352 of the past 365 days. Thatxe2x80x99s not a brag. I wish I could take time off. It seemed particularly silly when I was making no money on this newsletter and had to turn down socially distanced hangs with friends or dinners with family to write it. I couldnxe2x80x99t be luckier that Puja was so understanding; I donxe2x80x99t know if I would have been. But Ixe2x80x99m genuinely petrified that each week, if I donxe2x80x99t give it everything I have, could be the last week that Not Boring grows. Even just taking those four days off for Devxe2x80x99s birth, growth slowed from a consistent 1,000 new subscribers per week to 400-500 for the next few weeks. This is a momentum game as much as anything. Thatxe2x80x99s what I mean when I say that doing this is neither as impossible or as easy as it seems from the outside. Itxe2x80x99s taken a ton of hard work. Part of the need for hard work comes from my lack of process. I have a running list of topics that I want to write about in Roam, and every week, when I look at it, I realize that I donxe2x80x99t want to write about anything on that list. Instead, I spend a lot of time on Twitter and talking to people to figure out the most interesting companies and things going on that people donxe2x80x99t quite understand, and then I try to understand and translate. For a Monday piece, that typically means figuring out what Ixe2x80x99m going to write about sometime on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, and starting to research. For APIs All the Way Down, I knew that APIs were important, but I didnxe2x80x99t quite understand what made them special. Then Stripe and Shopify announced a deeper partnership and I wanted to figure out why. So to start, I did a couple things: called two people who could point me in the right direction, and then found every article and podcast I could and dove in. Herexe2x80x99s what my Roam looks like: Each gray dot has rows and rows of notes collapsed under them. I try to absorb as much as possible, and try to figure out what the interesting angle is. Sometimes, there isnxe2x80x99t one, and I need to start over. More often than not, I say there isnxe2x80x99t, whine to Puja that Ixe2x80x99m not going to be able to send something out, and then sit in the basement reading and listening until some idea hits. Often, Ixe2x80x99ll try to outline what Ixe2x80x99m going to write about in Google Docs. Most of the time, it looks empty, like this: Ixe2x80x99m not an outline person. Instead, I just start writing. That little chunk about Stripe and Shopify seemed like a good enough hook to start with, so I went with it. This is how I started my draft in Google Docs:And then I just write, get blocked, mess around on Twitter, hang out with Puja and Dev, start writing again, complain that Ixe2x80x99m not going to be able to get it done again. Then I get back in front of the computer, open up Figma to make some graphics and get the creative juices flowing. That helps -- when Ixe2x80x99m stuck writing, Ixe2x80x99ll pull data, make a chart, create an image-- and at some point, I find some bolt of inspiration, some thread to pull on that will take me most of the way through the essay. Once I have a bad draft, I send it to Puja and my brother Dan, (and occasionally to my sister, Meghan, if I really want it shredded) with some variation of this text: Sometimes Puja edits; Dan always edits. Hexe2x80x99s a hero. The thing I love about having my brother as my editor is that hexe2x80x99s not afraid to tell me when something is terrible, and the reason I like Dan specifically as my editor is because he thinks about all of this stuff as much as me and can give input on the content as well as the structure and form. Then I pace nervously while Dan edits. Sometimes he rips them apart, sometimes he tells me theyxe2x80x99re actually good and gives a few copy edits. This is normally Sunday night. Then I read through, make the edits, leave notes for what to do in the morning, and go to sleep. I wake up around 5:30am on Monday, read through with fresh eyes, make more changes, and make any last graphics, like the title image. Then I copy it over from GDoc to Substack, open up Descript, and read the whole thing into the mic for the audio version. Sometimes, I run out of time and need to hit send before finishing the audio version, in which case I send, tweet, and go back to recording. I publish the audio version, go upstairs, and fret over my open rate and how many likes my tweet about the essay got. Then I take a couple hours off and start over for Thursday. Every. Single. Week.  In August, I tweeted that my writing process looks like this: Eight months later, itxe2x80x99s still the same. Itxe2x80x99s a psychological roller coaster. I legitimately think itxe2x80x99s all over every week. That may never change, and I think Not Boring will be OK as long as it doesnxe2x80x99t.Lesson: You should take no lessons from my process other than, xe2x80x9cIf he can do it, I can do it.xe2x80x9dSomehow, despite that process, Not Boring has survived and grown. Growth is one side of the coin, but growth alone doesnxe2x80x99t put food on the table, and itxe2x80x99s an awful lot of work to do for free. So the second goal that I laid out in May 2020 was to start making money: Goal #2: Make Enough Money From the Newsletter to Cover RentWithin the next 6 months, I want to launch a paid version of the newsletter. By this time next year, I want to be making enough from it to cover rent or mortgage payments.The Passion Economy is taking off, enabling thousands to make a living off of what they create. Personally, I love the idea that covering the basics doing something that I love will allow me to take bigger swings elsewhere.At the time, after listening to all of the Substack hype around subscriptions, I assumed that I, too, would charge people to read the newsletter. Ultimately, I decided that was the wrong move for Not Boring. Why? As with everything, therexe2x80x99s not one right answer for everyone. The key is this: your product, growth strategy, and business model need to be connected. Both subscription- and advertising-based models have pros and cons, and make sense for different types of writers:  Subscriptions have pros and cons:Pro: generate predictable cashflowsPro: allow writers to focus on writing quality content for their core audience instead of optimizing for clicks (the argument goes)Pro: subscription-based writers arenxe2x80x99t beholden to their advertisers and can therefore write whatever they want without fear of retributionCon: Harder to grow because content is behind a paywallCon: People will only pay for so many subscriptionsCon: When someone subscribes for a year, you need to write for a year Good for: Topics with a clear focus, especially work-related ones that can be expensedAdvertising does too:Pro: Free content means readers can share and drive growthPro: Makes content more broadly accessible. Another way to look at it is that advertisers are paying for everyonexe2x80x99s subscriptionPro: Writers can experiment and dance around more since people didnxe2x80x99t pay for a particular type of contentPro: OptionalityCon: Need to spend time doing ad sales and writing ad copyCon: Ads take space that people need to read before getting to the meatGood for: More general content with wider appeal For Not Boring, a few of things pushed me over to the sponsorship side, where I happily live to this day. Product/Content. Not Boring is a little all over the place. Itxe2x80x99s not focused on a particular niche. The most successful subscription newsletters are focused: Pomp writes about Bitcoin, Lenny writes about Product Management, Web writes about commerce, Mario writes about tech from idea to IPO, Ian writes about fintech, and Polina writes profiles. A less clear focus means that itxe2x80x99s harder for people to justify expensing Not Boring. Growth. Not Boring grows mainly through word of mouth. Putting the best content behind a paywall means that people canxe2x80x99t share the best stuff. I want as many people as possible to read and share what I write.Math. I did some rough math when I was making the decision, and realized that I could probably make a lot more money over time with sponsorships assuming that keeping the newsletter free meant growing faster. If you want to run the model with your own assumptions: Subscription v. Ads ModelIt turns out that I undershot a little bit. Sponsorships were definitely the right call for Not Boring. But how to find sponsors? First, fake it xe2x80x98til you make it. I did Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) deals with The Hustle and Readwise. I only got paid if I drove results. They were not big money, but they were examples I could point to and say, xe2x80x9cYes yes of course, I have a booming advertiser base.xe2x80x9d Second, rely on a little help from friends. Ankur Nagpal, the founder and CEO of Teachable and a good friend, read Not Boring and said he wanted to sponsor it to promote Teachablexe2x80x99s Share What You Know Summit. Third, put it out into the universe. Puja was infinitely patient with me: seven months pregnant, and married to a free newsletter writer who hadnxe2x80x99t made a dime. She gently suggested that I make a deck and use it to start selling sponsorships. Finally, I listened. I surveyed Not Boring readers to learn more about their backgrounds, professions, and preferences, and with examples of previous sponsorships in hand, put together a rough sponsorship deck. Instead of doing outbound sales, because I hate selling, once I had the deck, I decided to tweet it out into the universe. September 11th 2020The Twitter thread worked: it brought in all of the sponsors for the rest of 2020, including todayxe2x80x99s sponsor, Public, and other Not Boring Sponsors that you know and love. From there, sponsorship has spread, like the newsletter itself, through word of mouth. Today, Not Boring makes money directly in two ways: Top of Newsletter Sponsorships. This is the sponsorship format youxe2x80x99re familiar with from newsletters and media everywhere: 150 words and a logo at the top of the newsletter. I charge a little more for Mondays than Thursdays because Mondays tend to go more viral. I picked rates out of thin air in the beginning, and then upped them at Jacob Donnellyxe2x80x99s suggestion. Ixe2x80x99ve grown rates in line with audience size ever since. Sponsored Deep Dives. A couple times a month, I dedicate a Thursday newsletter to a paid deep dive on some of the startups I think are most fascinating or encapsulate an important trend. The companies Ixe2x80x99ve written about would make a strong venture portfolio: Ramp, MainStreet, Pipe, Masterworks, Fundrise, AltoIRA, UserLeap, and Secureframe, with some more great companies on the way: This format was a risk -- sponsored content can be hit or miss, and people generally have mixed feelings about it. Itxe2x80x99s particularly challenging for me because Ixe2x80x99m so naturally optimistic. When I write a Sponsored Deep Dive, I try to write it in the same way that Ixe2x80x99d write a normal Monday post, but since Ixe2x80x99m being paid, I get feedback that I need to be even more critical about the company than I normally would. (Read how I choose which companies to write about here).Generally, though, these Sponsored Deep Dives get more positive feedback than I was expecting, and give people a behind the scenes look at companies that normally donxe2x80x99t share much information publicly. Theyxe2x80x99re here to stay, and Ixe2x80x99m going to be tweaking and evolving these based on feedback in the coming months. So far, sponsorships have proven to be the right path for Not Boring. After many months of generating no revenue, the business side of Not Boring is starting to pick up steam, and April is set to be the best month yet: Not Boring is going better than I expected and just hit an inflection point, and Ixe2x80x99m incredibly grateful for that. One of the challenges with the newsletter business, though, is that therexe2x80x99s xe2x80x9ckey man risk.xe2x80x9d To a potential buyer or investor, that means that itxe2x80x99s a tough investment, because if I get hit by a bus, the business is dead. Thatxe2x80x99s even tougher for me and my family: if I get hit by a busxe2x80xa6 you get it. That means that even though this is my own business, Ixe2x80x99m still the labor, and we all know that capital makes more money than labor. Fortunately, a happy accident of the decision to stay free is that Not Boringxe2x80x99s increased surface area has opened up new and unexpected opportunities, the most exciting of which is the ability to invest in startups together. Lesson: When your business model, product, and growth strategy align, magic happens. Back in June, my friend Fed Novikov reached out. After some time running the Backyard project at Airbnbxe2x80x99s Samara, he and his brother, Petr, were starting their own company, Apt. Fed and I had discussed the Natively Integrated approach before, and the Novikovs were using it to build their business. He asked if I would be up to write about Apt and why the Natively Integrated approach makes sense for real estate development. I was. We also talked to Jonathan Wasserstrum, who runs a leading AngelList syndicate, and he agreed to syndicate the deal. In July, I wrote the first Not Boring Investment Memo: Apt: The Natively Integrated Developer, and accredited readers were able to invest through Jonathanxe2x80x99s syndicate. It went well, and Fed suggested that I start a syndicate for Not Boring. I hadnxe2x80x99t thought about doing anything venture-related before he suggested it, but agreed there was a compelling opportunity. On one side, I could help founders explain what they do. On the other, I could demystify startup investing, which seemed like a dark art reserved for a chosen few.Just writing about companies is one thing, but putting my money where my mouth is, and giving readers the opportunity to do the same, gave me more skin in the game. Plus, I thought that we could give portfolio companies an early advantage by helping them tell their story to potential customers, employees, and investors.In late July, we launched the Not Boring Syndicate with a memo on Composer. Since then, over 900 Not Boring readers have joined the Syndicate, and together, wexe2x80x99ve invested $1.88 million in fourteen startups: The things that we hoped would happen -- companies can attract customers, employees, and investors -- are actually happening. Plus, having a big group of investors and a loud microphone behind you can tip the scales in foundersxe2x80x99 favor. These tweets from Kaeya, Ben, and Ian, the founders of Swaypay, Composer, and Outfit, are what itxe2x80x99s all about: As an added bonus, the Syndicate has been a fun way to let readers participate and build relationships without launching a traditional community. Michael Batnick wrote about the experience as an LP in Everything is Oversubscribed. That made my week. Until the day we sent the Apt memo, I never imagined that Not Boring would be able to invest in the companies I write about. Even though I worked at a startup, I was still very much an operator and an outsider. As I hope comes across in my writing, Ixe2x80x99m consistently blown away by the companies people build. I know how hard it is; I failed when I tried to do it myself. This is just the beginning of Not Boring as an investor. More to come on that front very soon xf0x9fx91x80Lesson: More people getting involved in startup investing shifts the balance of power to founders, where it should be. Practically everything good that's happened for Not Boring so far has been a happy accident. For someone who spends so much time writing about strategy, Ixe2x80x99ve put surprisingly little thought into the strategy behind Not Boring. Itxe2x80x99s just a newsletter.  But over the past few months -- I think mainly because Ixe2x80x99m doing something that I genuinely love doing, analyzing companies and telling their stories, so when adjacent opportunities arise, I seize them -- things have started to come together in powerful ways. Not Boring is developing a flywheel. In early March, Jake Singer wrote a piece on Not Boring called Million Dollar Newsletter in his newsletter, The Flywheel. I didnxe2x80x99t want to do the piece originally because I thought I would come across as an asshole for having an essay written on me (Not Boring and I are one in the same, itxe2x80x99s different than a normal company). But here I am 5,000 words into writing about myself, so wexe2x80x99re past asshole level now, and the Not Boring Flywheel is worth exploring. Jake wrote:Packy is a better investor because of his writing, and hexe2x80x99s a better writer because of his investing. You canxe2x80x99t make up a better flywheel even if you tried:I think he nailed it, but I want to give a concrete example of how it works, and how I decide what to do now that itxe2x80x99s spinning. It starts with writing about tech companies and trends. Writing (or podcasting, TikTokking, YouTubing, etcxe2x80xa6) attracts people who are interested in the same things you are, and people are the most important part of all of this. Putting your thoughts out there also repels people who donxe2x80x99t like the way you think -- that helps too, it saves time. Writing essays led me to reconnect with Fed, which led me to write the Apt memo, which led to the Syndicate. Investment memos for the Syndicate showed other startups that I could help tell their story, regardless of whether theyxe2x80x99re raising. Thatxe2x80x99s how Sponsored Deep Dives were born.Working closely with companies on Sponsored Deep Dives has created some of my strongest relationships in tech, led to investment opportunities for the Syndicate, and introductions to more companies to write about and invest in (thanks especially to Nick Abouzeid and Mike Wenner for spreading the word about Not Boring!) They also pay the bills, and give me access to companies building the future, which means I can do this full-time and informs my Monday essays, which kicks the whole thing off again. As the flywheel spins, the audience grows, which gives Not Boring access to new ideas, people, and companies and (hopefully) makes Not Boring more useful to readers, partners, and portfolio companies. As I think about whatxe2x80x99s next for Not Boring, new things need to feed the Flywheel.Lesson: Flywheels work, even if theyxe2x80x99re accidental. I hope Ixe2x80x99ve made this clear throughout, but if I havenxe2x80x99t, let me say it again: I find it incredibly fucking wild that so many of you read the words that I write. I still view this newsletter today as just a bigger version of the little thing it was a year ago with a few friends and random internet people, but I also realize that with more readers comes more responsibility. That said: I am not a journalist. Ixe2x80x99ll never lie and Ixe2x80x99ll always tell the truth, but what I said at the top of the first Not Boring Newsletter remains true today: The only things Ixe2x80x99m not optimistic about are cynics and xe2x80x9cwell, actuallyxe2x80xa6xe2x80x9d people. Itxe2x80x99s easy to dunk. Itxe2x80x99s easy to look smart saying why things arenxe2x80x99t going to work. But those people are not our people. Not Boring is for the optimists, and for the people trying to make crazy things happen. Ixe2x80x99m definitely going to be biased. Ixe2x80x99m going to have the backs of the companies in which we invest, and the companies that support Not Boring. So whatxe2x80x99s next for Not Boring? The answer is, just like a year ago, I have no idea. Unlike a year ago, though, I have 365 days of not knowing, growing, and figuring it out under my belt, and Ixe2x80x99m ecstatic to see where serendipity leads us over the next 365. What I do know is that I unapologetically want Not Boring to be a big business. I want to blur the lines between analyzing, experimenting with, investing in, and promoting the companies and products that I canxe2x80x99t stop thinking about. I want to help companies tell their stories.In the immediate future, there are a few things Ixe2x80x99m incredibly excited about. I canxe2x80x99t share details on two of them quite yet, but one involves investing and the other involves experimenting with some of the Web3 tech Ixe2x80x99ve written about. Both are expressions of Power to the Person. Expect more Twitter Spaces: Spaces Cadets with Austin Rief and The Idea Dinner with Mario Gabriele and Acquiredxe2x80x99s Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal.  Long $TWTR!Ixe2x80x99ll also probably start building a little infrastructure under Not Boring -- a new website, maybe a part-time employee or two (perhaps an EA?) -- just in case I get hit by a bus. Mostly, though, Ixe2x80x99m just going to keep writing and following this thing wherever it takes me. When I asked for questions that my Twitter followers had about Not Boring, Tom Critchlow, one of the first Not Boring subscribers and a great writer himself, replied with this: Hexe2x80x99s right. This has been an entirely iterative process. There have been big ups, and even the littlest down feels like the end of the world, but Ixe2x80x99ve tried to listen to your feedback to move it in the right direction. This only works if wexe2x80x99re all into it. Ixe2x80x99ve gone from having one boss to 42,200. Letxe2x80x99s keep iterating and building this together:What do you want to see from Not Boring?THANK YOUThis is just a newsletter, and I probably spilled way too many words on it, but Ixe2x80x99m bewildered and grateful to have this opportunity. It wasnxe2x80x99t guaranteed by any stretch of the imagination, and still isnxe2x80x99t, but I wouldnxe2x80x99t even have a chance without:All of you who give me your time each weekEveryone whoxe2x80x99s helped grow Not Boring by sharing essays and saying nice thingsNathan and Dan for bringing together the Type House and giving me the opportunity to meet so many people who Ixe2x80x99ve read and loved for a long timeTommy for kickstarting Not Boringxe2x80x99s growthEveryone who has written guest posts: Ali, Jeremy, Reuben, Gil, DanEveryone whoxe2x80x99s collaborated with me on posts: Ben, Dror, Marc, RyanSponsors who let me tell their story Founders who let the Not Boring Syndicate join their adventure My mom for being my coach, my sister for telling me when Ixe2x80x99m an idiot (and for letting us invest in her company), and my dad for bouncing ideas back and forth and being supportive about me writing a free newsletter after everything he spent on my education.My in-laws, who let me turn their basement into Not Boring HQFinally, there are two people I couldnxe2x80x99t do this without, and for whom Ixe2x80x99m incredibly grateful: My brother Dan for being my thought partner, calling me on my bullshit, and giving up countless weekend and late-night hours to edit nearly every Not Boring essay this year.My wife Puja for letting me take a big risk on writing this with no income for months and months as I told her xe2x80x9ctrust me itxe2x80x99s just a math problem, once I hit a certain number of subscribers Ixe2x80x99ll be able to make a little money,xe2x80x9d even with a baby on the way. Now that Dev is here, I couldnxe2x80x99t ask for a better mom for him. Thanks for putting up with my moaning every week while doing 100x more than I do and making it look easy (and looking good while doing it all). Thanks for a very Not Boring year :) Thanks Dan, Puja, and Meg for editing!

This is a big one for me: Not Boringxe2x80x99s first birthday. Instead of writing about a very big company, which I normally do on Monday, Ixe2x80x99m writing about a very small one: Not Boring. Itxe2x80x99s been a crazy year, Ixe2x80x99ve learned a ton, and itxe2x80x99s just going to get better from here. But it was not at all obvious that this was going to work out a year ago. Before we get to it, I just want to say a big thank you. Nothing in this story would have happened without you reading, commenting, conversing, and sharing. I feel very lucky that youxe2x80x99re willing to take time out of your day to read what I write. If you want to bring some smart, curious friends along for year two: ShareToday's Not Boring is brought to you a Not Boring Day One-erFun Fact: Public was the first company ever to sponsor multiple Not Boring newsletters.

I had quit my job, launched an in-person company that got crushed by lockdowns (and was probably a bad idea anyway), and to top it off, I caught COVID the week I decided to start writing Not Boring. I was lost. Somehow, since then, with all of your help, Ixe2x80x99ve built my dream job. Over the past 365 days, Ixe2x80x99ve:Written and sent 417k words. Thatxe2x80x99s more than all seven Chronicles of Narnia. Grown from under 500 subscribers to over 42,000.Run a syndicate which has invested nearly $2 million in fourteen companies. Generated more revenue than Ixe2x80x99ve ever made in a full-time job. I legitimately didnxe2x80x99t believe this was possible. I would see people with big followings on Twitter or big subscriber lists and think that they had some special je ne sais quoi. I still think that it could end at any moment. Today, I want to share the Not Boring story as honestly as possible -- it often looks way easier from the outside -- with lessons Ixe2x80x99ve learned on writing, growth, business models, investing, and creator psychology sprinkled in.

As much as I write about strategy, this story is about working hard even when it seems silly and following serendipity. My biggest lesson so far: this is neither as impossible nor easy as it looks.Per My Last EmailIxe2x80x99m cheating a little when I say that itxe2x80x99s Not Boringxe2x80x99s one year birthday. I wrote a different newsletter -- Per My Last Email -- for almost a year before. In early 2019, the board at Breather, where I worked, had just brought in a new CEO, who himself was in the middle of bringing in a new, experienced executive team. A couple weeks into the new regime, Ben Rollert (then VP, Product at Breather, now CEO at Composer) and I presented at an exec team offsite about the need to differentiate and dig moats in an increasingly crowded and bubbly flex office market. We got cut off halfway through with something to the effect of: xe2x80x9cMoats? This is a big market, we donxe2x80x99t need to worry about moats. We have a brand. Thatxe2x80x99s what Apple has.xe2x80x9d I realized that my brain was going to shrivel up and rot if I didnxe2x80x99t do something. Benxe2x80x99s always been smarter than me. He saw the writing on the wall and quit. I couldnxe2x80x99t quit right then -- I managed a 150 person team and didnxe2x80x99t want to abandon them -- so instead, I used my annual learning & development budget to take David Perellxe2x80x99s Write of Passage course.  That was one of the best decisions Ixe2x80x99ve ever made. One of the assignments for the course was to launch a Substack and get twenty people to subscribe. I reserved packym.substack.com, named it Per My Last Email, and begged my few hundred Twitter followers to sign up:May 17th 2019Two days later, I had 28 subscribers, and we were off to the races. I wrote Per My Last Email on the side, spending a few hours each weekend or early in the morning curating links to essays, books, podcasts, and videos with a dash of commentary. It grew to about 400 subscribers in eleven months. It didnxe2x80x99t make a dollar and I didnxe2x80x99t expect that it ever would. But I had always told Puja and my family that if I ever got really rich and retired early, all Ixe2x80x99d want to do is read and write and talk to really smart people. Per My Last Email let me start doing that in a small way. As someone whoxe2x80x99d been so singularly focused on work for a decade, it felt good to have a hobby. Lesson: Make room for hobbies, even just a few hours a week. Not Boring ClubWriting was also a way for me to test out a startup idea I had in a really lightweight way. The idea was Not Boring Club: a mashup of social club and continuing education, Soho House meets college extracurriculars for busy grownups. I wrote about education and IRL Member Communities to make sure there was a real opportunity. One of the problems with being good at writing is that you can convince people that bad ideas are good. You can even convince yourself.In October 2019, I quit Breather to start it. I wrote business plans, memos, started a debate club, made decks, built a website, and tried to write my way into a business model. I couldnxe2x80x99t quite figure it out. I knew what I wanted to exist, but the business model wasnxe2x80x99t clicking.  The people around me -- my sister, Puja, even my mom -- tried to gently tell me that this wasnxe2x80x99t it. They were, in hindsight and in the back of my mind even then, so obviously right. But I persisted, and announced the launch in a blog post. Thankfully, I didnxe2x80x99t raise money or sign a lease. Instead, I decided to start experimenting with a Slack group and a series of in-person events. By February, I started onboarding the first 150 (free) members with a series of small group dinners. On March 10th, we had to xe2x80x9cpostponexe2x80x9d a welcome dinner. Then a Debate Club. Then the next dinner. Then the next dinner.  We quickly moved Not Boring Club online with cocktail making classes, lightning presentations, book clubs, and trivia nights. One day, I was frantically making slides for that nightxe2x80x99s Trivia Night. Puja kind of gave me a look, and I realized how fucking ridiculous it seemed. How fucking ridiculous it was. That night, eight people showed up to play trivia. That was the final straw. I needed to do something different, but I couldnxe2x80x99t figure out what. One thing I knew for sure: I was a terrible online community leader, and I kind of hated it. If Ixe2x80x99m being honest, COVID was a good excuse to erase my mistake. The Not Boring Club went on the back burner. Lesson: Donxe2x80x99t be afraid to admit that something you thought was a good idea turned out to be a bad idea. Youxe2x80x99ll know it in your gut. Trust that instinct and cut bait.Not Boring NewsletterOne year ago, I was locked in my Brooklyn apartment with COVID, feeling incredibly stuck and a little hopeless. Not Boring Club was on indefinite pause. In February, Puja and I found out we were having a baby, and I had zero income. The pressure was on. My brilliant plan? To turn the newsletter into something that could at least pay rent at some point in the future while I tried to figure out what I wanted to do next. Maybe it would even help me find a new job. At the time, I had weekly coaching calls with my mom. (Yup, you read that right.) On one of those calls, when I told her that the newsletter was the thing I was enjoying most and that I wanted to give it a shot, she said, xe2x80x9cWhy donxe2x80x99t you change the name of the newsletter to Not Boring?xe2x80x9d So I did, and announced the change in the Last Per My Last Email in late March 2020. When I sent that email, there were 473 people subscribed to Per My Last Email. I got aggressive and changed my goal from xe2x80x9c1,000 subscribers by the end of the yearxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9c1,000 subscribers by the end of April.xe2x80x9d (At the time, I thought xe2x80x9cend of Aprilxe2x80x9d was synonymous with xe2x80x9cend of quarantine.xe2x80x9d)After I announced the name change, I got a few replies saying, xe2x80x9cOh man, I loved Per My Last Email.xe2x80x9d I called my mom and said that I thought Ixe2x80x99d made a terrible mistake, that Ixe2x80x99d messed up the newsletter too. Things were dark. But then they started to look up. The biggest change from Per My Last Email to Not Boring, other than the name, was that instead of curating links, I started writing long (ok, very long) essays myself. When I started writing, I wanted to write about tech and strategy (one of the first pieces I wrote was on Natively Integrated Companies and another was on Shen Yun and Startup Economics), but I thought the space was too crowded (the first piece I ever wrote was the Best of Ben Thompson). With Not Boring, I went back to the things I wanted to write about all along, the things that I cared about and spent my free time reading and talking about anyway. It got really fun, really quickly. I wrote about Jeff Bezosxe2x80x99 Fashion Flex, then I wrote about Creative Destruction through the lens of the Mickey Mouse Club, then Supply Gluts and Hey Arnold. I realized that I could write about the things that I liked writing about -- strategy, finance, economics, and tech -- even though they were crowded, as long as I wrote about it with my own, unique voice. That was a huge unlock, and a lesson in counter-positioning. Counter-positioning, my favorite of Hamilton Helmerxe2x80x99s 7 Powers, is when, xe2x80x9cA newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.xe2x80x9d Technically, combining strategy, finance, and pop culture isnxe2x80x99t a new business model, nor is it better, but itxe2x80x99s still a moat. Ben Thompson might be better, smarter, more experienced, and more popular, but can you imagine Ben Thompson explaining creative destruction with this image? Now I wasnxe2x80x99t intentionally counter-positioning -- there wasnxe2x80x99t that much foresight -- I was just having fun. In hindsight, I realize that there arenxe2x80x99t a lot of serious analyses out there that donxe2x80x99t take themselves seriously, because when people do serious analysis, they put on their serious analysis pants. The pop culture thing was a lucky accident.After that post last April, something started to click. People were sharing Not Boring. It got picked up by the Financial Times. Subscribers grew 53% in one month. Not Boring was still tiny, but it was starting to find that elusive *product-market fit*. Plus, people were stuck at home and bored. It was time to start focusing on growth. Lesson: Lean into the intersection of what youxe2x80x99re passionate about and whatxe2x80x99s different about you.In May 2020, one year into writing a newsletter, I wrote Looking Back, Forward, and Up to reflect on one year of writing and set goals for the future. My first goal was to hit 5,000 subscribers by the end of the summer, and then turn on paid subscriptions. From that piece: Goal #1: Grow to 5,000 Subscribers by Labor Day and 10,000 by May 21, 2021It took ten months to get to 500, but less than two to get from there to 1,294. Ixe2x80x99ll be testing a bunch of tactics over the next few months to get to 5,000, but the most important will be continuing to improve the content and provide more value so that you want to share it with your smartest friends. Last April, my brother Dan and I I retreated to the beach, shaved off our overgrown pandemic hair, and brainstormed. We decided the best path was to come up with a list of 100 growth ideas. We got to eleven, and did maybe three of them. Ixe2x80x99m not a growth hack person.The most important growth levers over the past year ended up being really simple: quality and consistency. Show up enough for good things to happen every once in a while. From the 473 people that received the last Per My Last Email, wexe2x80x99re now at 42,205 a year later -- 8,803% growth xf0x9fx93x88 . That growth didnxe2x80x99t happen in a straight line. Not Boring has grown through a series of fortunate events, and a lot of help from friends and internet strangers. A few of the highlights: Polina Sharing Per My Last Email in The Profile. In November 2019, Polina Marinova shared Per My Last Email in her excellent newsletter, The Profile, after I won a contest to receive a tote bag full of some of her favorite books. I picked up 49 subscribers in two days, and I thought that was the most incredible thing in the world. Thanks, Polina! Asking People to Share and Launching Not Boring. While I wrote Per My Last Email, I was afraid to ask people to share -- it felt so self-promotional -- so I buried the ask at the bottom of emails. When I announced that I was switching to Not Boring and making it a thing, I asked people to share front and center. People did, and over 100 new subscribers joined that week. Tommy: Product Hunt and ReferralsIn May, I linked up with my friend Tommy Gamba, who came up with a few big unlocks.First and foremost, he said that we should set up a landing page for Not Boring so that we could launch on Product Hunt. He built a landing page using Usmo, I sent an email introducing the homepage to our 1,885 subscribers, and we launched on ProductHunt. Because people read the email and went over to Product Hunt to upvote, we ended up as the #2 Product of the Day, and in the top 5 for the week. We more than doubled subscribers in two days, from 1,800 to 3,700. I remember having dinner with Puja in Athens, NY as the signups rolled in and realizing for the first time that this actually had potential to be my full-time thing. That wouldnxe2x80x99t have happened without Tommy -- thank you, Tommy!! Tommy also launched a Referral Program through which many of you have invited over 2,000 people to join the Not Boring family -- thanks to all of you for telling your friends! Props to the top three referrers: Joakim Jardenberg, Hunter Walk, and Johannes Sundlo. NB xf0x9fx92x99  xf0x9fx87xb8xf0x9fx87xaa .  Writing Essays That People ShareAfter Product Hunt, Not Boring started to pick up momentum. The more people there are reading, the more people who might potentially share. This has been the biggest growth engine for Not Boring, and itxe2x80x99s been totally unpredictable. Some weeks, I write things that I think are great and no one shares them. Others, Ixe2x80x99m embarrassed to hit send and they blow up. A few of the most popular posts include: Tencent: The Ultimate Outsider and Tencentxe2x80x99s Dreams (107,980 combined views) - I sat in the basement for hours and hours looking up Tencentxe2x80x99s investments, and when I asked Dan and Puja to edit the essay, I could tell they both hated it. They told me to break it into two posts, and they became two of the most popular Ixe2x80x99ve written. But it didnxe2x80x99t happen on the first send; it took a thread blowing up to get most of the views.Stripe: The Internetxe2x80x99s Most Undervalued Company (62,159 views) - This highlights an unintentional growth trick Ixe2x80x99ve discovered: when you write about a company with passionate employee bases, they share. APIs All the Way Down (108,421 views) - On Sunday afternoon, I told Puja the essay was terrible and I couldnxe2x80x99t send it. She said she actually loved it, so I sent. It quickly got great feedback and a bunch of shares, then Patrick Oxe2x80x99Shaughnessy shared it essay and brought in a ton of subscribers. Power to the Person (80,376 views) - Li Jin, who coined the phrase Passion Economy and whose work I cited throughout the piece, shared it. Her stamp of approval meant a lot. Excel Never Dies (207,818 views) - I co-wrote this one with Ben Rollert, and we got to the top of Hacker News, linked in the New York Times twice (in Dealbook and Paul Krugmanxe2x80x99s column) and The Browser, and the Excel twitter account even retweeted us. Thatxe2x80x99s been the formula: write a bunch of essays, and sometimes, people will want to share the ones that resonate most with them. Random Dumb Luck and TwitterSo much of Not Boringxe2x80x99s growth has come from dumb luck. A bunch of people subscribed after this tweet about Amazonxe2x80x99s investor slides went viral. Dan Teran included me in a list of newsletter writers he likes reading in May, and I remember watching my inbox that night and seeing names of people I couldnxe2x80x99t believe would ever read what I wrote. Just yesterday, Web and Lenny including me in lists of writers they like brought in over 100 subscribers. Hundreds of other examples, big and small. Ixe2x80x99m missing a ton of you, but every time I see anyone tweet about Not Boring, it means a lot. Shoutouts from people other people trust go 1000x further than me saying things about Not Boring ever could. The past year has been a series of me turning to Puja in disbelief, saying, xe2x80x9cWoah! Person X just tweeted about Not Boring. I love Person X. Holy shit.xe2x80x9d Some of those people have become good friends. I hope that never stops feeling mind-blowingly cool. There have been countless small examples of being in the right place at the right time, and often, that right place has been Twitter. Ixe2x80x99ve made great friends there, and have gotten the chance to interact with so many of you. To join the conversation, follow me and say hi.Not Boringxe2x80x99s subscriber growth looks almost like the hockey stick that startups dream of, but that masks a lot of the bumps. Every time I write something and it doesnxe2x80x99t do well, and every week subscriber growth slows, I feel like the whole thing might be coming to an end. Lesson: Sustainable growth comes from a consistently quality product that people want to share. Growth hacking doesnxe2x80x99t work long-term, but it does help to kick things off. Even though Not Boring has grown so much faster than I expected it would, I canxe2x80x99t shake that feeling that each week is going to be the last, and that soon, youxe2x80x99re all going to wake up to the fact that Ixe2x80x99m just some idiot in a basement writing about things Ixe2x80x99m deeply underqualified to write about. A few weeks ago, I went on ConvertKit founder Nathan Barryxe2x80x99s podcast. A writer I really respect reached out after listening and wrote:I'm listening to your podcast with Nathan Barry. The fear of the lack of interesting topics... I literally thought it was just me.Itxe2x80x99s not. I think itxe2x80x99s everyone. The #1 question I get about Not Boring is what my writing process looks like: how do I choose what to write, research, and put out two essays per week. Letxe2x80x99s take the last one first. I was a runner in high school. I didnxe2x80x99t look like a runner -- I was kinda fat -- but I was good. Steve Prefontaine was a hero, and this quote of his is one of my all-time favorites: Ixe2x80x99m writing this on Easter Sunday. Ixe2x80x99ve been up since 7am after sleeping six restless, post-COVID-vaccine hours. Ixe2x80x99m physically and mentally exhausted. But Ixe2x80x99ve been at the computer for eight hours today. I was at the computer eight hours yesterday. I donxe2x80x99t think Ixe2x80x99m smarter than anyone, but I do think I can outwork everyone. I havenxe2x80x99t taken a day off this year other than the two days I had COVID, the four days after Dev was born, and a week around Christmas, including weekends. Seven days a week, 352 of the past 365 days. Thatxe2x80x99s not a brag. I wish I could take time off. It seemed particularly silly when I was making no money on this newsletter and had to turn down socially distanced hangs with friends or dinners with family to write it. I couldnxe2x80x99t be luckier that Puja was so understanding; I donxe2x80x99t know if I would have been. But Ixe2x80x99m genuinely petrified that each week, if I donxe2x80x99t give it everything I have, could be the last week that Not Boring grows. Even just taking those four days off for Devxe2x80x99s birth, growth slowed from a consistent 1,000 new subscribers per week to 400-500 for the next few weeks. This is a momentum game as much as anything. Thatxe2x80x99s what I mean when I say that doing this is neither as impossible or as easy as it seems from the outside. Itxe2x80x99s taken a ton of hard work. Part of the need for hard work comes from my lack of process. I have a running list of topics that I want to write about in Roam, and every week, when I look at it, I realize that I donxe2x80x99t want to write about anything on that list. Instead, I spend a lot of time on Twitter and talking to people to figure out the most interesting companies and things going on that people donxe2x80x99t quite understand, and then I try to understand and translate. For a Monday piece, that typically means figuring out what Ixe2x80x99m going to write about sometime on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, and starting to research. For APIs All the Way Down, I knew that APIs were important, but I didnxe2x80x99t quite understand what made them special. Then Stripe and Shopify announced a deeper partnership and I wanted to figure out why. So to start, I did a couple things: called two people who could point me in the right direction, and then found every article and podcast I could and dove in. Herexe2x80x99s what my Roam looks like: Each gray dot has rows and rows of notes collapsed under them. I try to absorb as much as possible, and try to figure out what the interesting angle is. Sometimes, there isnxe2x80x99t one, and I need to start over. More often than not, I say there isnxe2x80x99t, whine to Puja that Ixe2x80x99m not going to be able to send something out, and then sit in the basement reading and listening until some idea hits. Often, Ixe2x80x99ll try to outline what Ixe2x80x99m going to write about in Google Docs. Most of the time, it looks empty, like this: Ixe2x80x99m not an outline person. Instead, I just start writing. That little chunk about Stripe and Shopify seemed like a good enough hook to start with, so I went with it. This is how I started my draft in Google Docs:And then I just write, get blocked, mess around on Twitter, hang out with Puja and Dev, start writing again, complain that Ixe2x80x99m not going to be able to get it done again. Then I get back in front of the computer, open up Figma to make some graphics and get the creative juices flowing. That helps -- when Ixe2x80x99m stuck writing, Ixe2x80x99ll pull data, make a chart, create an image-- and at some point, I find some bolt of inspiration, some thread to pull on that will take me most of the way through the essay. Once I have a bad draft, I send it to Puja and my brother Dan, (and occasionally to my sister, Meghan, if I really want it shredded) with some variation of this text: Sometimes Puja edits; Dan always edits. Hexe2x80x99s a hero. The thing I love about having my brother as my editor is that hexe2x80x99s not afraid to tell me when something is terrible, and the reason I like Dan specifically as my editor is because he thinks about all of this stuff as much as me and can give input on the content as well as the structure and form. Then I pace nervously while Dan edits. Sometimes he rips them apart, sometimes he tells me theyxe2x80x99re actually good and gives a few copy edits. This is normally Sunday night. Then I read through, make the edits, leave notes for what to do in the morning, and go to sleep. I wake up around 5:30am on Monday, read through with fresh eyes, make more changes, and make any last graphics, like the title image. Then I copy it over from GDoc to Substack, open up Descript, and read the whole thing into the mic for the audio version. Sometimes, I run out of time and need to hit send before finishing the audio version, in which case I send, tweet, and go back to recording. I publish the audio version, go upstairs, and fret over my open rate and how many likes my tweet about the essay got. Then I take a couple hours off and start over for Thursday. Every. Single. Week.  In August, I tweeted that my writing process looks like this: Eight months later, itxe2x80x99s still the same. Itxe2x80x99s a psychological roller coaster. I legitimately think itxe2x80x99s all over every week. That may never change, and I think Not Boring will be OK as long as it doesnxe2x80x99t.Lesson: You should take no lessons from my process other than, xe2x80x9cIf he can do it, I can do it.xe2x80x9dSomehow, despite that process, Not Boring has survived and grown. Growth is one side of the coin, but growth alone doesnxe2x80x99t put food on the table, and itxe2x80x99s an awful lot of work to do for free. So the second goal that I laid out in May 2020 was to start making money: Goal #2: Make Enough Money From the Newsletter to Cover RentWithin the next 6 months, I want to launch a paid version of the newsletter. By this time next year, I want to be making enough from it to cover rent or mortgage payments.The Passion Economy is taking off, enabling thousands to make a living off of what they create. Personally, I love the idea that covering the basics doing something that I love will allow me to take bigger swings elsewhere.At the time, after listening to all of the Substack hype around subscriptions, I assumed that I, too, would charge people to read the newsletter. Ultimately, I decided that was the wrong move for Not Boring. Why? As with everything, therexe2x80x99s not one right answer for everyone. The key is this: your product, growth strategy, and business model need to be connected. Both subscription- and advertising-based models have pros and cons, and make sense for different types of writers:  Subscriptions have pros and cons:Pro: generate predictable cashflowsPro: allow writers to focus on writing quality content for their core audience instead of optimizing for clicks (the argument goes)Pro: subscription-based writers arenxe2x80x99t beholden to their advertisers and can therefore write whatever they want without fear of retributionCon: Harder to grow because content is behind a paywallCon: People will only pay for so many subscriptionsCon: When someone subscribes for a year, you need to write for a year Good for: Topics with a clear focus, especially work-related ones that can be expensedAdvertising does too:Pro: Free content means readers can share and drive growthPro: Makes content more broadly accessible. Another way to look at it is that advertisers are paying for everyonexe2x80x99s subscriptionPro: Writers can experiment and dance around more since people didnxe2x80x99t pay for a particular type of contentPro: OptionalityCon: Need to spend time doing ad sales and writing ad copyCon: Ads take space that people need to read before getting to the meatGood for: More general content with wider appeal For Not Boring, a few of things pushed me over to the sponsorship side, where I happily live to this day. Product/Content. Not Boring is a little all over the place. Itxe2x80x99s not focused on a particular niche. The most successful subscription newsletters are focused: Pomp writes about Bitcoin, Lenny writes about Product Management, Web writes about commerce, Mario writes about tech from idea to IPO, Ian writes about fintech, and Polina writes profiles. A less clear focus means that itxe2x80x99s harder for people to justify expensing Not Boring. Growth. Not Boring grows mainly through word of mouth. Putting the best content behind a paywall means that people canxe2x80x99t share the best stuff. I want as many people as possible to read and share what I write.Math. I did some rough math when I was making the decision, and realized that I could probably make a lot more money over time with sponsorships assuming that keeping the newsletter free meant growing faster. If you want to run the model with your own assumptions: Subscription v. Ads ModelIt turns out that I undershot a little bit. Sponsorships were definitely the right call for Not Boring. But how to find sponsors? First, fake it xe2x80x98til you make it. I did Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) deals with The Hustle and Readwise. I only got paid if I drove results. They were not big money, but they were examples I could point to and say, xe2x80x9cYes yes of course, I have a booming advertiser base.xe2x80x9d Second, rely on a little help from friends. Ankur Nagpal, the founder and CEO of Teachable and a good friend, read Not Boring and said he wanted to sponsor it to promote Teachablexe2x80x99s Share What You Know Summit. Third, put it out into the universe. Puja was infinitely patient with me: seven months pregnant, and married to a free newsletter writer who hadnxe2x80x99t made a dime. She gently suggested that I make a deck and use it to start selling sponsorships. Finally, I listened. I surveyed Not Boring readers to learn more about their backgrounds, professions, and preferences, and with examples of previous sponsorships in hand, put together a rough sponsorship deck. Instead of doing outbound sales, because I hate selling, once I had the deck, I decided to tweet it out into the universe. September 11th 2020The Twitter thread worked: it brought in all of the sponsors for the rest of 2020, including todayxe2x80x99s sponsor, Public, and other Not Boring Sponsors that you know and love. From there, sponsorship has spread, like the newsletter itself, through word of mouth. Today, Not Boring makes money directly in two ways: Top of Newsletter Sponsorships. This is the sponsorship format youxe2x80x99re familiar with from newsletters and media everywhere: 150 words and a logo at the top of the newsletter. I charge a little more for Mondays than Thursdays because Mondays tend to go more viral. I picked rates out of thin air in the beginning, and then upped them at Jacob Donnellyxe2x80x99s suggestion. Ixe2x80x99ve grown rates in line with audience size ever since. Sponsored Deep Dives. A couple times a month, I dedicate a Thursday newsletter to a paid deep dive on some of the startups I think are most fascinating or encapsulate an important trend. The companies Ixe2x80x99ve written about would make a strong venture portfolio: Ramp, MainStreet, Pipe, Masterworks, Fundrise, AltoIRA, UserLeap, and Secureframe, with some more great companies on the way: This format was a risk -- sponsored content can be hit or miss, and people generally have mixed feelings about it. Itxe2x80x99s particularly challenging for me because Ixe2x80x99m so naturally optimistic. When I write a Sponsored Deep Dive, I try to write it in the same way that Ixe2x80x99d write a normal Monday post, but since Ixe2x80x99m being paid, I get feedback that I need to be even more critical about the company than I normally would. (Read how I choose which companies to write about here).Generally, though, these Sponsored Deep Dives get more positive feedback than I was expecting, and give people a behind the scenes look at companies that normally donxe2x80x99t share much information publicly. Theyxe2x80x99re here to stay, and Ixe2x80x99m going to be tweaking and evolving these based on feedback in the coming months. So far, sponsorships have proven to be the right path for Not Boring. After many months of generating no revenue, the business side of Not Boring is starting to pick up steam, and April is set to be the best month yet: Not Boring is going better than I expected and just hit an inflection point, and Ixe2x80x99m incredibly grateful for that. One of the challenges with the newsletter business, though, is that therexe2x80x99s xe2x80x9ckey man risk.xe2x80x9d To a potential buyer or investor, that means that itxe2x80x99s a tough investment, because if I get hit by a bus, the business is dead. Thatxe2x80x99s even tougher for me and my family: if I get hit by a busxe2x80xa6 you get it. That means that even though this is my own business, Ixe2x80x99m still the labor, and we all know that capital makes more money than labor. Fortunately, a happy accident of the decision to stay free is that Not Boringxe2x80x99s increased surface area has opened up new and unexpected opportunities, the most exciting of which is the ability to invest in startups together. Lesson: When your business model, product, and growth strategy align, magic happens. Back in June, my friend Fed Novikov reached out. After some time running the Backyard project at Airbnbxe2x80x99s Samara, he and his brother, Petr, were starting their own company, Apt. Fed and I had discussed the Natively Integrated approach before, and the Novikovs were using it to build their business. He asked if I would be up to write about Apt and why the Natively Integrated approach makes sense for real estate development. I was. We also talked to Jonathan Wasserstrum, who runs a leading AngelList syndicate, and he agreed to syndicate the deal. In July, I wrote the first Not Boring Investment Memo: Apt: The Natively Integrated Developer, and accredited readers were able to invest through Jonathanxe2x80x99s syndicate. It went well, and Fed suggested that I start a syndicate for Not Boring. I hadnxe2x80x99t thought about doing anything venture-related before he suggested it, but agreed there was a compelling opportunity. On one side, I could help founders explain what they do. On the other, I could demystify startup investing, which seemed like a dark art reserved for a chosen few.Just writing about companies is one thing, but putting my money where my mouth is, and giving readers the opportunity to do the same, gave me more skin in the game. Plus, I thought that we could give portfolio companies an early advantage by helping them tell their story to potential customers, employees, and investors.In late July, we launched the Not Boring Syndicate with a memo on Composer. Since then, over 900 Not Boring readers have joined the Syndicate, and together, wexe2x80x99ve invested $1.88 million in fourteen startups: The things that we hoped would happen -- companies can attract customers, employees, and investors -- are actually happening. Plus, having a big group of investors and a loud microphone behind you can tip the scales in foundersxe2x80x99 favor. These tweets from Kaeya, Ben, and Ian, the founders of Swaypay, Composer, and Outfit, are what itxe2x80x99s all about: As an added bonus, the Syndicate has been a fun way to let readers participate and build relationships without launching a traditional community. Michael Batnick wrote about the experience as an LP in Everyone is an Investor. That made my week. Until the day we sent the Apt memo, I never imagined that Not Boring would be able to invest in the companies I write about. Even though I worked at a startup, I was still very much an operator and an outsider. As I hope comes across in my writing, Ixe2x80x99m consistently blown away by the companies people build. I know how hard it is; I failed when I tried to do it myself. This is just the beginning of Not Boring as an investor. More to come on that front very soon xf0x9fx91x80Lesson: More people getting involved in startup investing shifts the balance of power to founders, where it should be. Practically everything good that's happened for Not Boring so far has been a happy accident. For someone who spends so much time writing about strategy, Ixe2x80x99ve put surprisingly little thought into the strategy behind Not Boring. Itxe2x80x99s just a newsletter.  But over the past few months -- I think mainly because Ixe2x80x99m doing something that I genuinely love doing, analyzing companies and telling their stories, so when adjacent opportunities arise, I seize them -- things have started to come together in powerful ways. Not Boring is developing a flywheel. In early March, Jake Singer wrote a piece on Not Boring called Million Dollar Newsletter in his newsletter, The Flywheel. I didnxe2x80x99t want to do the piece originally because I thought I would come across as an asshole for having an essay written on me (Not Boring and I are one in the same, itxe2x80x99s different than a normal company). But here I am 5,000 words into writing about myself, so wexe2x80x99re past asshole level now, and the Not Boring Flywheel is worth exploring. Jake wrote:Packy is a better investor because of his writing, and hexe2x80x99s a better writer because of his investing. You canxe2x80x99t make up a better flywheel even if you tried:I think he nailed it, but I want to give a concrete example of how it works, and how I decide what to do now that itxe2x80x99s spinning. It starts with writing about tech companies and trends. Writing (or podcasting, TikTokking, YouTubing, etcxe2x80xa6) attracts people who are interested in the same things you are, and people are the most important part of all of this. Putting your thoughts out there also repels people who donxe2x80x99t like the way you think -- that helps too, it saves time. Writing essays led me to reconnect with Fed, which led me to write the Apt memo, which led to the Syndicate. Investment memos for the Syndicate showed other startups that I could help tell their story, regardless of whether theyxe2x80x99re raising. Thatxe2x80x99s how Sponsored Deep Dives were born.Working closely with companies on Sponsored Deep Dives has created some of my strongest relationships in tech, led to investment opportunities for the Syndicate, and introductions to more companies to write about and invest in (thanks especially to Nick Abouzeid and Mike Wenner for spreading the word about Not Boring!) They also pay the bills, and give me access to companies building the future, which means I can do this full-time and informs my Monday essays, which kicks the whole thing off again. As the flywheel spins, the audience grows, which gives Not Boring access to new ideas, people, and companies and (hopefully) makes Not Boring more useful to readers, partners, and portfolio companies. As I think about whatxe2x80x99s next for Not Boring, new things need to feed the Flywheel.Lesson: Flywheels work, even if theyxe2x80x99re accidental. I hope Ixe2x80x99ve made this clear throughout, but if I havenxe2x80x99t, let me say it again: I find it incredibly fucking wild that so many of you read the words that I write. I still view this newsletter today as just a bigger version of the little thing it was a year ago with a few friends and random internet people, but I also realize that with more readers comes more responsibility. That said: I am not a journalist. Ixe2x80x99ll never lie and Ixe2x80x99ll always tell the truth, but what I said at the top of the first Not Boring Newsletter remains true today: The only things Ixe2x80x99m not optimistic about are cynics and xe2x80x9cwell, actuallyxe2x80xa6xe2x80x9d people. Itxe2x80x99s easy to dunk. Itxe2x80x99s easy to look smart saying why things arenxe2x80x99t going to work. But those people are not our people. Not Boring is for the optimists, and for the people trying to make crazy things happen. Ixe2x80x99m definitely going to be biased. Ixe2x80x99m going to have the backs of the companies in which we invest, and the companies that support Not Boring. So whatxe2x80x99s next for Not Boring? The answer is, just like a year ago, I have no idea. Unlike a year ago, though, I have 365 days of not knowing, growing, and figuring it out under my belt, and Ixe2x80x99m ecstatic to see where serendipity leads us over the next 365. What I do know is that I unapologetically want Not Boring to be a big business. I want to blur the lines between analyzing, experimenting with, investing in, and promoting the companies and products that I canxe2x80x99t stop thinking about. I want to help companies tell their stories.In the immediate future, there are a few things Ixe2x80x99m incredibly excited about. I canxe2x80x99t share details on two of them quite yet, but one involves investing and the other involves experimenting with some of the Web3 tech Ixe2x80x99ve written about. Both are expressions of Power to the Person. Expect more Twitter Spaces: Spaces Cadets with Austin Rief and The Idea Dinner with Mario Gabriele and Acquiredxe2x80x99s Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal.  Long $TWTR!Ixe2x80x99ll also probably start building a little infrastructure under Not Boring -- a new website, maybe a part-time employee or two (perhaps an EA?) -- just in case I get hit by a bus. Mostly, though, Ixe2x80x99m just going to keep writing and following this thing wherever it takes me. When I asked for questions that my Twitter followers had about Not Boring, Tom Critchlow, one of the first Not Boring subscribers and a great writer himself, replied with this: Hexe2x80x99s right. This has been an entirely iterative process. There have been big ups, and even the littlest down feels like the end of the world, but Ixe2x80x99ve tried to listen to your feedback to move it in the right direction. This only works if wexe2x80x99re all into it. Ixe2x80x99ve gone from having one boss to 42,200. Letxe2x80x99s keep iterating and building this together:What do you want to see from Not Boring?THANK YOUThis is just a newsletter, and I probably spilled way too many words on it, but Ixe2x80x99m bewildered and grateful to have this opportunity.

As someone who writes decently but could probably never muster the discipline to do what you do, I know this can't have been easy.One small, irritating nitpick: Maybe it's because I read this essay a couple of times, but I noticed several minor grammatical errors.  In your quest for perfection, I would suggest you edit perhaps one more time before you have the urge to hit \"Send.\"  Good luck.  I enjoy reading your stuff, though often several weeks after it hits my inbox.  I have about 4-5 tabs of Not Boring columns on my Chrome browser (and several more on Safari on my phone) awaiting reading or re-reading. Congrats on a great first year!

Itxe2x80x99s been a wild week for Not Boring Deep Dive sponsors. Following up on MainStreetxe2x80x99s $60 million Series A a few weeks ago, news came out about two more Deep Divers this week:Ramp: On Monday, The Information reported that Ramp raised $65 million from D1 and others at a $1.1 billion valuation, followed immediately by $50 million from Stripe at a $1.6 billion valuation. When we did the Ramp Deep Dive in December, they had just raised $30 million.Pipe: Yesterday, TechCrunch reported that Pipe raised a fresh round of $150 million funding at a $2 billion valuation. When we talked about Pipe in October, they had raised $66 million total. The bar I use for whether I write a Sponsored Deep Dive on a company is whether I would invest my own money in the company if given the chance (disclosure: I invested a small amount in Ramp, MainStreet, and Pipe after writing about them). You can read more about the Deep Dive selection process here.Todayxe2x80x99s Deep Dive Sponsor, Secureframe is fresh off an $18 million Series A itself. I think thatxe2x80x99s just the beginning. They make companies more secure, and security has never been more critical. (I always tell you how Ixe2x80x99m paid for Deep Dives xe2x80x94 CPA, CPM, or equity. Today is CPM).Letxe2x80x99s get to it. Letxe2x80x99s start with a riddle. What do Ukrainian accounting software, Southwest Airlines, and Secureframe have to do with each other? Any guesses? No? Ixe2x80x99ll give you a clue. Secureframe is security compliance software that companies, from 3-person startups to enterprises, use to automate SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance, complete audits, and continuously monitor their security. Itxe2x80x99s how modern software companies stay safe and compliant with less time, effort, or cost, so they can unlock sales and focus on growing their business. But what does that have to do with Southwest and Ukraine? Read on to find out.Remember the old Southwest Airlines commercial in which a bored employee clicks on an email titled xe2x80x9cSick of your job??xe2x80x9d and infects her whole office? Wanna get away? It actually sums up why cybersecurity is so petrifying: all it takes to take down a system is finding and exploiting the weakest link. One employee opening the wrong file can infect an entire companyxe2x80x99s network; even worse, in an interconnected world in which every company runs on top of a stack of other companiesxe2x80x99 software, one employee ignoring a software update can bring down major companies all around the world. In This is How They Tell Me the World Ends, New York Times cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth recounts the story of the most damaging cyber attack to date: NotPetya. (Wired tells it here if you donxe2x80x99t want to read the whole book). On Wednesday June 27, 2017, the day before Ukrainexe2x80x99s Constitution Day, hospitals, banks, ATMs, power plants, the government, and practically all businesses in the country were hit, seemingly simultaneously, with what appeared to be ransomware. It locked computers, deleted files, and spread at breakneck speed from computer to computer, and company to company. Messing with Ukraine on its Constitution Day had become a Russian hacker pastime -- Ukrainexe2x80x99s neighbor routinely shut off the power or deleted files -- but this was different, more vicious. It was also harder to contain. NotPetya spread via xe2x80x9ctwo exploits working in tandemxe2x80x9d: EternalBlue and Mimikatz (technically, Mimikatz is not an exploit but an application used to take advantage of the EternalBlue exploit). EternalBlue was a backdoor into any unpatched Windows computer, and Mimikatz used those computers to steal passwords and break into others. Together, they preyed on the weakest links. The virus was so hard to contain that it jumped from Ukrainian companies into any company that had an office or even an employee in Ukraine. NotPetya took down systems at: Danish shipping giant Maersk, American pharmaceutical behemoth Merck, FedExxe2x80x99s European subsidiary TNT Express, and even boomeranged back on Russian state oil company Rosneft. Once the virus was unleashed, there was no stopping it. And it started by finding a weak link, or more precisely, a weak Linkos. Linkos Group is a small, family-run Ukrainian software business that makes M.E.Doc, a tax product thatxe2x80x99s like a Ukrainian TurboTax or Quicken. Practically anyone who does business in Ukraine uses M.E.Doc. Thatxe2x80x99s how the Russians got in. According to Wired: In the spring of 2017, unbeknownst to anyone at Linkos Group, Russian military hackers hijacked the companyxe2x80x99s update servers to allow them a hidden back door into the thousands of PCs around the country and the world that have M.E.Doc installed. Then, in June 2017, the saboteurs used that back door to release a piece of malware called NotPetya, their most vicious cyberweapon yet. All told, NotPetya did over $10 billion in damages, according to a White House assessment. Itxe2x80x99s an extreme example, one of the most devastating cyber attacks in history, and a distant one, launched halfway around the world. But the book is chock full of other examples, big and small, of hackers, private and state-sponsored, finding their way into the networks of the largest companies and richest governments. Cyber is the new global battlefield, but unlike traditional warfare, itxe2x80x99s much harder to contain the impact to specified targets, as NotPetya showed. Now, companies are often casualties of war. They fall victim to civilian and state-sponsored hackers alike. All of those hackers are constantly looking, or paying, for a way in. They form a global, multi-billion dollar, public-private market for weak links. OK, did you solve the riddle? If M.E.Doc and the woman in the Southwest Airlines commercial were Secureframe customers, they wouldnxe2x80x99t have unleashed malware on their co-workers or customers.Chances are, your company isnxe2x80x99t going to be the weak link in the next NotPetya. But if youxe2x80x99re building a software company of any size, you need to care about security.In order to sell into enterprises, companies need to prove that theyxe2x80x99re secure. After reading the NotPetya story, the reason why should be clear: enterprises canxe2x80x99t afford to let in weak links. Previously, this prevented smaller companies from selling into larger ones early in their lives. xe2x80x9cBottoms-upxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cproduct-ledxe2x80x9d growth is in part a response to slow enterprise sales cycles, which are slow in part due to each enterprisexe2x80x99s bespoke security compliance requirements, which could take months and tens of thousands of dollars to pass, for each company. Over the past couple of years, though, a standard called SOC 2 has emerged as the de facto security compliance standard. Since SOC 2 is generally accepted as the gold standard, getting SOC 2 certified means that you can sell into large companies much earlier. Thatxe2x80x99s a huge revenue unlock for young companies. SOC 2, the humble security compliance standard, is partially responsible for sky-high early stage valuations.  Today, most software companies are SOC 2 compliant by the time they hit 20-30 employees, with some even getting it when theyxe2x80x99re just three people. In a competitive environment, they canxe2x80x99t afford not to be. If your competitor gets its SOC 2 and you donxe2x80x99t, they have free reign to scoop up large customers while youxe2x80x99re stuck down-market. But even though SOC 2 (and a host of sector-specific standards like PCI, HIPAA, and FedRAMP) level the playing field by eliminating the need for a new security compliance process for each potential customer, the process is still a massive pain. It takes months, tens of thousands of dollars, and an endless back and forth of screenshots and process documentation with auditors.Enter Secureframe.Secureframe makes the whole process faster, cheaper and more effective by integrating with the tools you use to automate the process. Typically, startups spend $25-50k on their SOC 2 compliance process. With Secureframe and all of its automations in place, companies save months of time and 50-70% of the cost of a typical SOC 2 certification. Luckily, standardization doesnxe2x80x99t just make it easier for companies to get certified and sell into large companies, it also makes it possible for startups like Secureframe to build tools that make the whole process faster, cheaper, more painless, and more effective. To understand why that matters, wexe2x80x99ll cover:Security Compliance: Important but Not Top PriorityThe Compliance MazeThe Value of Standards in the Consumerization of EnterpriseWhat Secureframe DoesHow to Win a Nascent, Massive, Competitive MarketThis is How They Tell Me The World SurvivesIf you want to learn a little something about cybersecurity, standards, and competitive dynamics, come with me. Imagine youxe2x80x99re building a B2B SaaS startup, thousands of miles away from Washington, or Moscow. Maybe youxe2x80x99re in Silicon Valley, or Miami. There are two of you. You have an idea, a couple new M1 MacBook Pros, and cases of Red Bull. You just raised a small pre-seed (whatxe2x80x99s that these days, like $5 million?) and ITxe2x80x99S TIME TO BUILD. Itxe2x80x99s easier than ever to build a startup, and harder than ever to stand out. So you mix and match a bunch of off-the-shelf software, plug in Twilio to message customers, Stytch to handle authentication, and Stripe to start taking payments. Security is important to you, obviously, and you read something about NotPetya once, but thatxe2x80x99s not the top priority for now. Startups, youxe2x80x99ve read, are all about ruthless prioritization. So you trust that security is important to the companies that build the software on top of which youxe2x80x99re building. With more plug-and-play back-end tech, youxe2x80x99re content to trust (for now, until you have a bigger team). You spend a lot of your time on your points of differentiation, on the front-end -- designing, testing with customers, re-designing, getting feedback, iterating, re-testing. Uh oh! A competitor just got funded -- a $6 million pre-pre-seed! -- and you need to pick up the pace. You hire a couple of engineers, a lead designer, and a salesperson. Somethingxe2x80x99s working. You have product-market fit! The land grab is ON, and you decide to go upmarket before your competitors do, to start selling to enterprise customers. Everything is moving so fast. And then it slows down. Because your enterprise customer asked you to respond to an RFP or RFI (Request for Proposal / Information) and to include your security compliance certification. Damn. Given the potential attackers lurking around every corner, itxe2x80x99s no surprise that large enterprises and even fast-growing startups need to make sure the software they use is secure. That means understanding the software itself, the software that the software is built on, and the processes that the company itself uses to screen employees, manage permissions, and even undertake performance reviews. Until about a decade ago, each company created its own security compliance hurdles for vendors to jump over. If you wanted to sell into Microsoft, that might mean one set of things, if you wanted to sell into Salesforce, another set of things, and if you wanted to sell into the government, godspeed. As more software moved to the cloud, the AICPA, one of accountingxe2x80x99s governing bodies in the US, developed the Service Organization Controls (SOC) standards, of which there are three (technically, SOC3 is more of a general use report instead of a full fledged standard). SOC 2 is really the only one you need to care about. While an accounting-governing-body-created set of system and organization controls sounds tedious, and it is, itxe2x80x99s also way better than going through a new bespoke process for each potential customer. Instead, you can get your SOC 2 certification and proudly display that on your site and in RFI/RFPs to prove that youxe2x80x99re a trustworthy vendor. SOC 2 tells potential customers that you probably wonxe2x80x99t, accidentally or intentionally, give hackers an open door into their networks, or into their customersxe2x80x99 networks. The AICPA created SOC 2 in 2011, and has iterated on it a few times. After the last iteration in 2017-2018, SOC 2 became the de facto industry standard. SOC 2 is now table stakes. By the time a company hits 20-30 people, theyxe2x80x99ve likely gotten their SOC 2 compliance. Many get it when the company is just the co-founders and a few laptops. Thatxe2x80x99s because not only do large customers require that their vendors have SOC 2, but that their vendorsxe2x80x99 vendors have SOC 2. Itxe2x80x99s SOC 2 all the way down. Getting SOC 2 certified requires companies to do a bunch of things. According to WorkOS, those include: Quality oversight of the company as a whole (performance reviews, independent voices, background checks, etc.)The SDLC (software development lifecycle) is transparent, trackable, and controlled (issue tracking, unit testing, version control, etc.)Your application and underlying infrastructure are secure and monitored (encryption, logging, APM, vulnerability scans, etc.)Youxe2x80x99ve implemented access controls for internal services and SaaS (de-provisioning accounts, 2FA, malware detection, etc.)A lot of these things are best practices anyway; SOC 2 just makes you prove and document everything. First, startups typically get SOC 2 Type I, which is just a snapshot in time, and then get SOC 2 Type II, which is audited over 3-12 months, to satisfy customersxe2x80x99 compliance requirements. Plus, they need to get recertified annually, all signed off on by an auditor. And thatxe2x80x99s just SOC 2. Therexe2x80x99s also ISO 27001, published jointly by the International Organization for Standardisation and the International Electrotechnical Commission, which was recently revised in 2013. ISO 27001 has ~75-85% overlap with SOC 2, but adds on a few information security-specific requirements. If you deal with credit cards, therexe2x80x99s Payment Card Industry (PCI) Standards. Healthcare has the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Federal government has the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which is so onerous -- it takes about two years and $1 million to complete -- that less than 300 vendors are FedRAMP certified. The Department of Defense recently introduced the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), its attempt to make it easier and more accessible to sell software to federal agencies. The average CMMC audit costs $10-30k instead of $1 million. All of that sounds like a ton of work, and it is. It all sounds bad and overly onerous, but itxe2x80x99s not. Standards actually level the playing field and make it possible for companies to sell into enterprises and other startups more quickly and cheaply than ever before. Since the last iteration of SOC 2, itxe2x80x99s become the de facto security compliance certification. That doesnxe2x80x99t mean that all of a sudden, companies who never required any security compliance now require SOC 2 from their vendors; it means that all of the companies that had created their own compliance requirements began accepting SOC 2 instead. SOC 2 is a lot like the Common App in college admissions: do it once, use it in many places, sometimes with a little supplemental work required for specific schools / enterprises. That makes it dramatically easier for small companies to sell into bigger ones. And increasingly, bigger ones are open to that. The xe2x80x9cconsumerization of the enterprisexe2x80x9d refers to the idea that companies are full of people who use smooth, well-designed software in their personal lives, and have come to expect the same at work. In Bill-A-Bear, I highlighted a list of the work software people on Twitter told me they loved the most. With the exception of Excel (which is a whole xe2x80x98nother story), all of peoplesxe2x80x99 favorites are modern, smooth, consumer-like. No one wants to use shitty software all day, and new software is often easier-to-use than old software (people typically build new software startups to replace old, shitty software), but at the same time, enterprises and startups alike need to maintain their procurement standards. If startups want to sell into enterprises earlier, itxe2x80x99s on them to be enterprise-ready sooner.SOC 2 makes that possible more cheaply and easily than was previously possible (as do ISO 27001, CMMC, and the rest). That means that startups are able to land bigger clients, earlier. Much Substack ink has been spilled over high early-stage startup valuations, but some of the valuation increase can be explained by the fact that companies are landing bigger clients at a stage at which they previously would have been limited to selling into other startups. That said, getting compliant is still a painful process. SOC 2 and ISO 27001 mean that you only need to go through one painful process per year, but it can still take tens of thousands of dollars and many months of manual back-and-forth with auditors to get certified. Thatxe2x80x99s where Secureframe comes in. Secureframe helps companies get compliant in weeks rather than months, typically saving customers an average of 50% on their audit costs (which can traditionally run over $50k). Founded by Shrav Mehta and Natasja Nielsen in 2020, Secureframe integrates with over 40 of the most commonly used products companies use to automatically understand their security posture and automate an increasing amount of the security compliance certification process. Maintaining a SOC 2 gets more complex over time. As Secureframe highlights, xe2x80x9cEvery new contractor, employee, customer, and vendor requires more security controls.xe2x80x9d Growth is great, but it makes compliance messier. Thatxe2x80x99s why Secureframe is focused on automating as much of the process as possible. If companies plug in their HR system like Gusto or Justworks, Secureframe knows when a new employee joins. By connecting to a companyxe2x80x99s device management software, like JAMF, Fleetsmith or AirWatch, Secureframe can ensure that devices are secure and accounts are properly controlled. Integrating with cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure gives Secureframe insight into the security of a companyxe2x80x99s infrastructure. Instead of asking employees to regularly screenshot their workflows and emailing them to auditors every week, Secureframe does as much as possible automatically, and provides auditors with detailed reports. Therexe2x80x99s still a lot of manual work in the process, which may hamper Secureframexe2x80x99s ability to scale efficiently -- some because Secureframe needs to hire more engineers and build more integrations, and some because parts of the process are structurally manual. For example, you canxe2x80x99t pull board meeting minutes with a direct integration, but Secureframe lets customers easily upload them instead. The team is hiring aggressively to automate the process as much as possible, and already features three times as many integrations as competitors like Vanta.The approach seems to be working. Secureframe has hundreds of clients and has grown nearly 20x in the past year. Just a couple of weeks ago, it announced an $18 million Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Base10 Partners, Gradient Ventures, Soma Capital, and others, just five months after its $4.5 million Seed round co-led by Gradient and Base10, with participation from Soma Capital, BoxGroup, Village Global, Soma Capital, Liquid2, Chapter One, Worklife Ventures, and Backend Capital.Secureframexe2x80x99s business model is straightforward: itxe2x80x99s a SaaS business, with pricing based on company size and the certifications a company wants to get. Once it wins a customer, itxe2x80x99s incredibly sticky. Setting up all of those integrations takes upfront work, and as long as Secureframe makes the SOC 2 and ISO 27001 processes faster and smoother, companies are unlikely to churn. Quite the opposite, actually: Secureframe should see strong Net Dollar Retention, meaning that each customer spends more every year, for a few reasons: Companies need to recertify every year. In order to continue to sell to large companies, they need to remain compliant, which means they need Secureframe. As companies grow, they pay Secureframe more money. Secureframe will add new standards like PCI, HIPAA, and CMMC, which have overlapping requirements with SOC 2 and ISO 27001. It makes sense to use the same company for all of them. More security compliance certifications means more potential customers for Secureframexe2x80x99s customers. One of their investors told me that xe2x80x9cthe thesis around Secureframe has revolved around them xe2x80x98enabling a new generation of enterprise software companies.xe2x80x99\" Clients like Hasura, Instabase, and Fabric rely on Secureframe to get SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliant earlier so that they can begin selling to large companies, and to maintain their certifications over time. But Secureframe isnxe2x80x99t alone in the security compliance space. How it plans to win is a lesson for other companies in competitive, non-winner-take-all markets.The security compliance market is massive. Just 3-4 years into its life as the gold standard, about 40,000 companies get SOC 2 alone every year, at an average cost of $25,000-$50,000. Thatxe2x80x99s $1-2 billion per year, not counting ISO 27001, PCI, HIPAA, FedRAMP, CMMC, or any number of other security compliance certifications. Secureframe and its competitors believe that as they bring down the cost and effort required to get certified, theyxe2x80x99ll expand the market. Secureframe isnxe2x80x99t the only company that noticed. Companies like Vanta, Laika, and Tugboat Logic also streamline security compliance. Plus, security compliance software is incredibly sticky, not just for Secureframe, but for its competitors. As long as it works as advertised, customers will stick around and grow. That means therexe2x80x99s urgency to win customers early.What do you do to compete and win in this kind of market? First, you build a differentiated product with a superior customer experience. This is the most important part. Secureframe is a relatively new entrant, but itxe2x80x99s the fastest-growing and best-funded for a reason. Secureframe stands out from competitors on a few key dimensions: In-House Compliance. Head of Compliance was the companyxe2x80x99s first hire, and Secureframe has one of the industry's only in-house compliance teams to make sure that customers aren't just checking the box; they're actually secure and implementing the best security practices. There's no worse customer experience than being hacked after you paid to be safe.End-to-End Support. Head of Customer Success was one of the first five hires. Secureframe works with clients all the way through certification, even once theyxe2x80x99ve handed off the process to auditors, and is committed to a smooth customer experience in a space where xe2x80x9csmoothxe2x80x9d isnxe2x80x99t a thing. Most Integrations. Secureframexe2x80x99s industry-leading 40+ integrations (3x as many as Vanta) means less manual work for customers, faster turnaround times, and ongoing systems monitoring.Agentless. Secureframe uses an Agentless approach to get access to customersxe2x80x99 data. Some competitors have customers install agents on their devices, which can be time consuming, difficult to set up, and less secure. You want a security compliance company thatxe2x80x99s the mostxe2x80xa6 secure. Second, you grow really fast and acquire as many customers as possible. This is why Secureframe is sponsoring Not Boring today. Itxe2x80x99s also why I keep hearing about SOC 2 on my favorite podcasts. When I hit play on Invest Like the Best, Patrick is there singing Vantaxe2x80x99s praises, and when I switch over to 20 Minute VC, Harryxe2x80x99s doing the same for Secureframe. Itxe2x80x99s a good old fashioned land grab. Agreement on new standards unleashed a new market, and the rush is on to win customers. Every customer that Secureframe wins is a customer that a competitor canxe2x80x99t. (If youxe2x80x99re reading this, youxe2x80x99re on Team Secureframe. Thatxe2x80x99s the rule. Go sign up!)Secureframe has raised more money than any of its competitors, despite being a newer entrant. Capital isnxe2x80x99t a moat in and of itself, but it can certainly help in a space in which speed is key. Shrav told me about a few other really clever things that Secureframe does to acquire customers, but he swore me to secrecy (for now) because he doesnxe2x80x99t want the competition to pick up his tricks. Third, you build in switching costs so that customers donxe2x80x99t leave once youxe2x80x99ve acquired them. Secureframe does this in two ways:Integrations. Integrations create a better customer experience; they also dig moats. Once a company integrates all of their tools, and everythingxe2x80x99s running smoothly, theyxe2x80x99re less likely to leave and go do it again with a competitor. Soon, Secureframe will open up an integration marketplace so that the companies coming to them today saying, xe2x80x9cWe want to build an integration with Tool Xxe2x80x9d can do it, and open up the integration to other Secureframe customers. This requires being the biggest (see: point 2, grow really fast) so that itxe2x80x99s worth it for companies to build integrations on your platform. If they pull it off, it will give Secureframe platform network effects, like Windows or the App Store. Vendor Management. One of the challenges with security compliance is that you donxe2x80x99t just need to prove that youxe2x80x99re secure, but that the vendors you use are secure too. Itxe2x80x99s all about minimizing weak links. Since a 100 person company uses 50 vendors on average, this process can be a huge headache. Secureframe works with companies to find and upload all of their vendorsxe2x80x99 security compliance certifications, and is building the largest database of vendor security information. In the future, if one company uses AWS and uploads their compliance certifications, the next company that comes in can just pull that off the shelf, saving time and money.  Next, you add more compliance certifications. Secureframe is using its fresh funding to grow beyond SOC 2 and ISO 27001 into PCI, HIPAA, FedRAMP, HITRUST, CMMC and beyond. More certifications can be a deciding factor when comparing Secureframe versus its competitors upfront, and can be a reason for companies to switch from one platform to another despite high switching costs. Since itxe2x80x99s mainly a software business with most costs going to engineering, sales, and customer success, Secureframe has massive margins. It can spend to acquire customers, and spend on R&D to make sure that it has the products it needs to keep them happy and grow their business. Secureframe isnxe2x80x99t constrained by capital, itxe2x80x99s constrained by its ability to hire and execute. And it doesnxe2x80x99t need to win the whole market. With market dynamics like these, competition can actually be a good thing. The industry only coalesced around SOC 2 as the standard a few years ago, and the competitors are sharing the cost and effort of getting the word out. I was more receptive to Secureframe after hearing a Vanta ad, and likewise, potential customers might be more receptive to Vanta after hearing a Secureframe ad (or reading this piece) (but seriously, use Secureframe).Ultimately, though, what itxe2x80x99s really about is making companies, and the internet broadly, more secure. The biggest risk to any competitor, including Secureframe, is that one of its customers gets breached. Itxe2x80x99s a reputational landmine, and given the interconnectedness of the system, a potential security threat to many customers. Thatxe2x80x99s why Secureframe is building more than a xe2x80x9ccheck the boxxe2x80x9d product. Itxe2x80x99s great that SOC 2 lets companies sell to more customers, but the real goal is to actually secure them. Secureframexe2x80x99s mission is to secure the internet and help businesses trust their vendors. If Secureframe is maximally successful, there wonxe2x80x99t be another NotPetya. Today, that means making it as easy as possible for customers to get their SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications. Plus, its compliance team already provides recommendations on best practices that go beyond certifications. Tomorrow, itxe2x80x99s adding more certifications. But certifications meet the basic requirements, and Secureframe thinks that therexe2x80x99s so much more companies can do to secure themselves and their customers. As Secureframe reviews more vendors and assesses their risk, it can help all its customers better manage their own risk. It can recommend vendors based not just on their certifications, but on what Secureframe knows about their security practices more broadly. And as each new vendor comes on, Secureframe can automate and speed up the process for everyone else. Beyond that, Secureframe is working towards building its own standard, drawing best practices from existing standards and from the vendors and customers that work with Secureframe. Combining its own standard with the worldxe2x80x99s largest database would give Secureframe the holy grail: the ability to set a higher bar that actually makes the internet secure and make the bar easier, faster, and cheaper to clear so that companies can focus on what they do best.SOC 2 compliancexe2x80xa6 not as boring as it sounds, huh? If you want to learn more about getting compliant and securing your business, schedule a call with the Secureframe team. Schedule a Demo with SecureframeDonxe2x80x99t be the weakest link.

Itxe2x80x99s been a wild week for Not Boring Deep Dive sponsors. Following up on MainStreetxe2x80x99s $60 million Series A a few weeks ago, news came out about two more Deep Divers this week:Ramp: On Monday, The Information reported that Ramp raised $65 million from D1 and others at a $1.1 billion valuation, followed immediately by $50 million from Stripe at a $1.6 billion valuation. When we did the Ramp Deep Dive in December, they had just raised $30 million.Pipe: Yesterday, TechCrunch reported that Pipe raised a fresh round of $150 million funding at a $2 billion valuation. When we talked about Pipe in October, they had raised $66 million total. The bar I use for whether I write a Sponsored Deep Dive on a company is whether I would invest my own money in the company if given the chance (disclosure: I invested a small amount in Ramp, MainStreet, and Pipe after writing about them). You can read more about the Deep Dive selection process here.Todayxe2x80x99s Deep Dive Sponsor, Secureframe is fresh off an $18 million Series A itself. I think thatxe2x80x99s just the beginning. They make companies more secure at a time when security has never been more critical, and are competing smartly in a massive market.(I always tell you how Ixe2x80x99m paid for Deep Dives xe2x80x94 CPA, CPM, or equity. Today is CPM).Letxe2x80x99s get to it. Letxe2x80x99s start with a riddle. What do Ukrainian accounting software, Southwest Airlines, and Secureframe have to do with each other? Any guesses? No? Ixe2x80x99ll give you a clue. Secureframe is security compliance software that companies, from 3-person startups to enterprises, use to automate SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance, complete audits, and continuously monitor their security. Itxe2x80x99s how modern software companies stay safe and compliant with less time, effort, or cost, so they can unlock sales and focus on growing their business. But what does that have to do with Southwest and Ukraine? Read on to find out.Remember the old Southwest Airlines commercial in which a bored employee clicks on an email titled xe2x80x9cSick of your job??xe2x80x9d and infects her whole office? Wanna get away? It actually sums up why cybersecurity is so petrifying: all it takes to take down a system is finding and exploiting the weakest link. One employee opening the wrong file can infect an entire companyxe2x80x99s network; even worse, in an interconnected world in which every company runs on top of a stack of other companiesxe2x80x99 software, one employee ignoring a software update can bring down major companies all around the world. In This is How They Tell Me the World Ends, New York Times cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth recounts the story of the most damaging cyber attack to date: NotPetya. (Wired tells it here if you donxe2x80x99t want to read the whole book). On Wednesday June 27, 2017, the day before Ukrainexe2x80x99s Constitution Day, hospitals, banks, ATMs, power plants, the government, and practically all businesses in the country were hit, seemingly simultaneously, with what appeared to be ransomware. It locked computers, deleted files, and spread at breakneck speed from computer to computer, and company to company. Messing with Ukraine on its Constitution Day had become a Russian hacker pastime -- Ukrainexe2x80x99s neighbor routinely shut off the power or deleted files -- but this was different, more vicious. It was also harder to contain. NotPetya spread via xe2x80x9ctwo exploits working in tandemxe2x80x9d: EternalBlue and Mimikatz (technically, Mimikatz is not an exploit but an application used to take advantage of the EternalBlue exploit). EternalBlue was a backdoor into any unpatched Windows computer, and Mimikatz used those computers to steal passwords and break into others. Together, they preyed on the weakest links. The virus was so hard to contain that it jumped from Ukrainian companies into any company that had an office or even an employee in Ukraine. NotPetya took down systems at: Danish shipping giant Maersk, American pharmaceutical behemoth Merck, FedExxe2x80x99s European subsidiary TNT Express, and even boomeranged back on Russian state oil company Rosneft. Once the virus was unleashed, there was no stopping it. And it started by finding a weak link, or more precisely, a weak Linkos. Linkos Group is a small, family-run Ukrainian software business that makes M.E.Doc, a tax product thatxe2x80x99s like a Ukrainian TurboTax or Quicken. Practically anyone who does business in Ukraine uses M.E.Doc. Thatxe2x80x99s how the Russians got in. According to Wired: In the spring of 2017, unbeknownst to anyone at Linkos Group, Russian military hackers hijacked the companyxe2x80x99s update servers to allow them a hidden back door into the thousands of PCs around the country and the world that have M.E.Doc installed. Then, in June 2017, the saboteurs used that back door to release a piece of malware called NotPetya, their most vicious cyberweapon yet. All told, NotPetya did over $10 billion in damages, according to a White House assessment. Itxe2x80x99s an extreme example, one of the most devastating cyber attacks in history, and a distant one, launched halfway around the world. But the book is chock full of other examples, big and small, of hackers, private and state-sponsored, finding their way into the networks of the largest companies and richest governments. Cyber is the new global battlefield, but unlike traditional warfare, itxe2x80x99s much harder to contain the impact to specified targets, as NotPetya showed. Now, companies are often casualties of war. They fall victim to civilian and state-sponsored hackers alike. All of those hackers are constantly looking, or paying, for a way in. They form a global, multi-billion dollar, public-private market for weak links. OK, did you solve the riddle? If M.E.Doc and the woman in the Southwest Airlines commercial were Secureframe customers, they wouldnxe2x80x99t have unleashed malware on their co-workers or customers.Chances are, your company isnxe2x80x99t going to be the weak link in the next NotPetya. But if youxe2x80x99re building a software company of any size, you need to care about security.In order to sell into enterprises, companies need to prove that theyxe2x80x99re secure. After reading the NotPetya story, the reason why should be clear: enterprises canxe2x80x99t afford to let in weak links. Previously, this prevented smaller companies from selling into larger ones early in their lives. xe2x80x9cBottoms-upxe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cproduct-ledxe2x80x9d growth is in part a response to slow enterprise sales cycles, which are slow in part due to each enterprisexe2x80x99s bespoke security compliance requirements, which could take months and tens of thousands of dollars to pass, for each company. Over the past couple of years, though, a standard called SOC 2 has emerged as the de facto security compliance standard. Since SOC 2 is generally accepted as the gold standard, getting SOC 2 certified means that you can sell into large companies much earlier. Thatxe2x80x99s a huge revenue unlock for young companies. SOC 2, the humble security compliance standard, is partially responsible for sky-high early stage valuations.  Today, most software companies are SOC 2 compliant by the time they hit 20-30 employees, with some even getting it when theyxe2x80x99re just three people. In a competitive environment, they canxe2x80x99t afford not to be. If your competitor gets its SOC 2 and you donxe2x80x99t, they have free reign to scoop up large customers while youxe2x80x99re stuck down-market. But even though SOC 2 (and a host of sector-specific standards like PCI, HIPAA, and FedRAMP) level the playing field by eliminating the need for a new security compliance process for each potential customer, the process is still a massive pain. It takes months, tens of thousands of dollars, and an endless back and forth of screenshots and process documentation with auditors.Enter Secureframe.Secureframe makes the whole process faster, cheaper and more effective by integrating with the tools you use to automate the process. Typically, startups spend $25-50k on their SOC 2 compliance process. With Secureframe and all of its automations in place, companies save months of time and 50-70% of the cost of a typical SOC 2 certification. Luckily, standardization doesnxe2x80x99t just make it easier for companies to get certified and sell into large companies, it also makes it possible for startups like Secureframe to build tools that make the whole process faster, cheaper, more painless, and more effective. To understand why that matters, wexe2x80x99ll cover:Security Compliance: Important but Not Top PriorityThe Compliance MazeThe Value of Standards in the Consumerization of EnterpriseWhat Secureframe DoesHow to Win a Nascent, Massive, Competitive MarketThis is How They Tell Me The World SurvivesIf you want to learn a little something about cybersecurity, standards, and competitive dynamics, come with me. Imagine youxe2x80x99re building a B2B SaaS startup, thousands of miles away from Washington, or Moscow. Maybe youxe2x80x99re in Silicon Valley, or Miami. There are two of you. You have an idea, a couple new M1 MacBook Pros, and cases of Red Bull. You just raised a small pre-seed (whatxe2x80x99s that these days, like $5 million?) and ITxe2x80x99S TIME TO BUILD. Itxe2x80x99s easier than ever to build a startup, and harder than ever to stand out. So you mix and match a bunch of off-the-shelf software, plug in Twilio to message customers, Stytch to handle authentication, and Stripe to start taking payments. Security is important to you, obviously, and you read something about NotPetya once, but thatxe2x80x99s not the top priority for now. Startups, youxe2x80x99ve read, are all about ruthless prioritization. So you trust that security is important to the companies that build the software on top of which youxe2x80x99re building. With more plug-and-play back-end tech, youxe2x80x99re content to trust (for now, until you have a bigger team). You spend a lot of your time on your points of differentiation, on the front-end -- designing, testing with customers, re-designing, getting feedback, iterating, re-testing. Uh oh! A competitor just got funded -- a $6 million pre-pre-seed! -- and you need to pick up the pace. You hire a couple of engineers, a lead designer, and a salesperson. Somethingxe2x80x99s working. You have product-market fit! The land grab is ON, and you decide to go upmarket before your competitors do, to start selling to enterprise customers. Everything is moving so fast. And then it slows down. Because your enterprise customer asked you to respond to an RFP or RFI (Request for Proposal / Information) and to include your security compliance certification. Damn. Given the potential attackers lurking around every corner, itxe2x80x99s no surprise that large enterprises and even fast-growing startups need to make sure the software they use is secure. That means understanding the software itself, the software that the software is built on, and the processes that the company itself uses to screen employees, manage permissions, and even undertake performance reviews. Until about a decade ago, each company created its own security compliance hurdles for vendors to jump over. If you wanted to sell into Microsoft, that might mean one set of things, if you wanted to sell into Salesforce, another set of things, and if you wanted to sell into the government, godspeed. As more software moved to the cloud, the AICPA, one of accountingxe2x80x99s governing bodies in the US, developed the Service Organization Controls (SOC) standards, of which there are three (technically, SOC3 is more of a general use report instead of a full fledged standard). SOC 2 is really the only one you need to care about. While an accounting-governing-body-created set of system and organization controls sounds tedious, and it is, itxe2x80x99s also way better than going through a new bespoke process for each potential customer. Instead, you can get your SOC 2 certification and proudly display that on your site and in RFI/RFPs to prove that youxe2x80x99re a trustworthy vendor. SOC 2 tells potential customers that you probably wonxe2x80x99t, accidentally or intentionally, give hackers an open door into their networks, or into their customersxe2x80x99 networks. The AICPA created SOC 2 in 2011, and has iterated on it a few times. After the last iteration in 2017-2018, SOC 2 became the de facto industry standard. SOC 2 is now table stakes. By the time a company hits 20-30 people, theyxe2x80x99ve likely gotten their SOC 2 compliance. Many get it when the company is just the co-founders and a few laptops. Thatxe2x80x99s because not only do large customers require that their vendors have SOC 2, but that their vendorsxe2x80x99 vendors have SOC 2. Itxe2x80x99s SOC 2 all the way down. Getting SOC 2 certified requires companies to do a bunch of things. According to WorkOS, those include: Quality oversight of the company as a whole (performance reviews, independent voices, background checks, etc.)The SDLC (software development lifecycle) is transparent, trackable, and controlled (issue tracking, unit testing, version control, etc.)Your application and underlying infrastructure are secure and monitored (encryption, logging, APM, vulnerability scans, etc.)Youxe2x80x99ve implemented access controls for internal services and SaaS (de-provisioning accounts, 2FA, malware detection, etc.)A lot of these things are best practices anyway; SOC 2 just makes you prove and document everything. First, startups typically get SOC 2 Type I, which is just a snapshot in time, and then get SOC 2 Type II, which is audited over 3-12 months, to satisfy customersxe2x80x99 compliance requirements. Plus, they need to get recertified annually, all signed off on by an auditor. And thatxe2x80x99s just SOC 2. Therexe2x80x99s also ISO 27001, published jointly by the International Organization for Standardisation and the International Electrotechnical Commission, which was recently revised in 2013. ISO 27001 has ~75-85% overlap with SOC 2, but adds on a few information security-specific requirements. If you deal with credit cards, therexe2x80x99s Payment Card Industry (PCI) Standards. Healthcare has the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Federal government has the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which is so onerous -- it takes about two years and $1 million to complete -- that less than 300 vendors are FedRAMP certified. The Department of Defense recently introduced the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), its attempt to make it easier and more accessible to sell software to federal agencies. The average CMMC audit costs $10-30k instead of $1 million. All of that sounds like a ton of work, and it is. It all sounds bad and overly onerous, but itxe2x80x99s not. Standards actually level the playing field and make it possible for companies to sell into enterprises and other startups more quickly and cheaply than ever before. Since the last iteration of SOC 2, itxe2x80x99s become the de facto security compliance certification. That doesnxe2x80x99t mean that all of a sudden, companies who never required any security compliance now require SOC 2 from their vendors; it means that all of the companies that had created their own compliance requirements began accepting SOC 2 instead. SOC 2 is a lot like the Common App in college admissions: do it once, use it in many places, sometimes with a little supplemental work required for specific schools / enterprises. That makes it dramatically easier for small companies to sell into bigger ones. And increasingly, bigger ones are open to that. The xe2x80x9cconsumerization of the enterprisexe2x80x9d refers to the idea that companies are full of people who use smooth, well-designed software in their personal lives, and have come to expect the same at work. In Bill-A-Bear, I highlighted a list of the work software people on Twitter told me they loved the most. With the exception of Excel (which is a whole xe2x80x98nother story), all of peoplesxe2x80x99 favorites are modern, smooth, consumer-like. No one wants to use shitty software all day, and new software is often easier-to-use than old software (people typically build new software startups to replace old, shitty software), but at the same time, enterprises and startups alike need to maintain their procurement standards. If startups want to sell into enterprises earlier, itxe2x80x99s on them to be enterprise-ready sooner.SOC 2 makes that possible more cheaply and easily than was previously possible (as do ISO 27001, CMMC, and the rest). That means that startups are able to land bigger clients, earlier. Much Substack ink has been spilled over high early-stage startup valuations, but some of the valuation increase can be explained by the fact that companies are landing bigger clients at a stage at which they previously would have been limited to selling into other startups. That said, getting compliant is still a painful process. SOC 2 and ISO 27001 mean that you only need to go through one painful process per year, but it can still take tens of thousands of dollars and many months of manual back-and-forth with auditors to get certified. Thatxe2x80x99s where Secureframe comes in. Secureframe helps companies get compliant in weeks rather than months, typically saving customers an average of 50% on their audit costs (which can traditionally run over $50k). Founded by Shrav Mehta and Natasja Nielsen in 2020, Secureframe integrates with over 40 of the most commonly used products companies use to automatically understand their security posture and automate an increasing amount of the security compliance certification process. Maintaining a SOC 2 gets more complex over time. As Secureframe highlights, xe2x80x9cEvery new contractor, employee, customer, and vendor requires more security controls.xe2x80x9d Growth is great, but it makes compliance messier. Thatxe2x80x99s why Secureframe is focused on automating as much of the process as possible. If companies plug in their HR system like Gusto or Justworks, Secureframe knows when a new employee joins. By connecting to a companyxe2x80x99s device management software, like JAMF, Fleetsmith or AirWatch, Secureframe can ensure that devices are secure and accounts are properly controlled. Integrating with cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure gives Secureframe insight into the security of a companyxe2x80x99s infrastructure. Instead of asking employees to regularly screenshot their workflows and emailing them to auditors every week, Secureframe does as much as possible automatically, and provides auditors with detailed reports. Therexe2x80x99s still a lot of manual work in the process, which may hamper Secureframexe2x80x99s ability to scale efficiently -- some because Secureframe needs to hire more engineers and build more integrations, and some because parts of the process are structurally manual. For example, you canxe2x80x99t pull board meeting minutes with a direct integration, but Secureframe lets customers easily upload them instead. The team is hiring aggressively to automate the process as much as possible, and already features three times as many integrations as competitors like Vanta.The approach seems to be working. Secureframe has hundreds of clients and has grown nearly 20x in the past year. Just a couple of weeks ago, it announced an $18 million Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Base10 Partners, Gradient Ventures, Soma Capital, and others, just five months after its $4.5 million Seed round co-led by Gradient and Base10, with participation from Soma Capital, BoxGroup, Village Global, Soma Capital, Liquid2, Chapter One, Worklife Ventures, and Backend Capital.Secureframexe2x80x99s business model is straightforward: itxe2x80x99s a SaaS business, with pricing based on company size and the certifications a company wants to get. Once it wins a customer, itxe2x80x99s incredibly sticky. Setting up all of those integrations takes upfront work, and as long as Secureframe makes the SOC 2 and ISO 27001 processes faster and smoother, companies are unlikely to churn. Quite the opposite, actually: Secureframe should see strong Net Dollar Retention, meaning that each customer spends more every year, for a few reasons: Companies need to recertify every year. In order to continue to sell to large companies, they need to remain compliant, which means they need Secureframe. As companies grow, they pay Secureframe more money. Secureframe will add new standards like PCI, HIPAA, and CMMC, which have overlapping requirements with SOC 2 and ISO 27001. It makes sense to use the same company for all of them. More security compliance certifications means more potential customers for Secureframexe2x80x99s customers. One of their investors told me that xe2x80x9cthe thesis around Secureframe has revolved around them xe2x80x98enabling a new generation of enterprise software companies.xe2x80x99\" Clients like Hasura, Instabase, and Fabric rely on Secureframe to get SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliant earlier so that they can begin selling to large companies, and to maintain their certifications over time. But Secureframe isnxe2x80x99t alone in the security compliance space. How it plans to win is a lesson for other companies in competitive, non-winner-take-all markets.The security compliance market is massive. Just 3-4 years into its life as the gold standard, about 40,000 companies get SOC 2 alone every year, at an average cost of $25,000-$50,000. Thatxe2x80x99s $1-2 billion per year, not counting ISO 27001, PCI, HIPAA, FedRAMP, CMMC, or any number of other security compliance certifications. Secureframe and its competitors believe that as they bring down the cost and effort required to get certified, theyxe2x80x99ll expand the market. Secureframe isnxe2x80x99t the only company that noticed. Companies like Vanta, Laika, and Tugboat Logic also streamline security compliance. Plus, security compliance software is incredibly sticky, not just for Secureframe, but for its competitors. As long as it works as advertised, customers will stick around and grow. That means therexe2x80x99s urgency to win customers early.What do you do to compete and win in this kind of market? First, you build a differentiated product with a superior customer experience. This is the most important part. Secureframe is a relatively new entrant, but itxe2x80x99s the fastest-growing and best-funded for a reason. Secureframe stands out from competitors on a few key dimensions: In-House Compliance. Head of Compliance was the companyxe2x80x99s first hire, and Secureframe has one of the industry's only in-house compliance teams to make sure that customers aren't just checking the box; they're actually secure and implementing the best security practices. There's no worse customer experience than being hacked after you paid to be safe.End-to-End Support. Head of Customer Success was one of the first five hires. Secureframe works with clients all the way through certification, even once theyxe2x80x99ve handed off the process to auditors, and is committed to a smooth customer experience in a space where xe2x80x9csmoothxe2x80x9d isnxe2x80x99t a thing. Most Integrations. Secureframexe2x80x99s industry-leading 40+ integrations (3x as many as Vanta) means less manual work for customers, faster turnaround times, and ongoing systems monitoring.Agentless. Secureframe uses an Agentless approach to get access to customersxe2x80x99 data. Some competitors have customers install agents on their devices, which can be time consuming, difficult to set up, and less secure. You want a security compliance company thatxe2x80x99s the mostxe2x80xa6 secure. Second, you grow really fast and acquire as many customers as possible. This is why Secureframe is sponsoring Not Boring today. Itxe2x80x99s also why I keep hearing about SOC 2 on my favorite podcasts. When I hit play on Invest Like the Best, Patrick is there singing Vantaxe2x80x99s praises, and when I switch over to 20 Minute VC, Harryxe2x80x99s doing the same for Secureframe. Itxe2x80x99s a good old fashioned land grab. Agreement on new standards unleashed a new market, and the rush is on to win customers. Every customer that Secureframe wins is a customer that a competitor canxe2x80x99t. (If youxe2x80x99re reading this, youxe2x80x99re on Team Secureframe. Thatxe2x80x99s the rule. Go sign up!)Secureframe has raised more money than any of its competitors, despite being a newer entrant. Capital isnxe2x80x99t a moat in and of itself, but it can certainly help in a space in which speed is key. Shrav told me about a few other really clever things that Secureframe does to acquire customers, but he swore me to secrecy (for now) because he doesnxe2x80x99t want the competition to pick up his tricks. Third, you build in switching costs so that customers donxe2x80x99t leave once youxe2x80x99ve acquired them. Secureframe does this in two ways:Integrations. Integrations create a better customer experience; they also dig moats. Once a company integrates all of their tools, and everythingxe2x80x99s running smoothly, theyxe2x80x99re less likely to leave and go do it again with a competitor. Soon, Secureframe will open up an integration marketplace so that the companies coming to them today saying, xe2x80x9cWe want to build an integration with Tool Xxe2x80x9d can do it, and open up the integration to other Secureframe customers. This requires being the biggest (see: point 2, grow really fast) so that itxe2x80x99s worth it for companies to build integrations on your platform. If they pull it off, it will give Secureframe platform network effects, like Windows or the App Store. Vendor Management. One of the challenges with security compliance is that you donxe2x80x99t just need to prove that youxe2x80x99re secure, but that the vendors you use are secure too. Itxe2x80x99s all about minimizing weak links. Since a 100 person company uses 50 vendors on average, this process can be a huge headache. Secureframe works with companies to find and upload all of their vendorsxe2x80x99 security compliance certifications, and is building the largest database of vendor security information. In the future, if one company uses AWS and uploads their compliance certifications, the next company that comes in can just pull that off the shelf, saving time and money.  Next, you add more compliance certifications. Secureframe is using its fresh funding to grow beyond SOC 2 and ISO 27001 into PCI, HIPAA, FedRAMP, HITRUST, CMMC and beyond. More certifications can be a deciding factor when comparing Secureframe versus its competitors upfront, and can be a reason for companies to switch from one platform to another despite high switching costs. Since itxe2x80x99s mainly a software business with most costs going to engineering, sales, and customer success, Secureframe has massive margins. It can spend to acquire customers, and spend on R&D to make sure that it has the products it needs to keep them happy and grow their business. Secureframe isnxe2x80x99t constrained by capital, itxe2x80x99s constrained by its ability to hire and execute. And it doesnxe2x80x99t need to win the whole market. With market dynamics like these, competition can actually be a good thing. The industry only coalesced around SOC 2 as the standard a few years ago, and the competitors are sharing the cost and effort of getting the word out. I was more receptive to Secureframe after hearing a Vanta ad, and likewise, potential customers might be more receptive to Vanta after hearing a Secureframe ad (or reading this piece) (but seriously, use Secureframe).Ultimately, though, what itxe2x80x99s really about is making companies, and the internet broadly, more secure. The biggest risk to any competitor, including Secureframe, is that one of its customers gets breached. Itxe2x80x99s a reputational landmine, and given the interconnectedness of the system, a potential security threat to many customers. Thatxe2x80x99s why Secureframe is building more than a xe2x80x9ccheck the boxxe2x80x9d product. Itxe2x80x99s great that SOC 2 lets companies sell to more customers, but the real goal is to actually secure them. Secureframexe2x80x99s mission is to secure the internet and help businesses trust their vendors. If Secureframe is maximally successful, there wonxe2x80x99t be another NotPetya. Today, that means making it as easy as possible for customers to get their SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications. Plus, its compliance team already provides recommendations on best practices that go beyond certifications. Tomorrow, itxe2x80x99s adding more certifications. But certifications meet the basic requirements, and Secureframe thinks that therexe2x80x99s so much more companies can do to secure themselves and their customers. As Secureframe reviews more vendors and assesses their risk, it can help all its customers better manage their own risk. It can recommend vendors based not just on their certifications, but on what Secureframe knows about their security practices more broadly. And as each new vendor comes on, Secureframe can automate and speed up the process for everyone else. Beyond that, Secureframe is working towards building its own standard, drawing best practices from existing standards and from the vendors and customers that work with Secureframe. Combining its own standard with the worldxe2x80x99s largest database would give Secureframe the holy grail: the ability to set a higher bar that actually makes the internet secure and make the bar easier, faster, and cheaper to clear so that companies can focus on what they do best.SOC 2 compliancexe2x80xa6 not as boring as it sounds, huh? If you want to learn more about getting compliant and securing your business, schedule a call with the Secureframe team. Schedule a Demo with SecureframeDonxe2x80x99t be the weakest link.

We were responsible for finding and negotiating leases on office spaces that we would design, build, and rent out to clients for shorter time periods. As we moved upmarket (longer rentals in bigger spaces), we increasingly competed with WeWork for both spaces and clients. It sucked.Every space we looked at, WeWork looked at. For a space that would typically cost $65/sf, they would offer $70/sf. When brokers brought WeWork potential customers, they would pay up to 100% of one yearxe2x80x99s rent as a commission. If a customer asked for an expensive buildout, they would do it. Different WeWork locations would even compete with each other for the same customer by offering lower prices.We ran our underwriting model to understand if we could do the same things that they could to acquire spaces or customers, and we couldnxe2x80x99t figure out how to make the numbers work. Because they didnxe2x80x99t. And they didnxe2x80x99t have to. Because WeWork was backed by SoftBank. Dunking on SoftBank became de rigueur when the market realized what all of us in the industry already knew - that WeWorkxe2x80x99s unit economics were terrible because they were trying to use capital as their moat. And it wasnxe2x80x99t just WeWork. Wag. Brandless. Katerra. Uber. Compass. Bloomberg called SoftBank xe2x80x9cthe Pied Piper of Unicornsxe2x80x9d as it lured startups to giant pools of money in which they drowned.After WeWorkxe2x80x99s downfall, the man behind the madness, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, or Masa, admitted that maybe hexe2x80x99d made some mistakes. He feigned contrition. Along with the companyxe2x80x99s first quarterly earnings loss in 14 years last November, Son told investors, xe2x80x9cMy investment judgment was poor in many ways and I am reflecting on that.xe2x80x9d And it kinda seemed like he meant it. Masa and SoftBank have stayed relatively quiet by their standards. It announced that it would unload more than $50 billion of legacy assets including stakes in T-Mobile US, Alibaba, and its own Japanese telecom business to shore up its balance sheet and buy back shares. Conservative move. Nice. The market bought it. SoftBank shares recovered from the 2,687xc2xa5 ($25.25) level post-earnings loss in November to as high as 6,932xc2xa5 ($65.16) in late August. Then last Friday, the FT dropped a bomb. Masa and his team of profligate spenders were behind the massive runup and subsequent crash in tech stocks. The Son of a bitch had done it again. After I wrote about Stripe last week, one of my favorite anonymous alt accounts on Twitter goaded me:September 1st 2020My brain doesnxe2x80x99t normally work like that. Ixe2x80x99m an optimist. But when I saw that SoftBank was behind the public market tech pump and dump, I knew I had my target. Itxe2x80x99s easy to look at SoftBankxe2x80x99s moves and think, xe2x80x9cFuck these guys,xe2x80x9d particularly after my experience competing against WeWork. That was my first reaction when the news dropped. SoftBank distorts the markets it plays in. It has had some spectacular private market blowups. And now, itxe2x80x99s messing up the public markets, too.Because SoftBank is so nakedly ambitious and takes such big swings, itxe2x80x99s extremely polarizing. Most recently, SoftBankxe2x80x99s Vision Fund went from xe2x80x9cThis is going to change the worldxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9cTheyxe2x80x99re ruining venture capitalxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9cSee! This guy is an idiotxe2x80x9d in the blink of an eye. As a result, therexe2x80x99s not a lot of nuance in the conversation around the company. Thatxe2x80x99s what Ixe2x80x99ll try to bring today, by covering the three ways to look at SoftBank: Bullish: Masa has a vision that no one fully appreciates and trades at a discountNeutral: Masa is Lennie from Of Mice and Men for Tech Companies (Ixe2x80x99ll explain)Bearish: Masa is just a WallStreetBets Trader with a lot of other peoplexe2x80x99s moneySoftBank is a reflection of its founder. Masa is optimistic and hyperbolic. He is a mix of finance and technology, but is much better suited towards the latter and gets himself in trouble (with a couple of very notable exceptions) when he goes too far towards the former. In a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, at a time when both menxe2x80x99s reputations were cleaner than they are today, Masayoshi Son compared himself to Steve Jobs. xe2x80x9cIf Steve is art and technology,xe2x80x9d he said, xe2x80x9cI am finance and technology.xe2x80x9d  Masaxe2x80x99s history, and SoftBankxe2x80x99s, is a decades-long progression from one end of that spectrum to the other. The further it veers from technology into finance, the riskier it becomes. Masa often sees only the upside while ignoring downside risk - a valuable characteristic in a technology entrepreneur and a liability in a financier. Itxe2x80x99s easy to root against Masa without knowing his story, but hard to root against him once you do. Born in a fishing village in Japan in 1957 to a family of Korean immigrants, at a time when being an immigrant in Japan was not a good place to start, Masayoshi Son came into the world with a chip on his shoulder. The Japanese government forced Sonxe2x80x99s family to change its surname to a Japanese one, Yasumoto. Masayoshi hated it. Luckily, he was gifted enough to make his own name for himself.When he was sixteen, Masa cold called the founder and president of McDonaldxe2x80x99s Japan, and receiving no response, flew to Tokyo and sat in the manxe2x80x99s reception area until he gave in and agreed to meet with the precocious teenager. During those fifteen minutes, he gave Masa two pieces of advice: Learn English. Study computer science. Ever impatient, Masa moved to the US that same year. He dispensed with high school quickly.I went to school at Serramonte High School. I had spent three months in Japan as a freshman in high school, so I entered Serramonte High School as a sophomore. After one week, I was promoted to a junior. After three or four days as a junior, I was promoted to a senior. I was a senior for another three or four days, then I took an exam and graduated. The result was that I finished high school in the United States in two weeks. Then I went to Holy Names College for my freshman and sophomore years before transferring to Berkeley.Wanna guess what he studied at Berkeley? Economics and Computer Science. There it is: Finance and Technology. He started his career on the tech side of the spectrum.While at school, he patented an electronic translator with a professor, Forrest Mozer, and sold the patent to Sharp for around $1 million within a year. He also imported hit arcade games, like Pac Man and Space Invaders, from Japan, tweaked the software to make the games US-friendly, and made at least a million dollars doing that, too. He made game software, too, and sold his stake in that company, Unison World, to his associate in that venture for close to $2 million. None of these companies would be his lifexe2x80x99s work, though. After selling those businesses, he moved back to Japan as a young millionaire, changed his surname back to the Korean xe2x80x9cSon,xe2x80x9d and spent about a year and a half thinking. In a 1992 interview, a decade into the SoftBankxe2x80x99s life, he told HBR:I spent all my time just thinking and thinking, studying what to do. I went to the library and bookstores. I bought books, I read all kinds of materials to prepare for what I would do for the next 50 years. Then I had about 25 success measures that I used to decide which idea to pursue. One success measure was that I should fall in love with a particular business for the next 50 years at least. He launched SoftBank, the company he still runs today, in 1981 -- 39 years ago. SoftBank started its life as a distributor of PC software at a time when computers were viewed as toys in Japan and when software was sold on disks in stores. Within one year, he grew SoftBankxe2x80x99s sales from $10,000 to $2.3 million. Six months into the new business and already restless, Masa launched two magazines simultaneously - Oh!PC and Oh!MZ. He wanted to own both software and content in the growing computer space. Over the next decade, Masa grew SoftBankxe2x80x99s sales to $354 million. Flush with cash, Masa transformed SoftBank in the 1990s, taking the first steps towards turning it into a finance company:1994: Went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at a $3 billion market cap. 1995: Bought US-based tech media company, Ziff-Davis, and Comdex, which threw events that were the SXSW of the day. 1996: Launched a venture fund; Invested $100 million for 35% of Yahoo! and created Yahoo! Japan in a JV. 1999: Turned SoftBank into a holding company.In the late xe2x80x9890s and 2000, SoftBankxe2x80x99s venture fund made over 100 investments in startups, the most successful of which is one of the best venture investments of all time. Masa personally led SoftBankxe2x80x99s $20 million investment in Alibaba, and gradually built up the position to 34% ownership. Of the meeting that led to the investment, Alibaba CEO Jack Ma told the WSJ in 2000: We didn't talk about revenues; we didn't even talk about a business model. We just talked about a shared vision. Both of us make quick decisions.When Alibaba IPOxe2x80x99d in 2014, the investment was worth $60 billion, a 3,000x return. This is one of the few times that Masaxe2x80x99s finance side paid off, and like a gambler hitting his number on the roulette wheel, gave him the irrational confidence, and bankroll, that would get him in trouble down the line.Back in 2000, fueled by the dot-com bubble, Masa briefly became the worldxe2x80x99s richest man. He told Charlie Rose, xe2x80x9cFor three days, I was richer than Bill Gates. For three days, we were a $200 billion market cap.xe2x80x9dThen, the bubble burst, and Masa lost more money than anyone in the history of the world. SoftBankxe2x80x99s market cap tumbled 99% to $2 billion, and Masaxe2x80x99s net worth followed suit, plummeting from $70 billion to $600 million.  Masa had leveraged profits from his technology operating business into financial investments. At first, it worked tremendously well, because the late 90s were a great time to be a techno-optimist. Then it failed spectacularly, because the early 2000s were a terrible time to be a techno-optimist. Despite his nauseating losses, though, Masa remained optimistic and aggressive. He foresaw that just as the xe2x80x9890s were about the rise of the internet, the mobile internet would be the next wave. But he didnxe2x80x99t have a mobile play and hexe2x80x99d (temporarily) learned his lesson about arms-length investing, so he set his sights on acquiring and operating Vodafone Japan. In 2005, before buying Vodafone, Masa flew to Cupertino to meet with Steve Jobs, bringing with him a sketch that hexe2x80x99d drawn himself of an iPod phone. He wanted Jobs to make it. Jobs told him, xe2x80x9cWexe2x80x99re actually working on this already, so I donxe2x80x99t need your sketch, but since youxe2x80x99re the first person to come and see me about this, Ixe2x80x99ll give you the exclusive rights in Japan.xe2x80x9d With the iPhone rights up his sleeve, Masa convinced a banker at Deutsche Bank, Rajeev Misra (remember that name), to loan SoftBank the $20 billion it would need for the acquisition. The bet paid off. SoftBank rebranded Vodafone Japan as SoftBank Mobile and launched the iPhone in Japan in 2008. It acquired Sprint for another $20 billion in 2013 to go deeper on mobile. From a low of 418xc2xa5 ($3.92) in late 2008, SoftBankxe2x80x99s share price more than 10xxe2x80x99ed over the next six years, peaking at 4,370xc2xa5 ($41.08) on September 14th, 2014, the day that Alibaba IPOxe2x80x99d, driven by three things: Yahoo! Japan, the Alibaba investment, and SoftBank Mobile. Riding high on his operating wins, Masa geared up for his most ambitious bet yet. If youxe2x80x99re familiar with SoftBank, itxe2x80x99s probably because of the Vision Fund. Itxe2x80x99s the most ambitious and controversial venture capital fund ever raised, and it massively distorted the private startup market. After nearly two decades operating, Masa was ready to get back to investing.When Masa met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (xe2x80x9cMBSxe2x80x9d) in September 2016, he offered him a $1 trillion gift. xe2x80x9cGive me $100 billion,xe2x80x9d he said, xe2x80x9cand I will give you back $1 trillion.xe2x80x9d Masa laid out his vision for an AI-powered future, and his plan to both bring it into being and profit from its existence through the Vision Fund. MBS was sold. After 45 minutes, he agreed to invest $45 billion. Eight months later, in May 2017, Masa launched the Vision Fund with $28 billion of SoftBankxe2x80x99s own capital, $45 billion from the Saudis, $15 billion from the UAExe2x80x99s fund, Mubadala, and $1-3 billion each from Apple, Qualcomm, Sharp, Foxconn, and Larry Ellisonxe2x80x99s family office. The fund is unique not only for its size, but for its term as well. Whereas most venture funds have a 5-10 year time horizon, the Vision Fund has a 12 year time horizon with a two year extension. Masa controls a lot of money for a long time. To run the Vision Fund, Masa brought in Rajeev Misra, the Deutsche banker who gave him the loan to acquire Vodafone Japan. SoftBank set out to make investments in companies that would bring about an AI-powered future in which humans live harmoniously with machines. It was meant to be the financial manifestation of SoftBankxe2x80x99s 30-Year Vision, as laid out in this insane 2010 presentation.Far from focusing on AI investments, however, SoftBank built a portfolio of capital intensive, atoms-based companies. When you have $100 billion to deploy, itxe2x80x99s tempting to invest in the kinds of businesses that can consume a lot of cash, even if those are the worst businesses to invest in. Over its first three years, SoftBank invested in 86 companies, including:$18.5 billion WeWork $9.3 billion in Uber $8.2 billion in ARM Holdings (about 25% of SoftBank Groupxe2x80x99s full ownership of the company) $5 billion in NVIDIA $2.5 billion in Flipkart $2.3 billion in GMxe2x80x99s Cruise $1.9 billion in PayTMInvestments in Compass, Katerra, Oyo, Opendoor, and other real estate companies The knocks on the Vision Fund are manifold: Aggressive Overbids. The Vision Fund is notorious for offering companies multiples more money at higher valuations than they were planning on raising and threatening to invest in competitors instead if they said no. If a company set out to raise $250 million, Masa asked them what theyxe2x80x99d do if they had a billion. This elbowed out other investors and inflated private market valuations for startups. Self-Markups. In order to show gains on its investments, SoftBank invested in follow-on rounds at higher valuations. Since no one else was willing to pay what they were, they were artificially setting prices higher than the private, and eventually public, markets were willing to bear.Capital as a Moat. The Vision Fund stuffed money down its portfolio companiesxe2x80x99 throats under the assumption that the best-funded startup could outspend competitors and win winner-takes-all markets. Having capital as a moat, though, meant businesses ignored real, sustainable moats. SoftBank brashly poured billions of dollars into xe2x80x9ctech-enabled businessesxe2x80x9d with large CapEx requirements, like WeWork and a dog walking company, Wag, and pushed them to grow fast. Thatxe2x80x99s how we found ourselves in the situation we did at Breather, faced with a competitor that pursued growth to the exclusion of unit economics. In many cases, though, not only was more capital not a moat, it actually actively harmed the recipient. Companies like WeWork, Wag, Brandless, Compass, and Uber abandoned the strategies and tactics that got them to where they were, pivoting to unsustainable spending in order to grow. Each of those companies has faced massive difficulties, with many having to lay off hundreds of employees and sheepishly emphasize that theyxe2x80x99re now focused on strengthening unit economics and achieving profitability.Many of the Vision Fundxe2x80x99s investments were simply bad investments, and many were good companies fatally wounded by SoftBankxe2x80x99s money and attention. Masa was a better entrepreneur than many of the entrepreneurs he invested in, and a worse investor than many of the investors he crowded out.Last July, SoftBank announced that it planned to do it again, and bigger, with the $108 billion Vision Fund 2, focused (for realsies this time) on AI investments. In the middle of fundraising, though, the wheels started to come off of Vision Fund I. In September, just weeks away from going public, WeWorkxe2x80x99s embarrassing S-1 and subsequent revelations of mismanagement tanked its IPO. In May of this year, due to a WeWork writedown and Uberxe2x80x99s post-IPO underperformance, SoftBank announced a $17.7 billion loss in the Vision Fund for the Fiscal Year ended March 31, 2020, wiping out any other SoftBank Group profits and causing a $13 billion loss for the parent company.Masa placed some of the blame on the xe2x80x9cValley of Coronavirusxe2x80x9d that many of the Vision Fundxe2x80x99s unicorns fell into. He also halted plans to raise outside capital for Vision Fund 2, moving forward with only the $38 billion that SoftBank Group invested into the fund off of its balance sheet. In March, pushed by the activist hedge fund Elliott Management, it announced plans to sell $41 billion worth of assets (it recently announced it would actually do $50 billion)  including part of its stakes in Alibaba, Sprint/T-Mobile, and SoftBank Mobile to shore up its balance sheet by paying down debt and buying back shares. That plan is underway. On July 30th, it approved a $9.6 billion tranche of buybacks, half of the nearly $20 billion it will repurchase. On August 3rd, its stock hit 6,932xc2xa5 ($65.16), higher than itxe2x80x99s been since the dot com bubble burst twenty years ago. It seemed that Masa had learned his lesson -- that itxe2x80x99s impossible to brute force your way to victory -- and was retreating before his next big push. And then last Friday, the FT reported that SoftBank was up to its old tricks again. Not content to just blow up private market valuations, SoftBank spent the last couple of months pouring fuel on public market caps. In the process, Masa has moved squarely from technology to finance, and from visionary to mercenary. After plummeting early in COVID, tech stocks have been on a tear. Some of the move has been warranted -- we have been spending more of our lives and money online, and tech companies are benefiting. But the moves have been too big, too fast. Tesla is up 800% YTD. Zoom is up over 300%. Apple is up 125% with a market cap over $2 trillion. Whispers rippled across Wall Street trading desks that a xe2x80x9cNASDAQ Whalexe2x80x9d was behind it all. Until Friday, no one thought to connect a recent announcement out of Tokyo to the move. On August 10th, along with reporting quarterly profits of $12 billion and highlighting the Vision Fundxe2x80x99s $2.8 billion quarterly gain, Masa announced the creation of a $555 million fund to invest in tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Facebook. Scratch that. Turns out 555 was just a placeholder name and not the fund size. That number is closer to $10 billion, and growing. xe2x80x9c555xe2x80x9d is slang for xe2x80x9cGo Go Goxe2x80x9d in Japanese gaming culture, and go go go it did. Over the spring and early summer, the fund bought $4 billion worth of shares in companies including Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, and Tesla. Then on Friday, the FT reported that SoftBank was the xe2x80x9cNASDAQ Whalexe2x80x9d behind billions of dollars of call option trades on the tech giants. Those trades fueled a massive rally in tech stocks, and last weekxe2x80x99s steep decline. Even with $10 billion, though, you canxe2x80x99t typically move markets. So howxe2x80x99d the 555 Fund do it? Bought $4 billion worth of shares in major tech companies. Bought $4 billion worth of call options on $30 billion worth of those same companiesxe2x80x99 shares.$4 billion is a lot of stock to buy in just a few companies, but itxe2x80x99s not unusual. $4 billion in call options, however, is an extraordinary amount, because call options can give their owners exposure to more shares for less money. With $4 billion, SoftBank was able to gain exposure to $30 billion worth of shares. Herexe2x80x99s how:Call options give the buyer the right to buy a stock at a given price (the strike price) on a certain date (expiration). As an example, Apple is trading at $120 today. With $1,000, I could either buy:Eight shares of Apple stock (xf0x9fx98xb4), or1,000 calls on Apple stock at a $170 strike price expiring on October 16th for $1 eachThe latter gives me more leverage to make money and to move Applexe2x80x99s price.Whether I buy shares or call options, the most I can lose is the $1,000 I invested. But if the price goes above $170, I can make a lot more money, and the person selling me the option can lose a lot more money, by trading calls. If the price goes to $200, I make $29,000 ($200 - $171 * 1,000). If the price somehow goes to $250, I can make $79,000. My gains and her losses can go infinitely high since stocks have unlimited upside. If the price goes to $250, Ixe2x80x99d generate a 108% return by buying the stock, but a 79x return with calls! This is why WallStreetBets traders with small accounts love options trading, and why the lottery is called the xe2x80x9cpoor tax.xe2x80x9d They give you a small chance to turn a little money into a lot. The downside is equally dizzying for the call seller, and not nearly as fun. So instead of taking that risk, she xe2x80x9chedges,xe2x80x9d either by buying shares of Apple today so that she can just give those shares to me in case the price is above $170, or by buying calls herself to neutralize her exposure. By buying either shares or calls, she pushes up their price. In either case, I win. Now with $1,000, I canxe2x80x99t actually move the market. But with $4 billion of calls, SoftBank is effectively forcing sellers to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of stock, which can push the market faster in the direction itxe2x80x99s been trending anyway.This is an incredibly Masa way to trade. Hexe2x80x99s not passive; he likes to alter the markets he plays in. In the private markets, with a $100 billion fund, he can bully companies and send valuations soaring above reasonable levels. The public markets are much bigger, though. Buying $4 billion of Apple shares would barely make a dent on the companyxe2x80x99s $2 trillion market cap. Buying $4 billion worth of calls, though, particularly during the slow summer months when a lot of traders are vacationing, gives Masa leverage to move the markets and make beaucoup bucks in the process.Itxe2x80x99s a quick way to make up losses if it works. So far, itxe2x80x99s working. Over the weekend, the FT reported that as of last week, SoftBank was actually up $4 billion on the trades, even after Thursday and Fridayxe2x80x99s decline, although they havenxe2x80x99t sold the positions yet and are at-risk if tech stocks tumble further this week. In just a couple of months, between the rise in the underlying stock prices and the options premiums, the 555 Fund has made up a good chunk of the Vision Fundxe2x80x99s losses. Options are a very dangerous game, though. Masa, and Rajeev Misra, brought in a host of ex-Deutsche Bank traders and bankers to help run SoftBank Investment Advisers, which manages both the Vision Fund and the 555 Fund. In October, efinancial careers reported that many of those people are the same ones who tanked Deutsche Bank with bad derivatives trading.Notably, the ex-DB team is largely made up of credit and derivatives traders, not tech equity investors. With this latest move, Masa has gone from technology to finance all the way to financial engineering. So what does it all mean? Is SoftBank good or evil? Should investors be bearish or bullish?Masa has a vision that no one fully appreciates, and you can buy SoftBank at a massive discount to book. For those of us who were introduced to Masa through the Vision Fund, itxe2x80x99s easy to look at his tactics and hate him, his company, and everything he stands for. But watching Masaxe2x80x99s interviews and learning more about his story, Ixe2x80x99ve come to appreciate him. Hexe2x80x99s kind of adorable, and I genuinely think he wants to make the world a better place. Plus, hexe2x80x99s been right before: His $20 million check into Alibaba was one of the best tech investments of all time.Yahoo! Japan was a major success. He nailed the timing of the mobile revolution. Convincing Steve Jobs to give him the exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in Japan before he even owned a wireless carrier is one of my new favorite business stories. With rose colored glasses on, you can even squint and see the Vision Fund as genius. 10x Genomics has doubled its market cap as a public company, the world has woken up to ByteDancexe2x80x99s value two years after Masa invested, and yxe2x80x99all know how I feel about Slack. Sure WeWork has been a dog and Uber is struggling, but maybe Masa just got a little carried away, and theyxe2x80x99re just fun stories for the media to pile onto. If just a few of the 86 investments become breakout successes, he might yet be able to return the fund, and even if he doesnxe2x80x99t, the management fees on $72 billion ($100 billion minus SoftBankxe2x80x99s own investment) are nice steady cashflow. He set the twelve year time horizon for a reason; technology bets can take time to pay off. And the 555 Fund, despite messing with the market, is up! Hexe2x80x99s wrestled gains from the jaws of defeat yet again. If it blows up, assuming theyxe2x80x99re not trading on margin, theyxe2x80x99ve only lost $4 billion in options premium, a relative drop in the bucket. But the upside is massive. Itxe2x80x99s actually kind of smart. If you subscribe to the idea that Masaxe2x80x99s still got it and is among the worldxe2x80x99s most visionary operators and investors, therexe2x80x99s a case to be made that SoftBank is just hitting an early rough patch on the road to a massive opportunity. People underestimate how big an impact technology is yet to make; Masa does not. If he needs to be the villain for a couple of years while everyone else catches up to his vision, so be it. Plus, because people think that Masa might be insane, SoftBank trades at a steep discount to the book value of its assets. Before it started selling off part of its stake in Alibaba, for example, its ownership of Alibaba was worth more than SoftBankxe2x80x99s entire market cap. When Elliott Management took a $2.5 billion position in SoftBank in February, they did so because they believed that the company could close that gap. And SoftBank is playing ball with Elliott, agreeing to the $20 billion worth of share buybacks the hedge fund demanded. In the bull case, when you buy SoftBank at its current 11 trillion yen ($104 billion) market cap, youxe2x80x99re getting a deeply discounted portfolio of assets plus the potential upside if Masa is right in his vision of the future. Hexe2x80x99s been right before. Masa is like Lennie from Of Mice and Men, loving his investments so much that he crushes them.The night before my wedding, my great friend and groomsman Nick got up to make his speech. In it, he compared my high school dating life to Lennie, a character in John Steinbeckxe2x80x99s novel, Of Mice and Men. Lennie was a simpleton. He loved his rabbits so much that when he pets them, he invariably crushes them to death. I didnxe2x80x99t harm any rabbits, but Nick argued that when I had a crush on someone, I would get so excited that I couldnxe2x80x99t play it cool. In the Neutral Case, Masa is Lennie, and tech / tech-adjacent companies are the rabbits. He couldnxe2x80x99t help himself but to turn SoftBankxe2x80x99s profits into investments in exciting new startups that matched his vision for an internet-powered future in the runup to the dot com crash. He overfunded companies through the Vision Fund not to mark up his own valuations and crowd out other investors, but because he was so excited to see what these potentially revolutionary companies could do if money was no issue. He wasnxe2x80x99t trying to manipulate the market via the 555 Fund, he just so strongly believes in the potential of technology companies that he wants long and leveraged exposure any way he can get it. Masa and SoftBank arenxe2x80x99t evil or manipulative, this argument goes, theyxe2x80x99re just really, really excited and they donxe2x80x99t know their own strength. Time will tell if their enthusiasm and approach are warranted.SoftBank is just a WallStreetBets Trader with tens of billions of other peoplexe2x80x99s money.Remember that strategy that I told you about earlier? The one in which you buy call options in big volumes to force the fund writing the calls to buy the underlying stock, driving up prices? If it sounds at all familiar, that may be because itxe2x80x99s the same one employed by the Robinhood traders on the now-infamous WallStreetBets subreddit.During COVID, one of the persistent themes in the market has been that retail traders, like the ones on WSB and people who trade on Robinhood more broadly, have been moving the markets with their dumb trades. According to this theory, thatxe2x80x99s why Teslaxe2x80x99s stock has run up, why Apple popped after it announced stock splits, and why SPACs like Virgin Galactic (SPCE) and Nikola (NKLA) have seen their shares rise in ways that donxe2x80x99t make sense given the underlying numbers. Turns out, though, that people had the right crime but the wrong culprit. This is exactly what SoftBankxe2x80x99s 555 Fund has been doing, on the largest names in the world. When it works, it works really well; if you get the timing wrong, you lose it all. In the Bear Case, this is just the latest example of Masaxe2x80x99s overeagerness to risk it all. Viewed in this light, SoftBankxe2x80x99s selling its most valuable assets to fund risky bets seems negligent at best. When I was younger and dumber, in 2013, I bought Tesla at $29, Facebook at $19, and Apple at a price I donxe2x80x99t want to think about. The market was booming, and I didnxe2x80x99t want to miss out on maximizing my gains, so I sold those stocks and rolled them into call options. Instead of a portfolio of stocks that would make me look like a genius today, I ended up with $0 on those trades. In selling stakes in Alibaba, T-Mobile, and SoftBank Mobile to bankroll a tech options hedge fund (run, I might add, by a bunch of former credit traders who ran their bank into the ground), SoftBank is doing the same thing on a much bigger budget. The Bear Case is not that SoftBank loses this 555 Fund money. Assuming they have $8 billion invested and half of it is their money, even if they lose 50%, theyxe2x80x99ve lost $2 billion. Not the end of the world. The Bear Case is that this move signifies a few worrisome things: Masa has an increasingly big risk appetite. Not content with Vision Fund gains or even price increases in the big public tech stocks, hexe2x80x99s making risky bets for the chance to achieve outsized gains. He may continue to sell off core assets to take on more risk. Masa wants easier, faster wins. You canxe2x80x99t double $4 billion in a few weeks investing in startups. Options trading is one of the only ways to do it. Hexe2x80x99s impatient and getting sloppy.Masaxe2x80x99s shifting from technology to finance, and Masa kind of sucks at finance. Other than the Alibaba investment, nearly every good thing that SoftBank has done has been when Masa focused on the operating / technology side of the business instead of the finance side. The question that investors need to ask themselves is: do I want to invest in SoftBank if itxe2x80x99s just a very big alternative asset manager that invests in the same big tech companies I can on my own? Anyone with a Robinhood account can buy calls on Tesla. Why take on all of the other risk associated with investing in SoftBank to get to the same spot? If I want to invest in a tech holding company, why not invest in Tencent, which has accumulated a more impressive portfolio, has proven its ability to add value to its investments, and has both a vision and a plan for bringing about and profiting from a tech-powered future? And if I want to invest in an alternative asset manager, why not invest in Blackstone, which is also publicly traded, has a better track record, and launched its own, more disciplined, tech growth equity fund? Plus, SoftBank lacks the subtlety to manipulate the markets in secret. Whether in private markets or public, when therexe2x80x99s a big, head-scratching inflation in prices, SoftBank is always standing right there, holding the bag. I came into this piece with an axe to grind. I expected to tear SoftBank apart, had the Bear Case written in my head, and was going to leave it at that. Ultimately, I think that Masa is just an unrelenting optimist. Optimism is an incredibly important characteristic in an entrepreneur. Only an extreme optimist would lose $69 billion, then fly to California with a sketch and a dream, convince Steve Jobs to do a deal on spec, convince a bank to loan him $20 billion, and create a legitimate challenger to Japanxe2x80x99s biggest telecom company. But naked optimism is a detriment in finance, and even venture investing. It lets you get swept up by people like Adam Neumann, who have more charisma than sense. And it allows you to YOLO trade call options on some of the worldxe2x80x99s most heavily traded stocks without covering your downside. I probably wouldnxe2x80x99t bet on Masa the Investor. There are very few people Ixe2x80x99d want to back more than Masa the Entrepreneur. Whether SoftBank is a good investment or not, to me, comes down to whether it continues to move towards Masaxe2x80x99s finance side, selling operating assets in the pursuit of higher, faster returns, or whether it rolls up its sleeves and starts making its vision come true with more than its checkbook. Ixe2x80x99m staying on the sidelines for now, but Ixe2x80x99ll be watching with fascination instead of contempt. And, I never thought Ixe2x80x99d say this, but Ixe2x80x99ll be rooting for Masa. I hope he can pull this off: Thanks for listening,PackyFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Insanely well done!

Today is a really special Not Boring for me. Wexe2x80x99re bringing back the Not Boring Investment Memo, and discussing in a company thatxe2x80x99s near and dear to me: OZE. Accredited investors in the group will have the opportunity to join the Syndicate to learn more about investing in OZE. Ixe2x80x99ll explain what the Not Boring Syndicate is, why this deal in particular is special, and do a deep dive on fintech, Africa, and OZE after a word from our sponsor.Todayxe2x80x99s Not Boring is brought to you by my very good friends at Readwise. Ixe2x80x99ve been singing Readwisexe2x80x99s praises in this newsletter for a while. I read a ton but have an absolutely terrible memory, so I sync my Kindle and Pocket highlights to Readwise, and Readwise resurfaces the good stuff every day in the app. It uses spaced repetition and active recall to help me remember the best of what I read. Between writing and Readwise, my memory sucks less than it used to, and Ixe2x80x99m maybe even a little smarter. Sign up with the Not Boring link to get smarter with a 60-day free trial: Try ReadwiseThere are a lot of newly Not Boring people here since we did the last Not Boring Syndicate deal, so I want to briefly explain what the Syndicate is all about. I like writing about companies that are very, very big, and companies that are very, very small with the potential to become very, very big. Mondays are for the former, and about once a month, Ixe2x80x99m using Thursdays for the latter. Herexe2x80x99s how it works: Not Boring sources and analyzes early stage deals, typically at seed or earlier.For the companies wexe2x80x99re investing in, I write up a Not Boring Investment Memo, like I did for Apt and Composer, and like Ixe2x80x99m doing today.Accredited investors will have the opportunity to join the syndicate on AngelList to receive more information on the deal, including a deck and terms. Wexe2x80x99ll invest together, bringing the strength of the Not Boring family to bear for the companies that we back.For sourcing, writing the memo, and running the deals, syndicate leads receive a 15-20% carry, meaning 15-20% of the upside if the deal has a positive outcome. There are no management fees. I get nothing if the deal doesnxe2x80x99t make money. The first deal that we did through the Syndicate, Composer, was a huge success. We committed even before a lead investor was in place, and oversubscribed our original $100k allocation. The Syndicate has 146 backers currently, ranging from founders to investors to operators, from the US to India, and welcome any Not Boring reader who is accredited (and that definition is broadening soon to include more people). Ixe2x80x99m really excited about it for three reasons: Not Boring gives entrepreneurs a platform to tell their stories, the more complex the better.It gives us a chance to put our money where our mouth is, together, in an asset class that is typically less accessible than public market equities.It takes startup investing out from behind closed doors - whether youxe2x80x99re investing or not, I think youxe2x80x99ll find the thought process and analysis valuable, interesting, and approachable. This isnxe2x80x99t rocket science (proof: Ixe2x80x99m not a rocket scientist). The Syndicate means access to capital for entrepreneurs, and access to unique deal flow for the Not Boring fam. Which brings us to todayxe2x80x99s deal: OZE.I want to highlight something clearly right up front: my sister founded and runs OZE. I struggled with the decision about whether I should bring my sisterxe2x80x99s company to the syndicate or just invest myself. After talking to a bunch of people, I decided to bring the deal for a few reasons: Each Person Can Decide Whether to Invest. Since this is a syndicate, not a fund, accredited investors have the opportunity to make their own decision to participate. I am not committing a pre-committed pool of capital on your behalf. I genuinely believe itxe2x80x99s a good deal. Ixe2x80x99ll spend the Memo explaining my own thought process. Two VC firms have committed to lead the round, and they are setting the terms.Unique Access. If Meghan werenxe2x80x99t my sister, most of us (me included) likely wouldnxe2x80x99t have the opportunity to invest in a West African fintech startup. Bringing Every Deal I Invest In. Ixe2x80x99ve committed to bringing any deal Ixe2x80x99m investing in myself that will work with the Syndicate to the Syndicate.Deep Trust in the Founder. I have 31 years worth of data to back up my faith. Ixe2x80x99ll brag about her in the write-up, but I trust her more than I trust me. Ultimately, itxe2x80x99s a big reputational risk to bring my own sisterxe2x80x99s deal to the table, and OZE has the commitments to raise what they need with or without us. It would be safer to just invest in this one myself and not get the Syndicate involved. Early stage investments are always more likely to go to $0 than to succeed. But I really love this deal and itxe2x80x99s certainly not boring, so fuck it.  Letxe2x80x99s get to it. On Monday, I wrote about two Irish brothers who dropped out of MIT and Harvard to launch a US-based fintech company, Stripe. Today, Ixe2x80x99m writing about my half-Irish sister who graduated from MIT and Harvard and runs a Ghana-based fintech company, OZE.In the US, we take accounting software for granted, and banks regularly give loans to small businesses to help them grow. In Africa, where small businesses are the backbone of the economy, most businesses still use paper ledger books to record transactions. That means poor insights, lack of access to credit, and too often, failure. OZE is bringing African small businesses into the digital era with a combination of mobile record-keeping, invoicing, loans, and soon, payments. They use behavioral tactics to get people to consistently enter data with machine learning to use that data to underwrite loans. To be sure, building a business in a developing country is high risk. OZE was the first subscription app in Ghana, for example, so not only did they need to educate users on mobile accounting, they needed to educate them on the business model. There was no guarantee that it would work. But high risk can mean high reward. By being first to market, OZE has mouth-watering customer acquisition dynamics and the ability to win bank deals that a company of its size would never win in a more developed market. Being first to build necessary infrastructure in a rapidly developing country requires extreme patience in the beginning, but if you get the product and the market and the onboarding and all of the little details close enough to right, it starts compounding in multiple ways at once. Thatxe2x80x99s where OZE is today. Because my sister runs OZE, it had to jump an even higher bar than normal. With that in mind, Ixe2x80x99m excited to bring this opportunity to Not Boring for five reasons: Product. OZE combines local market knowledge and an outsiderxe2x80x99s design thinking to build an accounting product that customers somehow love in a hard but valuable problem space.Bank Deal. OZE is completing a technical proof-of-concept with one of Africa's largest banks to digitize their merchant working capital loans. The commercial agreement is a profit-share and in 2019, this bank did over $1.5B in loans to small businesses. In a relatively conservative case, this deal would generate millions in net revenue for OZE. The company is raising this round to support hiring for that deal. Worldxe2x80x99s Fastest-Growing Market. West Africa is home to many of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The digital record-keeping opportunity is $960mm in Ghana and $18bn across Africa today, and at current growth rates, will be $60-100bn in a decade. Huge Investors are Backing Similar Businesses in SE Asia. Sequoia has backed record keeping businesses similar to OZE in India and Indonesia, two markets with similar growth and market characteristics to West Africa, Khatabook and BukuKas.  The Team. The OZE team is a mix of local and US, technical and business, art and science. Meghan is the perfect person to lead it. The idea for OZE came out of Meghanxe2x80x99s experience working with small businesses while she was in the Peace Corps. Countless hours of manually copying ledgers from paper notebooks into Excel gave her a nemesis, and a goal: kill paper ledgers. How Small Businesses Run in West Africa and Why Thatxe2x80x99s a ProblemWhen I went to Ghana last year, my sister took me to the markets. Markets there are different than markets in the US. Here, each vendor is equipped with a Square reader that handles payment and record keeping automatically. In a Ghanaian market, vendors take payment in cash, and record transactions with pen and paper. Paper ledgers are a problem for two reasons: Businesses canxe2x80x99t use their data to make smarter decisions.You canxe2x80x99t walk into a bank with a pile of handwritten books and get a loan. Those two factors team up to doom small businesses to continued smallness or failure. While there arenxe2x80x99t any scaled digital record-keeping companies in Africa, there are digital lenders. But since they donxe2x80x99t own record-keeping, they actually donxe2x80x99t have a good way of knowing whoxe2x80x99s serious. As a result, they mainly target consumers instead of small businesses, because consumers need smaller, and therefore less risky, loans. Tala, which has raised over $200 million and is valued at $800 million, typically starts with really small loans of around $20 and then increases loan sizes up to $500 as customers repay progressively larger loans. Sounds good, but like any system that can be gamed, people game it. Therexe2x80x99s a well-known phenomenon, xe2x80x9cspinning,xe2x80x9d in which people work up the chain, paying back loans of $20, then $40, then $100, and so on, up to the largest loan of $500xe2x80xa6 and then default and run away with $500 in their pocket. In Kenya, where Tala lends, the Central Bank of Kenya doesnxe2x80x99t allow lenders to blacklist consumers for defaulting loans under a certain amount, so spinners can move to the next app, no worries.Digital record keeping makes spinning nearly impossible for small businesses. Diligently submitting cash transactions and building credit for a business only to take a loan and run away doesnxe2x80x99t make any sense, particularly when therexe2x80x99s no other app to jump to to rebuild credit and their credit history canxe2x80x99t be accessed until they start repaying. You need to be able to analyze your data to run a good business and so paper-based ledgers are bad for business. You need to be able to access credit to grow your business, and so paper-based ledgers block growth. As a result, small businesses in Africa are left without necessary information or access to capital they need to be successful.OZE kills the paper ledger and replaces it with mobile digital record keeping, helping small businesses in Ghana and Nigeria make smarter decisions, present professionally to their customers, and receive affordable loans to help grow their businesses. By starting with record keeping, OZE is building a proprietary behavioral and financial data source on top of which itxe2x80x99s building machine learning-powered credit models. So far, itxe2x80x99s working. 97% of customers who have used OZE for at least three quarters are profitable and/or growing, extraordinary results for a market in which most small businesses fail. There are some startups, like Khatabook and BukuKas, that do record-keeping, and others, like Tala, that do digital lending. OZE is unique in the developing market in doing both. Itxe2x80x99s most similar to Square with a Quickbooks integration. OZE currently makes money in two ways, which reinforce each other: Subscriptions. OZE is a small business SaaS product that gives customers the ability to track unlimited sales and expenses for free in the app. If they want to send unlimited digital receipts to customers, send payment reminders to customers who bought on credit, download their data, add employee accounts, or access several other features that make OZE more powerful, they need to upgrade to a paid monthly subscription running from ~$2-20 per month. Unlike Khatabook and BukuKas, which give the record keeping product away for free, OZExe2x80x99s focus on the app as a revenue generating product in itself gives it a huge advantage in lending. Loans. OZE provides a modular solution to lenders: they offer lead gen, data, credit risk assessments, and digital tooling. Banks or fintech lenders can pay for any of those features a la carte or together, for a fee or % of total loan value or profits. OZExe2x80x99s record keeping product enhances its loan product in three ways:Building up the data set: 95% of transactions in most African markets, even Nigeria, are still in cash, so the only way to get an accurate picture of performance is to incentivize customers to record cash transactions. OZExe2x80x99s ability to get customers to record cash transactions is super valuable because so few companies use mobile money, at all or exclusively. A record-keeping system that captures both cash and mobile money transactions gives OZE the most complete data on small businesses. Using Oze helps businesses perform better: 97% of businesses that have used OZE for at least three quarters last year were growing and/or profitable. Simply, businesses that are growing and/or profitable are more likely to repay loans than unprofitable ones.Behavioral Data: Consistently entering accurate data (OZExe2x80x99s ML model can pick up on tell-tale signs that distinguish real data from faked data) provides important behavioral data about a business. For example, are they selling to many different customers, inputting phone numbers for the customers, and sending them receipts? Diligently entering data for months on end is much harder than xe2x80x9cspinningxe2x80x9d and provides OZE and its bank partners with another layer of proprietary data to use in underwriting loans. OZE incentivizes business owners who take a loan to use the app during their repayment period with a small rebate for compliance. And if a business owner is active on OZE (more than 10 transactions per month) they are more likely than not to be paying for their subscription. That means that while the bank or fintech is paying OZE for the loan, the small business owner is giving OZE revenue and data that will allow the app to become more powerful to the user and lower risk (and therefore interest rates) for the next loan that the customer takes. Next up, OZE is adding mobile money payments. Over the past five years, mobile money in Ghana went from xe2x80x9cWhatxe2x80x99s that?xe2x80x9d to the fastest growing mobile money market in the world. To capitalize on that growth, OZE will soon integrate Stripe-backed Paystack to offer payments. Beyond direct fees, handling payments has a host of advantages: Increase the volume of transactions recorded, Improve customer experience by automating parts of the accounting,Create higher quality data for the credit model, Allow OZE to scrape micro-repayments from the system rather than waiting for the customer to send a payment once per month. This means lower default risk, which translates to a lower cost of capital for OZExe2x80x99s customers. Payments make the whole cycle more powerful while also generating revenue for the company. By integrating with Paystack, they avoid building a payments company for each market they go into and avoid the regulation (and hefty central banking deposits that come with it) to register as a PSP. Once OZE acquires a customer, it has multiple ways to monetize them -- subscriptions, loans, and payments -- increasing their LTV. It has some major advantages on the CAC side as well:Facebook CAC is currently $0.52 because OZE has some first mover advantages: Facebook Ads Manager is shitty and slow there, so only the dedicated use itYou need a credit card, which most businesses donxe2x80x99t have Itxe2x80x99s an auction model with few other bidders Because its product supports economic development in traditionally challenging markets, OZE wins development contracts to acquire customers. It recently won a contract with the UN, which will give it $1 per customer to acquire 10k customers - at a $0.52 CAC, it will actually have a negative $0.48 CAC on these customers. Cheap customer acquisition and linked subscription, lending, and payments products create OZExe2x80x99s Flywheel.The OZE Flywheel is fueled by customers using the product, so itxe2x80x99s a good thing that customers love OZE. A few proof points: OZE has a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 74. According to Clearly Rated, the accounting industry average is 23. Apple is typically cited as the gold standard - its NPS is 72. Some businesses struggling due to COVID had to stop paying their OZE subscription to lower expenses. OZE gave some of them loans, and the first thing they spent on was re-upping OZE. One customer, who makes shoes, took a loan from OZE and made their first three month payments on the day the first monthxe2x80x99s payment was due. The owner said: The flexibility of terms and low interest got me signed on so quick. CABOOM\" I received cash within a few days. I sounded like an ambulance when I saw the message - wow wow wow wow  - because it obviously doesnxe2x80x99t work like that in my country.xe2x80x9dLove leads to engagement, engagement leads to better results and more data, and better results and more data make OZE customers attractive borrowers. From a small businessxe2x80x99 perspective, moving from paper to digital means access to capital. Continued compliance and improving business metrics mean access to cheaper capital. And access to cheaper capital enables growth.From the banksxe2x80x99 perspective, digital ledgers mean a bigger pool of businesses to which they can lend. In the markets that OZE is targeting, 90+% of businesses are small businesses. With no way to underwrite small business loans, banks are left competing heavily to win corporate clients, compressing rates and profit margins, so the real money for banks is in reaching down market where margins are higher (with the proper tech and underwriting) and therexe2x80x99s less competition. Banks are woefully unequipped to make small business loans in the year of our Lord 2020, though. OZExe2x80x99s experience working with several large banks to co-create their lending product is illustrative. During one workshop, they asked the bank to map out the small business loan approval process. It included:  Multiple (multiple!) fax machines An audit by xe2x80x9cPWC or an equivalent firmxe2x80x9d... for a business that may be doing $12k per year in revenue!  When they asked how many small businesses could meet that requirement, they were met with silence. Needless to say, banks are not lending to small businesses. According to the World Bank, there is a $360 billion credit gap in Africa, leaving 20 million businesses without access to much needed loans.Even fintechs struggle to make small business loans. They canxe2x80x99t xe2x80x9cseexe2x80x9d cash transactions so they donxe2x80x99t really understand performance. OZE provides the technology, risk assessment, and data infrastructure for digital lenders in a modularized fashion to meet the needs of the diversity of players in the market. Deals with fintechs like Pezesha are as important as traditional banking deals as early proof points of OZExe2x80x99s ability to enable better underwriting, disbursement, and repayments. They set the stage for the massive opportunity to digitize small business lending at Africaxe2x80x99s largest banks and fastest growing startups. The reason that wexe2x80x99re here today is that OZE is completing a technical proof-of-concept with one of Africa's largest banks to digitize their merchant working capital loans.The commercial agreement is a profit-share and in 2019, this bank did over $1.5B in loans to SMEs. If OZE passes the proof of concept, in a relatively conservative case in which...Loans donxe2x80x99t grow The credit gap doesnxe2x80x99t close, and Only 5% of loans go digital, ...this deal would generate millions of dollars per year in net revenue for OZE.The deal also represents additional upside for OZE: Potential to digitize this bankxe2x80x99s consumer lending (about 3x the volume of SME loans)Proof point for other large African banks Customer acquisition for OZExe2x80x99s subscription and coming-soon payments productWhile this deal is potentially transformative for OZE in the short-term, itxe2x80x99s even more important because it would establish OZE as the leader in digital record-keeping and lending to SMEs in West Africa. And West Africa is an amazing opportunity at the very beginning of its story. One of my new favorite themes to look for is the compounding effect of young users. If you can get into an underserved, high growth target market early, retain and expand with customers, and continue to acquire new low-end customers as they enter the market while also going upmarket to serve larger customers, your growth will dramatically compound over time. OZE takes advantage of something similar: the compounding effects of young markets.Itxe2x80x99s one of the main reasons I love Stripexe2x80x99s strategy. At an increasing rate, startups become big companies, and young people become decision makers. While incumbents and other competitors focus upmarket, on the most lucrative opportunity in the present, Stripe focuses on compounding over time.  The same is true for countries. Investors are funding startups in China, India, and Indonesia at an unprecedented rate because they see the opportunity to build core digital infrastructure for a less developed market and ride the marketxe2x80x99s growth to massive outcomes. West Africa is the next Southeast Asia. According to the World Bank, Ghanaxe2x80x99s GDP grew by 6.5% in 2019, and has averaged 6.8% over the past decade. It outpaced the United States by nearly 3x, and also beat out fast-growth poster children India and Indonesia. Following China, which largely leapfrogged personal computers and went direct to mobile, many Africans are skipping computers and doing everything on their phones. Smartphone penetration in Africa is growing at a 10.6% CAGR and will reach 86% of the adult population in 2025. Theyxe2x80x99re adopting mobile money even faster. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worldxe2x80x99s fastest growing mobile money market, growing 39% annually for the past decade.Today, the digital record-keeping market in Ghana alone is a $960 million opportunity across Records, Credit, and Payments. Across Africa, itxe2x80x99s worth $18 billion. Over the next five years, the TAM is expected to grow to $60-100 billion. This seems like silly, unrealistic growth, but itxe2x80x99s the result of multiple concurrent expansions: the GDP is growing at 6.5% per year while mobile money grows 39% per year while products like OZE grow the number and success rate of small businesses in Africa. Itxe2x80x99s hard to grok that kind of compounding; luckily, we have examples from markets that are a few years ahead. Comps: Khatabook and BukuKasThe demographics dynamics in West Africa are similar to those in India and Indonesia. All three are large, fast-growing, unbanked or underbanked populations with small-business-centric economies that are rapidly adopting mobile and growing their GDP at ~6% rates. Similar products in those countries provide good comps for OZE. Khatabook in India and BukuKas in Indonesia both offer digital ledgers to small business owners. Khatabook also serves consumers and facilitates payments, while BukuKas is planning to monetize via lead gen to lenders who will lend off of non-proprietary data. Both companies offer similar products to OZE but have raised far more money. In May, Khatabook announced a $60 million Series B led by Eduardo Saverinxe2x80x99s B Capital. It has raised a total of $87 million, from investors including Sequoia India and the subjects of the last two Not Borings, Stripe and Tencent, and is currently valued between $275 and $300 million. On August 19th, BukuKas announced a $9 million xe2x80x9cpre-Series Axe2x80x9d round, led by Sequoia India, bringing their total funding to $12 million.Both companies have far more users than OZE and operate in more mature markets. OZE has similar metrics to BukuKas, but BukuKas has spent more on customer acquisition because itxe2x80x99s competing head-to-head with YC-backed Bukuwarang, whereas OZE does not have a major competitor in their market and is the current market-leader in Ghana. If Africa continues to grow and the market evolves similarly to SE Asia, I see a similar opportunity for OZE. The TeamAfter college, I got a job in finance and moved to a 3-bedroom apartment with two friends in New York. Meghan, on the other hand, moved into a hut in the backyard of her host familyxe2x80x99s house in Guinea, where she would spend two years working in the Peace Corps focused on Economic Development. According to Forbes, when Meghan was there, Guinea was the worldxe2x80x99s worst country for business three years running.  To fix that, while in the Peace Corps, Meghan launched Dare to Innovate, a non-profit focused on helping entrepreneurs start businesses. Itxe2x80x99s now the largest accelerator in French-speaking Africa. A few years later, when she told the family that she was launching OZE to help digitize small businesses in West Africa, we thought it was the latest example of Meghan helping others. She corrected us. xe2x80x9cThis isnxe2x80x99t a fucking charity. West Africa is the fastest growing economy in the world.xe2x80x9dMeghanxe2x80x99s this weird dichotomy: generous and cut-throat, all wrapped into one. She started a carnival to raise money for HIV/AIDS awareness in 5th grade, but is about 1,000x less soft/emotional than me. In college, she studied Finance and Theater. After the Peace Corps, she went to work for Monitor Doblin, a blend of management and innovation consulting and design thinking.For grad school, she got her MPA from Harvardxe2x80x99s Kennedy School and her MBA from MIT Sloan, all while flying back and forth to Ghana every break she got. She joined the Peace Corps and went to West Africa to help; she committed to West Africa and launched OZE because of the massive economic opportunity. Meghanxe2x80x99s co-founder, Dave Emnett, is the operations wizard at OZE and the best digital marketer in Ghana. Dave and Meghan met through the Peace Corps, while he was stationed in Benin helping a food processing business to get organic certification and export to the US and European markets. They worked together expanding the non-profit Dare to Innovate before spinning out to start OZE. In addition to Meghan and Dave, OZExe2x80x99s exec team includes Burkinabe Tech Lead, Aly Sawadogo, who has ten years experience running tech teams in the US and Ghana, and Beninese Data & Analytics Lead, Tite Yokossi, who earned his Ph.D. in Economics from MIT.  OZE has nine more employees in Ghana, across engineering, sales, and BD. I met some of the team when I was in Ghana, and was particularly impressed by Prince Mortagbe, the Senior Customer Success Manager who spent hours and hours in OZExe2x80x99s early days physically downloading the app onto small business ownersxe2x80x99 phones in the markets. The OZE team is the right mix of local knowledge, technical aptitude, credentials, and design thinking to build a product that both small business owners and Pan African banks love to work with. What Are the Risks? Early stage investing comes with major risks, and OZE is no different. As with any early stage investment, the numbers suggest that you should expect any money you put into an early stage startup to go to $0. Here are a few OZE-specific risks:They may not be able to successfully complete the POC with the Pan-African bank or to leverage that deal into more banking deals. Adoption of record-keeping may not become widespread in a reasonable timeframe. Paystack could add record keeping, although cash is hard. The regulatory landscape can be challenging, unpredictable, and slow.OZExe2x80x99s credit risk model may not outperform traditional models when it comes to predicting credit default. Successful adoption requires both financial and tech education. Default rates may increase over time as OZE has less of a direct relationship with each borrower. Opacity in the market makes it difficult to assess bank deal values. Everything could go right and there still may not be an exit opportunity.There are certainly risks that neither I nor the OZE team is currently aware of that could sink the business. The OpportunityOZE is very early in a potentially massive market with parallels to well-funded similar businesses. Being early, and putting in the hard work of getting businesses to consistently enter cash transactions, allows OZE to own more of a businessxe2x80x99 financial infrastructure than it would be able to in a more mature, crowded market. OZE is well-positioned to both accelerate and ride the growth of the African economies that it serves -- today, Ghana and Nigeria, and soon, through a bank partnership, in 33 African countries. When itxe2x80x99s successful, OZE will do well by doing good, growing the African economy and growing its business with it.Me Da Ase (Thank You).Herexe2x80x99s the fun part.

Today is a really special Not Boring for me. Wexe2x80x99re bringing back the Not Boring Investment Memo, and discussing in a company thatxe2x80x99s near and dear to me: OZE. Accredited investors in the group will have the opportunity to join the Syndicate to learn more about investing in OZE. Ixe2x80x99ll explain what the Not Boring Syndicate is, why this deal in particular is special, and do a deep dive on fintech, Africa, and OZE after a word from our sponsor.Todayxe2x80x99s Not Boring is brought to you by my very good friends at Readwise. This is a fun one for me because Ixe2x80x99ve been singing Readwisexe2x80x99s praises in this newsletter for a while. I read a ton but have an absolutely terrible memory, so I sync my Kindle highlights and Pocket to Readwise, and Readwise resurfaces the good stuff every day in the app. It uses spaced repetition and active recall to help me remember the best of what I read. Between writing and Readwise, my memory sucks less than it used to, and Ixe2x80x99m maybe even a little smarter. Sign up with the Not Boring link to get smarter with a 60-day free trial: Try ReadwiseThere are a lot of newly Not Boring people here since we did the last Not Boring Syndicate deal, so I want to briefly explain what the Syndicate is all about. I like writing about companies that are very, very big, and companies that are very, very small with the potential to become very, very big. Mondays are for the former, and about once a month, Ixe2x80x99m using Thursdays for the latter. Herexe2x80x99s how it works: Not Boring sources and analyzes early stage deals, typically at seed or earlier.For the companies wexe2x80x99re investing in, I write up a Not Boring Investment Memo, like I did for Apt and Composer, and like Ixe2x80x99m doing today.Accredited investors will have the opportunity to join the syndicate on AngelList to receive more information on the deal, including a deck and terms. Wexe2x80x99ll invest together, bringing the strength of the Not Boring family to bear for the companies that we back.For sourcing, writing the memo, and running the deals, syndicate leads receive a 15-20% carry, meaning 15-20% of the upside if the deal has a positive outcome. There are no management fees. I get nothing if the deal doesnxe2x80x99t make money. The first deal that we did through the Syndicate, Composer, was a huge success. We committed even before a lead investor was in place, and oversubscribed our original $100k allocation. The Syndicate has 146 backers currently, ranging from founders to investors to operators, from the US to India, and welcome any Not Boring reader who is accredited (and that definition is broadening soon to include more people). Ixe2x80x99m really excited about it for three reasons: Not Boring gives entrepreneurs a platform to tell their stories, the more complex the better.It gives us a chance to put our money where our mouth is, together, in an asset class that is typically less accessible than public market equities.It takes startup investing out from behind closed doors - whether youxe2x80x99re investing or not, I think youxe2x80x99ll find the thought process and analysis valuable, interesting, and approachable.

Which brings us to todayxe2x80x99s deal: OZE.I want to highlight something clearly right up front: my sister founded and runs OZE. I struggled with the decision about whether I should bring my sisterxe2x80x99s company to the syndicate or just invest myself.

If Meghan werenxe2x80x99t my sister, most of us (me included) likely wouldnxe2x80x99t have the opportunity to invest in a West African fintech startup. Bringing Every Deal I Invest In. Ixe2x80x99ve committed to bringing any deal Ixe2x80x99m investing in myself that will work with the Syndicate to the Syndicate.Deep Trust in the Founder. I have 31 years worth of data to back up my faith. Ixe2x80x99ll brag about her in the write-up, but I trust her more than I trust me. Ultimately, itxe2x80x99s a big reputational risk to bring my own sisterxe2x80x99s deal to the table, and OZE has the commitments to raise what they need with or without us. It would be safer to just invest in this one myself and not get the Syndicate involved. Early stage investments are always more likely to go to $0 than to succeed. But I really love this deal and itxe2x80x99s certainly not boring, so fuck it.  Letxe2x80x99s get to it. On Monday, I wrote about two Irish brothers who dropped out of MIT and Harvard to launch a US-based fintech company, Stripe. Today, Ixe2x80x99m writing about my half-Irish sister who graduated from MIT and Harvard and runs a Ghana-based fintech company, OZE.In the US, we take accounting software for granted, and banks regularly give loans to small businesses to help them grow. In Africa, where small businesses are the backbone of the economy, most businesses still use paper ledger books to record transactions. That means poor insights, lack of access to credit, and too often, failure. OZE is bringing African small businesses into the digital era with a combination of mobile record-keeping, invoicing, loans, and soon, payments. They use behavioral tactics to get people to consistently enter data with machine learning to use that data to underwrite loans. To be sure, building a business in a developing country is high risk. OZE was the first subscription app in Ghana, for example, so not only did they need to educate users on mobile accounting, they needed to educate them on the business model. There was no guarantee that it would work. But high risk can mean high reward. By being first to market, OZE has mouth-watering customer acquisition dynamics and the ability to win bank deals that a company of its size would never win in a more developed market. Being first to build necessary infrastructure in a rapidly developing country requires extreme patience in the beginning, but if you get the product and the market and the onboarding and all of the little details close enough to right, it starts compounding in multiple ways at once. Thatxe2x80x99s where OZE is today. Because my sister runs OZE, it had to jump an even higher bar than normal. With that in mind, Ixe2x80x99m excited to bring this opportunity to Not Boring for five reasons: Product. OZE combines local market knowledge and an outsiderxe2x80x99s design thinking to build an accounting product that customers somehow love in a hard but valuable problem space.Bank Deal. OZE is completing a technical proof-of-concept with one of Africa's largest banks to digitize their merchant working capital loans. The commercial agreement is a profit-share and in 2019, this bank did over $1.5B in loans to small businesses. In a relatively conservative case, this deal would generate millions in net revenue for OZE. The company is raising this round to support hiring for that deal. Worldxe2x80x99s Fastest-Growing Market. West Africa is home to many of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The digital record-keeping opportunity is $960mm in Ghana and $18bn across Africa today, and at current growth rates, will be $60-100bn in a decade. Huge Investors are Backing Similar Businesses in SE Asia. Sequoia has backed record keeping businesses similar to OZE in India and Indonesia, two markets with similar growth and market characteristics to West Africa, Khatabook and BukuKas.  The Team. The OZE team is a mix of local and US, technical and business, art and science. Meghan is the perfect person to lead it. The idea for OZE came out of Meghanxe2x80x99s experience working with small businesses while she was in the Peace Corps. Countless hours of manually copying ledgers from paper notebooks into Excel gave her a nemesis, and a goal: kill paper ledgers. How Small Businesses Run in West Africa and Why Thatxe2x80x99s a ProblemWhen I went to Ghana last year, my sister took me to the markets. Markets there are different than markets in the US. Here, each vendor is equipped with a Square reader that handles payment and record keeping automatically. In a Ghanaian market, vendors take payment in cash, and record transactions with pen and paper. Paper ledgers are a problem for two reasons: Businesses canxe2x80x99t use their data to make smarter decisions.You canxe2x80x99t walk into a bank with a pile of handwritten books and get a loan. Those two factors team up to doom small businesses to continued smallness or failure. While there arenxe2x80x99t any scaled digital record-keeping companies in Africa, there are digital lenders. But since they donxe2x80x99t own record-keeping, they actually donxe2x80x99t have a good way of knowing whoxe2x80x99s serious. As a result, they mainly target consumers instead of small businesses, because consumers need smaller, and therefore less risky, loans. Tala, which has raised over $200 million and is valued at $800 million, typically starts with really small loans of around $20 and then increases loan sizes up to $500 as customers repay progressively larger loans. Sounds good, but like any system that can be gamed, people game it. Therexe2x80x99s a well-known phenomenon, xe2x80x9cspinning,xe2x80x9d in which people work up the chain, paying back loans of $20, then $40, then $100, and so on, up to the largest loan of $500xe2x80xa6 and then default and run away with $500 in their pocket. In Kenya, where Tala lends, the Central Bank of Kenya doesnxe2x80x99t allow lenders to blacklist consumers for defaulting loans under a certain amount, so spinners can move to the next app, no worries.Digital record keeping makes spinning nearly impossible for small businesses. Diligently submitting cash transactions and building credit for a business only to take a loan and run away doesnxe2x80x99t make any sense, particularly when therexe2x80x99s no other app to jump to to rebuild credit and their credit history canxe2x80x99t be accessed until they start repaying. You need to be able to analyze your data to run a good business and so paper-based ledgers are bad for business. You need to be able to access credit to grow your business, and so paper-based ledgers block growth. As a result, small businesses in Africa are left without necessary information or access to capital they need to be successful.OZE kills the paper ledger and replaces it with mobile digital record keeping, helping small businesses in Ghana and Nigeria make smarter decisions, present professionally to their customers, and receive affordable loans to help grow their businesses. By starting with record keeping, OZE is building a proprietary behavioral and financial data source on top of which itxe2x80x99s building machine learning-powered credit models. So far, itxe2x80x99s working. 97% of customers who have used OZE for at least three quarters are profitable and/or growing, extraordinary results for a market in which most small businesses fail. There are some startups, like Khatabook and BukuKas, that do record-keeping, and others, like Tala, that do digital lending. OZE is unique in the developing market in doing both. Itxe2x80x99s most similar to Square with a Quickbooks integration. OZE currently makes money in two ways, which reinforce each other: Subscriptions. OZE is a small business SaaS product that gives customers the ability to track unlimited sales and expenses for free in the app. If they want to send unlimited digital receipts to customers, send payment reminders to customers who bought on credit, download their data, add employee accounts, or access several other features that make OZE more powerful, they need to upgrade to a paid monthly subscription running from ~$2-20 per month. Unlike Khatabook and BukuKas, which give the record keeping product away for free, OZExe2x80x99s focus on the app as a revenue generating product in itself gives it a huge advantage in lending. Loans. OZE provides a modular solution to lenders: they offer lead gen, data, credit risk assessments, and digital tooling. Banks or fintech lenders can pay for any of those features a la carte or together, for a fee or % of total loan value or profits. OZExe2x80x99s record keeping product enhances its loan product in three ways:Building up the data set: 95% of transactions in most African markets, even Nigeria, are still in cash, so the only way to get an accurate picture of performance is to incentivize customers to record cash transactions. OZExe2x80x99s ability to get customers to record cash transactions is super valuable because so few companies use mobile money, at all or exclusively. A record-keeping system that captures both cash and mobile money transactions gives OZE the most complete data on small businesses. Using Oze helps businesses perform better: 97% of businesses that have used OZE for at least three quarters last year were growing and/or profitable. Simply, businesses that are growing and/or profitable are more likely to repay loans than unprofitable ones.Behavioral Data: Consistently entering accurate data (OZExe2x80x99s ML model can pick up on tell-tale signs that distinguish real data from faked data) provides important behavioral data about a business. For example, are they selling to many different customers, inputting phone numbers for the customers, and sending them receipts? Diligently entering data for months on end is much harder than xe2x80x9cspinningxe2x80x9d and provides OZE and its bank partners with another layer of proprietary data to use in underwriting loans. OZE incentivizes business owners who take a loan to use the app during their repayment period with a small rebate for compliance. And if a business owner is active on OZE (more than 10 transactions per month) they are more likely than not to be paying for their subscription. That means that while the bank or fintech is paying OZE for the loan, the small business owner is giving OZE revenue and data that will allow the app to become more powerful to the user and lower risk (and therefore interest rates) for the next loan that the customer takes. Next up, OZE is adding mobile money payments. Over the past five years, mobile money in Ghana went from xe2x80x9cWhatxe2x80x99s that?xe2x80x9d to the fastest growing mobile money market in the world. To capitalize on that growth, OZE will soon integrate Stripe-backed Paystack to offer payments. Beyond direct fees, handling payments has a host of advantages: Increase the volume of transactions recorded, Improve customer experience by automating parts of the accounting,Create higher quality data for the credit model, Allow OZE to scrape micro-repayments from the system rather than waiting for the customer to send a payment once per month. This means lower default risk, which translates to a lower cost of capital for OZExe2x80x99s customers. Payments make the whole cycle more powerful while also generating revenue for the company. By integrating with Paystack, they avoid building a payments company for each market they go into and avoid the regulation (and hefty central banking deposits that come with it) to register as a PSP. Once OZE acquires a customer, it has multiple ways to monetize them -- subscriptions, loans, and payments -- increasing their LTV. It has some major advantages on the CAC side as well:Facebook CAC is currently $0.52 because OZE has some first mover advantages: Facebook Ads Manager is shitty and slow there, so only the dedicated use itYou need a credit card, which most businesses donxe2x80x99t have Itxe2x80x99s an auction model with few other bidders Because its product supports economic development in traditionally challenging markets, OZE wins development contracts to acquire customers. It recently won a contract with the UN, which will give it $1 per customer to acquire 10k customers - at a $0.52 CAC, it will actually have a negative $0.48 CAC on these customers. Cheap customer acquisition and linked subscription, lending, and payments products create OZExe2x80x99s Flywheel.The OZE Flywheel is fueled by customers using the product, so itxe2x80x99s a good thing that customers love OZE. A few proof points: OZE has a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 74. According to Clearly Rated, the accounting industry average is 23. Apple is typically cited as the gold standard - its NPS is 72. Some businesses struggling due to COVID had to stop paying their OZE subscription to lower expenses. OZE gave some of them loans, and the first thing they spent on was re-upping OZE. One customer, who makes shoes, took a loan from OZE and made their first three month payments on the day the first monthxe2x80x99s payment was due. The owner said: The flexibility of terms and low interest got me signed on so quick. CABOOM\" I received cash within a few days. I sounded like an ambulance when I saw the message - wow wow wow wow  - because it obviously doesnxe2x80x99t work like that in my country.xe2x80x9dLove leads to engagement, engagement leads to better results and more data, and better results and more data make OZE customers attractive borrowers. From a small businessxe2x80x99 perspective, moving from paper to digital means access to capital. Continued compliance and improving business metrics mean access to cheaper capital. And access to cheaper capital enables growth.From the banksxe2x80x99 perspective, digital ledgers mean a bigger pool of businesses to which they can lend. In the markets that OZE is targeting, 90+% of businesses are small businesses. With no way to underwrite small business loans, banks are left competing heavily to win corporate clients, compressing rates and profit margins, so the real money for banks is in reaching down market where margins are higher (with the proper tech and underwriting) and therexe2x80x99s less competition. Banks are woefully unequipped to make small business loans in the year of our Lord 2020, though. OZExe2x80x99s experience working with several large banks to co-create their lending product is illustrative. During one workshop, they asked the bank to map out the small business loan approval process. It included:  Multiple (multiple!) fax machines An audit by xe2x80x9cPWC or an equivalent firmxe2x80x9d... for a business that may be doing $12k per year in revenue!  When they asked how many small businesses could meet that requirement, they were met with silence. Needless to say, banks are not lending to small businesses. According to the World Bank, there is a $360 billion credit gap in Africa, leaving 20 million businesses without access to much needed loans.Even fintechs struggle to make small business loans. They canxe2x80x99t xe2x80x9cseexe2x80x9d cash transactions so they donxe2x80x99t really understand performance. OZE provides the technology, risk assessment, and data infrastructure for digital lenders in a modularized fashion to meet the needs of the diversity of players in the market. Deals with fintechs like Pezesha are as important as traditional banking deals as early proof points of OZExe2x80x99s ability to enable better underwriting, disbursement, and repayments. They set the stage for the massive opportunity to digitize small business lending at Africaxe2x80x99s largest banks and fastest growing startups. The reason that wexe2x80x99re here today is that OZE is completing a technical proof-of-concept with one of Africa's largest banks to digitize their merchant working capital loans.The commercial agreement is a profit-share and in 2019, this bank did over $1.5B in loans to SMEs. If OZE passes the proof of concept, in a relatively conservative case in which...Loans donxe2x80x99t grow The credit gap doesnxe2x80x99t close, and Only 5% of loans go digital, ...this deal would generate millions of dollars per year in net revenue for OZE.The deal also represents additional upside for OZE: Potential to digitize this bankxe2x80x99s consumer lending (about 3x the volume of SME loans)Proof point for other large African banks Customer acquisition for OZExe2x80x99s subscription and coming-soon payments productWhile this deal is potentially transformative for OZE in the short-term, itxe2x80x99s even more important because it would establish OZE as the leader in digital record-keeping and lending to SMEs in West Africa. And West Africa is an amazing opportunity at the very beginning of its story. One of my new favorite themes to look for is the compounding effect of young users. If you can get into an underserved, high growth target market early, retain and expand with customers, and continue to acquire new low-end customers as they enter the market while also going upmarket to serve larger customers, your growth will dramatically compound over time. OZE takes advantage of something similar: the compounding effects of young markets.Itxe2x80x99s one of the main reasons I love Stripexe2x80x99s strategy. At an increasing rate, startups become big companies, and young people become decision makers. While incumbents and other competitors focus upmarket, on the most lucrative opportunity in the present, Stripe focuses on compounding over time.  The same is true for countries. Investors are funding startups in China, India, and Indonesia at an unprecedented rate because they see the opportunity to build core digital infrastructure for a less developed market and ride the marketxe2x80x99s growth to massive outcomes. West Africa is the next Southeast Asia. According to the World Bank, Ghanaxe2x80x99s GDP grew by 6.5% in 2019, and has averaged 6.8% over the past decade. It outpaced the United States by nearly 3x, and also beat out fast-growth poster children India and Indonesia. Following China, which largely leapfrogged personal computers and went direct to mobile, many Africans are skipping computers and doing everything on their phones. Smartphone penetration in Africa is growing at a 10.6% CAGR and will reach 86% of the adult population in 2025. Theyxe2x80x99re adopting mobile money even faster. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worldxe2x80x99s fastest growing mobile money market, growing 39% annually for the past decade.Today, the digital record-keeping market in Ghana alone is a $960 million opportunity across Records, Credit, and Payments. Across Africa, itxe2x80x99s worth $18 billion. Over the next five years, the TAM is expected to grow to $60-100 billion. This seems like silly, unrealistic growth, but itxe2x80x99s the result of multiple concurrent expansions: the GDP is growing at 6.5% per year while mobile money grows 39% per year while products like OZE grow the number and success rate of small businesses in Africa. Itxe2x80x99s hard to grok that kind of compounding; luckily, we have examples from markets that are a few years ahead. Comps: Khatabook and BukuKasThe demographics dynamics in West Africa are similar to those in India and Indonesia. All three are large, fast-growing, unbanked or underbanked populations with small-business-centric economies that are rapidly adopting mobile and growing their GDP at ~6% rates. Similar products in those countries provide good comps for OZE. Khatabook in India and BukuKas in Indonesia both offer digital ledgers to small business owners. Khatabook also serves consumers and facilitates payments, while BukuKas is planning to monetize via lead gen to lenders who will lend off of non-proprietary data. Both companies offer similar products to OZE but have raised far more money. In May, Khatabook announced a $60 million Series B led by Eduardo Saverinxe2x80x99s B Capital. It has raised a total of $87 million, from investors including Sequoia India and the subjects of the last two Not Borings, Stripe and Tencent, and is currently valued between $275 and $300 million. On August 19th, BukuKas announced a $9 million xe2x80x9cpre-Series Axe2x80x9d round, led by Sequoia India, bringing their total funding to $12 million.Both companies have far more users than OZE and operate in more mature markets. OZE has similar metrics to BukuKas, but BukuKas has spent more on customer acquisition because itxe2x80x99s competing head-to-head with YC-backed Bukuwarang, whereas OZE does not have a major competitor in their market and is the current market-leader in Ghana. If Africa continues to grow and the market evolves similarly to SE Asia, I see a similar opportunity for OZE. The TeamAfter college, I got a job in finance and moved to a 3-bedroom apartment with two friends in New York. Meghan, on the other hand, moved into a hut in the backyard of her host familyxe2x80x99s house in Guinea, where she would spend two years working in the Peace Corps focused on Economic Development. According to Forbes, when Meghan was there, Guinea was the worldxe2x80x99s worst country for business three years running.  To fix that, while in the Peace Corps, Meghan launched Dare to Innovate, a non-profit focused on helping entrepreneurs start businesses. Itxe2x80x99s now the largest accelerator in French-speaking Africa. A few years later, when she told the family that she was launching OZE to help digitize small businesses in West Africa, we thought it was the latest example of Meghan helping others. She corrected us. xe2x80x9cThis isnxe2x80x99t a fucking charity. West Africa is the fastest growing economy in the world.xe2x80x9dMeghanxe2x80x99s this weird dichotomy: generous and cut-throat, all wrapped into one. She started a carnival to raise money for HIV/AIDS awareness in 5th grade, but is about 1,000x less soft/emotional than me. In college, she studied Finance and Theater. After the Peace Corps, she went to work for Monitor Doblin, a blend of management and innovation consulting and design thinking.For grad school, she got her MPA from Harvardxe2x80x99s Kennedy School and her MBA from MIT Sloan, all while flying back and forth to Ghana every break she got. She joined the Peace Corps and went to West Africa to help; she committed to West Africa and launched OZE because of the massive economic opportunity. Meghanxe2x80x99s co-founder, Dave Emnett, is the operations wizard at OZE and the best digital marketer in Ghana. Dave and Meghan met through the Peace Corps, while he was stationed in Benin helping a food processing business to get organic certification and export to the US and European markets. They worked together expanding the non-profit Dare to Innovate before spinning out to start OZE. In addition to Meghan and Dave, OZExe2x80x99s exec team includes Burkinabe Tech Lead, Aly Sawadogo, who has ten years experience running tech teams in the US and Ghana, and Beninese Data & Analytics Lead, Tite Yokossi, who earned his Ph.D. in Economics from MIT.  OZE has nine more employees in Ghana, across engineering, sales, and BD. I met some of the team when I was in Ghana, and was particularly impressed by Prince Mortagbe, the Senior Customer Success Manager who spent hours and hours in OZExe2x80x99s early days physically downloading the app onto small business ownersxe2x80x99 phones in the markets. The OZE team is the right mix of local knowledge, technical aptitude, credentials, and design thinking to build a product that both small business owners and Pan African banks love to work with. What Are the Risks? Early stage investing comes with major risks, and OZE is no different. As with any early stage investment, the numbers suggest that you should expect any money you put into an early stage startup to go to $0. Here are a few OZE-specific risks:They may not be able to successfully complete the POC with the Pan-African bank or to leverage that deal into more banking deals. Adoption of record-keeping may not become widespread in a reasonable timeframe. Paystack could add record keeping, although cash is hard. The regulatory landscape can be challenging, unpredictable, and slow.OZExe2x80x99s credit risk model may not outperform traditional models when it comes to predicting credit default. Successful adoption requires both financial and tech education. Default rates may increase over time as OZE has less of a direct relationship with each borrower. Opacity in the market makes it difficult to assess bank deal values. Everything could go right and there still may not be an exit opportunity.There are certainly risks that neither I nor the OZE team is currently aware of that could sink the business. The OpportunityOZE is very early in a potentially massive market with parallels to well-funded similar businesses. Being early, and putting in the hard work of getting businesses to consistently enter cash transactions, allows OZE to own more of a businessxe2x80x99 financial infrastructure than it would be able to in a more mature, crowded market. OZE is well-positioned to both accelerate and ride the growth of the African economies that it serves -- today, Ghana and Nigeria, and soon, through a bank partnership, in 33 African countries. When itxe2x80x99s successful, OZE will do well by doing good, growing the African economy and growing its business with it.Me Da Ase (Thank You).Herexe2x80x99s the fun part.

So many smart people are so bullish on the company that I thought they must be missing something. I came away even more impressed by Stripe and optimistic about its ability to transform money on the internet. Speaking of internet moneyxe2x80xa6 my friends at The Hustle are Not Boringxe2x80x99s first ever Sponsor! Ixe2x80x99m excited about this one, because I read Trends religiously.

June 17th 2020Stripe is a payments company that describes itself using the word xe2x80x9cinfrastructure.xe2x80x9d It doesnxe2x80x99t get more boring than that in tech, and yet, Stripe is fanatically adored. People love the companyxe2x80x99s co-founders, the charming, intellectual Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison. Its mission is audacious: to increase the GDP of the internet. Engineers rave about its simple-to-use product that makes something as complex as payments just work.And yet... Stripe is underrated. Because everyone loves Stripe, the company is under analyzed. Ben Thompson hasnxe2x80x99t written a Stripe-centered piece since 2017. Sure, there are plenty of product comparisons: Stripe vs. Adyen, PayPal vs. Stripe, Stripe vs. Braintree vs. Square. CB Insights did an excellent deep dive on its history, funding, and offerings earlier this year. There are interviews and podcasts with the Collison brothers galore. The Information did one with Patrick on Saturday. But there is very little in the way of strategic analysis on the company, because writing good things about Stripe just feels clichxc3xa9. As a result, most people know that Stripe is an incredible company, but very few know why Stripe is an incredible company. So I dug in, looking to write a balanced take. I searched high and low for a bear case for the company -- so many once-gleaming unicorns have faltered recently that I wondered if Stripe didnxe2x80x99t also have some foolxe2x80x99s gold at the end of its rainbow. But clichxc3xa9s exist for a reason, and I came away even more impressed and excited about its future. Stripe is undervalued, and Ixe2x80x99ve got the numbers to prove it. The companyxe2x80x99s recent $36 billion valuation was a steal and its strategy is underappreciated.Letxe2x80x99s analyze Stripe.Stripexe2x80x99s mission is ambitious: to increase the GDP of the internet. Herexe2x80x99s how it describes itself:Stripe is a technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. Businesses of every sizexe2x80x94from new startups to public companiesxe2x80x94use our software to accept payments and manage their businesses online.But before it was an xe2x80x9ceconomic infrastructurexe2x80x9d company, Stripe was simply an easier way for startups to accept payments online with a few lines of code.Stripexe2x80x99s founding story is well-documented. In 2010, two prodigious brothers from a small village in Ireland, Patrick and John Collison, dropped out of MIT and Harvard, respectively, to start Stripe. It was their second company. They sold their first, Auctomatic, for $5 million in 2008, when they were 19 and 17. While running Auctomatic, the Collisons realized that, despite PayPalxe2x80x99s success and banksxe2x80x99 participation, accepting payments online was too hard. They felt that with more businesses starting online, engineers would decide which payment tools to use, not finance people, and built a product that engineers loved. To this day, everything from their products to their communications are designed to delight engineers. Stripexe2x80x99s first product was simple. Copy a few lines of code. Start accepting one-off payments. Since then, Stripe has expanded its payments offering to include: Connect. Payments for platforms. Booking.com accepts payments from travelers and pays out hotels using Stripe. Billing. Subscription and invoice payments. Were I to make this newsletter paid, Stripe would handle collecting money each month from those of you kind enough to subscribe.Terminal. Offline payments for online native brands. Warby Parker uses Stripe for both online and in-store purchases. Unlike Square, Stripe doesnxe2x80x99t have a salesforce knocking on bodegasxe2x80x99 doors. This, like everything else Stripe does, is a product for internet businesses, just the ones who happen to have a physical presence, too. Stripe Payouts. Payments to service providers, sellers, or freelancers. StyleSeat pays out hair stylists instantly for the jobs theyxe2x80x99ve completed. Stripe Issuing.  Virtual or physical cards for specific uses. Postmates gives its couriers cards that they can use only at specific merchants to purchase items that their customers order, and Clearbanc issues one-time virtual cards to its lending customers to be used only for online ads. Because of Stripe, internet businesses barely have to worry about payments. Typically, Stripe charges 2.9% of total value and $0.30 for each transaction. After paying banks and credit cards, Stripexe2x80x99s take rate is typically somewhere between 0.5-1% of the transaction value. Clearly, Stripe succeeds when more people buy more things online.  Stripe is evolving, though, to leverage the relationships it has with customers and the massive amount of data it sees to expand into higher-margin products. Corporate Card. Company credit cards that compete with AmEx and Brex. Stripe automatically provides limit increases based on growth and offers rewards aimed at startups and engineers. Capital. Loans for growing businesses. Stripe is able to see its customersxe2x80x99 revenue from the Payments side and costs from the Corporate Card side, and give them access to capital based on their performance. Stripe can lend next-day. Radar. Fraud and risk management. Because it has so much data, Stripe is better able to prevent fraud and prevent legit customers from being flagged as fraud. Sigma. Custom reporting.Sigma lets users pull insights directly from their Stripe data instead of having to purchase Looker or another data analytics tool.Atlas. Company incorporation. Atlas makes it easy for companies anywhere in the world to establish a Delaware corporation and a bank account. I used it for Not Boring, and it was cheap, fast, and easy. In a decade, Stripe has gone from accepting payments, which is now a commodity business, to providing an increasingly comprehensive suite of products that make it easy to start and run an online business.In Stripexe2x80x99s July website redesign, the first in over three years, Stripe went back to an old description of itself: instead of xe2x80x9cThe new standard in online payments,xe2x80x9d it calls itself xe2x80x9cPayments infrastructure for the internet.xe2x80x9d Small copy changes on its website point to larger strategic priorities. Stripe shifted from focusing solely on engineers via a self-serve product by building out a sales function for larger or less technical accounts. Can you tell the difference between these two home pages, from December 2016 and August 2017? Instead of xe2x80x9cExplore the Stackxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cCreate Account,xe2x80x9d its new buttons read xe2x80x9cCreate Accountxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cContact Sales.xe2x80x9d Engineers who want to just copy and paste some code are still welcome to do so, but now so are the larger companies with more complex needs and purchasing decisions.Some of the biggest and fastest-growing companies use Stripe -- clients include Salesforce, Amazon, Shopify, Slack, and Zoom -- not because they donxe2x80x99t have the engineering talent to build payments products, but because a company dedicated to payments like Stripe (or competitors like Adyen) can focus on all of the local integrations and edge cases that add up to a faster experience, higher acceptance rates, and less fraud. In many ways, working with large companies today is a way to improve the product for countless companies yet to be built. Itxe2x80x99s also a defensive play against competitors and a way to accumulate the data Stripe needs to continue to build products that benefit all of its customers. While it sells to corporates, Stripe's long-term vision is predicated on the companies around the globe that will launch, grow, and compound in the decades to come. As an example, Stripe has retained its soul and commitment to new companies by launching Stripe Press in 2018 to publish books that can inspire and guide hopeful entrepreneurs. Yup, a payments company published these beautiful books, each containing stories and lessons meant to educate and inspire. Stripe Press is more strategic than it appears on the surface -- it celebrates entrepreneurship and craft, both encouraging people to start companies and attracting the type of employees that Stripe needs to attract in order to build the best products. The internet economy is already 10-15x bigger than it was when the Collisons launched Stripe a decade ago, and it has ridden that growth to become the second most valuable private startup in the US. But it is still deeply undervalued.  Last September, I tweeted that Stripe could be worth more than Goldman Sachs in two years. At the time, Goldman had a market cap of $76 billion and Stripexe2x80x99s valuation was $22.5 billion. Today, Goldmanxe2x80x99s market cap is a hair lower at $72 billion, while Stripexe2x80x99s April Series G extension valued the company at $36 billion post-money. Just four months later, $36 billion looks like a steal. In fact, were it public, Stripe would be worth more than Goldman today.Herexe2x80x99s the logic. Stripe announced its $600 million round on April 16th, in the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. Since then, ecommerce has absolutely exploded. As we discussed in Shopify and the Hard Things About Easy Things, ecommerce penetration has more than doubled since the pandemic began. Before, we bought 16% of things online; now, we buy 34% of things online. That has been a boon to ecommerce companies, and Stripexe2x80x99s payments competitorsxe2x80x99 stock prices reflect that growth. Since April 16th, PayPal is up 88.5%, Adyen is up 103.4%, and Square is up an astounding 150.5%.On average, those companies have grown 114.1% since Stripe raised at a $36 billion valuation. Applying that same growth rate, Stripexe2x80x99s valuation would be over $77 billion, or $5 billion higher than Goldman Sachsxe2x80x99 current market cap.Is it fair to assume that Stripe would perform as well as its competitors during the pandemic? Itxe2x80x99s really hard to say, because Stripe isnxe2x80x99t public and doesnxe2x80x99t disclose much in the way of financial information, but we can do some back of the envelope checks. Stripe is the most heavily online company of its competitors. In fact, its underdeveloped offline product is one of competitorsxe2x80x99 main selling points against it. But itxe2x80x99s a good time to be very online. Square, which has a large point-of-sale business, actually saw a decline in Q2 payments volume, revenue, and profits. Stripe is likely growing faster than its payments competitors. Given that the vast majority of Stripexe2x80x99s business is online, Shopify is probably a better comp than its omnichannel payments competitors. While PayPal Q1 Total Payment Volume increased 16% from Q1 to Q2, Adyen and Square decreased by 7% and 11% respectively. Shopify grew its volume 73% from Q1 xe2x80x9820 to Q2 xe2x80x9820. Stripe is likely processing more payment volume than competitors. In its September 2019 funding announcement, Stripe said that it processes xe2x80x9chundreds of billions of dollars.xe2x80x9d In the most conservative interpretation, letxe2x80x99s say they processed $200 billion in transactions in 2019. At 73% growth, Stripe would be at around $350 billion in Total Payment Volume, larger than both Adyen and Square, and nearly halfway to PayPal. If you assume xe2x80x9chundreds of billionsxe2x80x9d means $400 or $500 billion, Stripe may have passed PayPal already.New businesses are launching on Stripe. As of August 10th, Patrick Collison tweeted that businesses launched on Stripe since the start of the pandemic have generated $10 billion in revenue. Patrick Collison @patrickcAugust 10th 2020Pandemic-fueled growth seems to be accelerating. On May 20th, he tweeted that businesses started on Stripe during the pandemic had generated $1 billion in revenue. Assuming March 1st as a rough pandemic start date, they did $1 billion in new revenue in two months, and $9 billion over the next three months. While itxe2x80x99s not scientific -- it canxe2x80x99t be without public numbers -- it feels almost conservative to say that Stripe would be worth more than double its last valuation if it were a public company. But Stripe also faces some challenges in the short-term that may prevent it from reaching its long-term potential.Often, when something seems too good to be true, it is. So I asked Twitter to help me uncover Stripexe2x80x99s weaknesses:August 27th 2020This is the bear case for Stripe: Payments is a commodity business and Stripe faces competition on every side - vertical solutions, more international players, cheaper options, and products more closely integrated with the banks - meaning that it will need to compete on price, particularly with larger customers, compressing its margins.More specifically, the responses fell into a few categories: Payments is a Commoditized SpaceThe biggest knock on Stripe is that the payments space is increasingly commoditized. Ten years ago, it was revolutionary to let companies accept payments online with some code. Now, a lot of companies do it. While Stripe probably wouldnxe2x80x99t disagree with the general categorization, I think it would argue that its data and scale allow it to build a differentiated and superior product. Stripe is ExpensiveCommoditization generally means that companies need to compete on price. And some people think Stripe is too expensive. Its merchant account competitors are often a few basis points cheaper, which adds up for large companies.Stripe handles this in three ways:Lower fees for bigger customers.Focus on smaller clients who prioritize ease and brand over price at the margins.Generate more revenue and cost savings for customers through superior product.Stripe isnxe2x80x99t Everywhere Businesses Want to BeFor global companies, Stripexe2x80x99s spotty international coverage is also an issue. While Stripe accepts payments from people in 195 countries, it only allows businesses in 40 countries to accept payments. Adyen positions itself as a more global solution, and as a result, has more large corporate customers including Uber, Microsoft, eBay, and Spotify. Stripe is moving quickly to remedy this, and realizes that itxe2x80x99s a hole in its offering. Itxe2x80x99s also acquiring and investing in international payments companies, like Paystack in Africa, where it has no coverage. Customer ConcentrationLarge customers and partners are an issue for Stripe right now because they have more negotiating power. By one estimate, even before the pandemic, Stripe was generating $350 million in revenue from Shopify alone. That number has likely nearly doubled since January. That gives Shopify a lot of power over Stripe - the threat of spinning up their own payments solution on the back-end to match its front-end Shop Pay solution keeps Stripexe2x80x99s take rate with Shopify razor thin. If Shopify leaves, thatxe2x80x99s a material hit to Stripexe2x80x99s revenue. Stripexe2x80x99s strategy, however, is focused on the long tail. It has millions of customers (including 1 million via Shopify) compared to ~3,500 for Adyen. It likely makes its margins on the long tail, while keeping prices low for big companies like Shopify for two reasons: 1) to keep Shopify away from competitors and 2) to collect the massive data from Shopify transactions that it can use to improve the product for all of its customers. Light on IntegrationsStripe is also light on integrations - it doesnxe2x80x99t come integrated with third-party accounting software out of the box, for example - and on vertical-specific features. Until recently, it didnxe2x80x99t have a point-of-sale solution, and Square, Adyen, and PayPal all market against Stripe highlighting that weakness.  Competitors with better integrations can steal customers who need those integrations from Stripe, force its margins down, and arrest Stripexe2x80x99s long-term trajectory. Stripexe2x80x99s competitors break into a few different categories:Merchant Accounts. Companies like Adyen and Visaxe2x80x99s Authorize.net are individual bank accounts for each business that typically have lower fees at high volumes.Direct Competitors. PayPalxe2x80x99s Braintree is directly competitive with Stripexe2x80x99s payment processing products. Plaid Payments (owned by Visa) offers a competitive product abroad with tighter bank integrations. Vertical Solutions. Companies like Toast offer products designed to solve more of a companyxe2x80x99s need within a specific industry. Toast gives restaurants point-of-sale tools, online ordering, and even payroll management designed specifically for that use case. SMB Solutions. Square gives SMBs a full suite of tools, from its original POS product to online payment processing to online storefronts in addition to building direct relationships with end users through the Cash App. Do it Yourself. Startups like Finix and Moov.io give companies the tools to build their own payment solutions in house. On certain individual features, Stripe falls short of its competitors. Stripexe2x80x99s bet is that by integrating more of the products that businesses need in one easy-to-implement, constantly improving solution while racing to fill gaps, it will be able to acquire and retain customers and move them to higher margin products. Itxe2x80x99s hard to take a Stripe bear case too seriously, because there is no way that the Collisons havenxe2x80x99t thought much more deeply about the challenges it faces than anyone else in the world. Even most of the people who responded to my tweet to offer bear cases responded with caveats like, xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m so bullish on Stripe, but if I had to build a bear casexe2x80xa6xe2x80x9d The first response I received was from Cameo CEO Steven Galanis, who said:August 27th 2020Stripe is explicitly organized to move quickly, and it fills gaps in software, hardware, and internationalization almost daily. This year alone, it has added five new countries, with plans to add more through the rest of the year. Despite the real challenges it faces, I could not be more bullish on the company. Yxe2x80x99all know how I feel about a good strategy, and Stripexe2x80x99s is brilliant. The bear case for Stripe largely exists in the present, whereas its strategy is built to compound the impact of a growing internet economy over a long time horizon. When Ezra Klein asked Patrick Collison which working CEO he admires most in a 2016 interview, he replied: The way in which Jeff Bezos has been persistently and continually able to use time horizons as a competitive advantage is something I have deep respect for. Therexe2x80x99s something quite deep about the notion of using time horizons as a competitive advantage, in that youxe2x80x99re simply willing to wait longer than other people and you have an organization that is thusly oriented.Stripe similarly uses time horizons as a competitive advantage. It began by serving an overserved segment of the market -- engineers at startups -- with a product that traded features for simplicity and speed. And itxe2x80x99s grown with them. Like Slack and Snap, Stripe takes advantage of the compounding effects of young users. At an increasing rate, startups become big companies, and young people become decision makers. While incumbents and other competitors focus upmarket, on the most lucrative opportunity in the present, Stripe focuses on compounding over time.  In his 2019 Stripe Sessions keynote, Patrick Collison said that: Our strategy is very deliberately to serve both ends of the continuum (startups and enterprises), and every point in between. This ensures we can provide the most powerful functionality to the youngest companies in the world, and that we can provide the most forward thinking technology to the largest and most established.It is both moving upmarket and riding its growing customers upmarket, and is building out more features to capture more revenue from each. The high-end of the market is actually less profitable for Stripexe2x80x99s core payments product (recall that large customers negotiate lower fees), but becomes more profitable as those companies buy more products from Stripe. It seems to be working -- 94% of enterprise customers use multiple Stripe products, and 84% use Stripe in multiple countries. That builds a double compounding advantage -- Stripexe2x80x99s revenue grows both as its customersxe2x80x99 revenue grows and as they buy more Stripe products. The thing that Ixe2x80x99m most excited to see in Stripexe2x80x99s S-1 is its net dollar expansion -- how much more customers spend with Stripe each year. This strategy relies on building moats around its business so that customers donxe2x80x99t switch to a competitor before becoming more profitable. Stripe, consequently, is a world-class moat builder. In 7 Powers, Hamilton Helmer writes about the seven moats that a business can leverage to make itself xe2x80x9cenduringly valuable.xe2x80x9d The case studies in the book highlight companies that use one or maybe two of the seven to build moats that sustain profits over a long time period. Netflix takes advantage of scale economies and counter positioning.Facebook and LinkedIn build network economies. Oracle has high switching costs.Tiffanyxe2x80x99s has a powerful brand. Pixarxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cBrain Trustxe2x80x9d is a cornered resource.Toyotaxe2x80x99s Toyota Production System demonstrates Process Power.Stripe has all seven. Scale EconomiesThe quality of declining unit costs with increased business size.Netflix is celebrated for spreading content development costs over such a large user base that it can develop new shows and movies for much less per subscriber than any competitor can. Stripe does the same thing for payment processing products. On Invest Like the Best, John Collison told Patrick Oxe2x80x99Shaughnessy: This really is a scale business, and you can just go arbitrarily deep in improving the product in all sorts of incredibly detailed ways that would never be worthwhile for any individual business.As one of many examples, Patrick Collison tweeted that Stripe built a machine learning engine xe2x80x9cto automatically optimize the bitfields of card network requestsxe2x80x9d that will generate an incremental $2.5 billion in revenue for Stripe customers in 2020. Patrick Collison @patrickcFebruary 22nd 2020I have no idea what a bitfield of card network requests is, but Stripe has enough customers that itxe2x80x99s able to make little optimizations like this that add up to huge numbers much more cheaply than competitors could, or customers could themselves. They can provide better performance for the same price. Network EconomiesThe value realized by a customer increases as the installed base increases.There is debate about whether or not Stripe has network effects, but it does: Data Network Effects. This is related to, but subtly different than, Stripexe2x80x99s economies of scale. Economies of scale allow Stripe to work on edge cases because they are able to spread the cost of building niche solutions across millions of customers, many of whom will benefit from Stripexe2x80x99s having built a solution to a very specific problem. Stripexe2x80x99s network effect comes from more users giving Stripe more data to use to detect fraud and improve acceptance rates. If I commit fraud on one website that uses Stripe, the other companies that use Stripe benefit from that information. Multiply that across billions of transactions, and Stripe has a treasure trove of data that any startup would have a nearly impossible time replicating. Counter-PositioningA newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.This is deeply related to the compounding effects of young users. Banks provided most of the payments infrastructure for the early internet economy, and selling into finance teams at large companies was in their DNA. While competitors targeted finance teams at large companies in a long, complex sales cycle that ended in long, complex integrations, Stripe let thousands and then millions of developers integrate their product quickly, no meetings required. While others focused on sales and marketing, they focused on product. Competitors couldnxe2x80x99t react, both because they couldnxe2x80x99t risk alienating existing clients, and because they couldnxe2x80x99t build excellent products. On a 2018 podcast, Patrick Collison told Tim Ferriss: If they [startups] can create a product that is so much better than the status quo that they start to get organic traction, once you attach a real sales and marketing engine to that, itxe2x80x99s going to be really frickin hard for a big company to effectively compete because this organizational transformation to being good at software is just profoundly hard.Itxe2x80x99s easier for a product company to build a sales and marketing function than for a sales and marketing company to build a product culture.Stripe is clearly an excellent product company, and it attached a sales and marketing engine years ago. But itxe2x80x99s a very Stripe sales and marketing engine that focuses on quality content and audience expansion versus paid acquisition. If you want to see this for yourself, try searching things like xe2x80x9cpayment processor,xe2x80x9d xe2x80x9conline payments,xe2x80x9d etcxe2x80xa6 I tried everything I could think of, and except for branded search (xe2x80x9cStripexe2x80x9d), Stripe was the only one of its competitors that doesnxe2x80x99t pay for search ads, because Stripe has always focused on building organic traffic through well-written content.Counter-positioning gave Stripe a multi-year head start on product and written communication. Along with its product, Stripe built a brand. BrandThe durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historical information about the seller.In my search for contrarian takes on Stripe, I spoke to someone at a large ecommerce company about how they chose their payment processing tool. He told me that they went through a process with both Stripe and Adyen, and that the products had practically identical features. His point was that Stripe isnxe2x80x99t that special. xe2x80x9cSo which did you choose?xe2x80x9d I asked. xe2x80x9cWe went with Stripe.xe2x80x9d Thatxe2x80x99s the power of brand. When the decision is neck-and-neck on features, you go with the one with the stronger brand. So how does a company that essentially collects a tax on all payments build a glowing brand? Stripe does it in four ways, all designed to build loyalty early in a companyxe2x80x99s life. Build an Excellent Product Experience. Itxe2x80x99s impossible for a software company to build an enduring brand with a weak product. Stripexe2x80x99s just works and adds delightful (read: revenue-generating or cost-saving with no additional dev work) features over time. Publish Great Content. Patrick McCkenzie, a Stripe employee better known as @patio11, said that, xe2x80x9cStripe is a celebration of the written word that happens to be incorporated in the State of Delaware.xe2x80x9d Its API documentation is loved by engineers the world over. Stripe also publishes technology-related books and documentaries under Stripe Press, and an engineering magazine, Increment. It seems a bizarre move for a payments processing tech company, but both show a commitment to progress, expertise, and a passion for high-quality communication and craftsmanship to potential customers and employees alike. Help Companies Get Their Start. Atlas allows companies to incorporate seamlessly. In the US, it makes a long, annoying, expensive process seamless. In other parts of the world, it makes the impossible possible. Over 15,000 companies have used Atlas to incorporate, one in four of which said they would not have started their company without Atlas. Additionally, Stripe bought Indie Hackers, a community for early stage product builders, to increase the probability that those young companies succeed and grow. Atlas and Indie Hackers expand the Total Addressable Market and build loyalty early. Smart, Passionate, Public Employees. In an era when so many employees, even those at startups, are disgruntled with their employers, it is remarkable to see so many xe2x80x9cStripesxe2x80x9d praising their employer so consistently. From the onboarding to the culture to the mission, Stripes seem to genuinely enjoy working together to grow the GDP of the internet. Stripe has attracted some incredible talent, and encourages them to publish their own thoughts on both related and unrelated topics freely. That sends signals to potential employees and customers that these are knowledgeable people you want to work with. In a head-to-head battle, Stripe will win on brand.  Switching CostsThe value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternate supplier for additional purchases.Once a company uses Stripe, switching to a competitor like Adyen isnxe2x80x99t technically difficult, but it does require prioritizing resources to make it happen. One person I spoke to mentioned that they wanted to switch because Stripexe2x80x99s customer support is spotty, but that they havenxe2x80x99t done it yet because of other, more pressing priorities. In many cases, switching payment solutions is a bigger risk than itxe2x80x99s worth. Imagine that you sell a subscription product, like a paid newsletter. You collect your subscriberxe2x80x99s information once, and then every month, Stripe collects money from the subscriber and sends it to you. Now imagine you want to switch to a new provider. That would require going back to all of your subscribers and asking them to re-enter their credit card information. Many wonxe2x80x99t re-enter their info, and you lose those subscribers and their revenue. Switching costs increase as companies use more Stripe products. If my corporate card is with Stripe and I take loans from Stripe Capital, is it worth lowering my spending limit and losing access to next-day loans to save 10 bps in fees? For many companies, itxe2x80x99s generally a better financial decision to stick with Stripe.Cornered ResourcePreferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.Cornered resources can include very tangible things like patents or property rights, but Stripexe2x80x99s cornered resource is that excellent people want to work together there. This point is directly related to some of the things we discussed in Brand, and also to the companyxe2x80x99s co-founders. The Collisons seem to inspire genuine respect and loyalty from otherwise cynical people. I donxe2x80x99t want to work for anyone, but Stripe is the one company for which I would seriously consider working. Ixe2x80x99ve heard a variant of that idea from people who either wouldnxe2x80x99t work for anyone but Stripe or wouldnxe2x80x99t leave their current role to go anywhere except Stripe. PayPal and Adyen, while both seemingly well-run companies, donxe2x80x99t seem to inspire that same fervor. Over years and decades, the effect of hiring the best people and setting them loose on big problems together compounds and lengthens Stripexe2x80x99s lead. Process PowerEmbedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product, and which can be matched only by an extended commitment.Stripexe2x80x99s process power comes from the way that it works, its clear written communication, the people who work there, and the speed with which it works. Stripe is an engineering company that focuses as much on the quality of its internal tooling as it does on the quality of its communications. A culture predicated on written communication and a dedication to internal tooling allows Stripe to work effectively remotely. It has more than 2,800 employees in 16 offices worldwide, and 22% of its engineering population is remote. Being good at remote is more important now than ever.Stripe also prioritizes speed. In his Invest Like the Best interview, John Collison said that, xe2x80x9cWhen a paradigm changes, speed is of the essence. And speed is a defensible trait in companies.xe2x80x9d Clear company objectives, powerful internal tools, and written communication combined with an exceedingly high caliber of employee allow Stripe to move faster by pushing decision making down in the organization. As a result, Stripe publishes updates to its core API 16 times per day. Its product gets better at an accelerating rate because of a series of linked decisions that would be nearly impossible for competitors to match. This ties back into Stripexe2x80x99s overarching strategy of compounding growth -- the more turns, the more compounding. (@Patio11xe2x80x99s Two Years at Stripe essay is chock full of examples of things that contribute to Stripexe2x80x99s process power.)Stripexe2x80x99s 7 Powers work together to build moats around a business that is reliant on acquiring young customers, keeping them as they grow, and expanding the capabilities it offers them. As one example, Stripexe2x80x99s Brand allows it to attract top talent, which is its Cornered Resource, which gives it much of its Process Power. While competitors can match Stripe on certain features and put downward pressure on price in the short-term, Stripe will win in the long-term, because its linked actions and accumulating advantages are nearly impossible for any competitor to match. Stripe is undervalued today relative to its public peers, and its strategy sets it up to capture multiples more value in the future than it is today. So there are two questions: Why isnxe2x80x99t Stripe going public? What is Stripe building towards long-term? Last week was an S-1 bonanza. Unity, Snowflake, Ant Financial, Asana, Desktop Metal, Amwell, GoodRX, and JFrog announced that they were going public, joining Palantir and Airbnb, which had already filed confidential S-1s. Stripe, worth more than all of them except for Ant on the private markets, is a glaring omission. So why isnxe2x80x99t it going public? Elon Musk has said that he isnxe2x80x99t taking SpaceX, the only private US startup with a higher valuation than Stripe, public until itxe2x80x99s doing regular trips to Mars. Stripe isnxe2x80x99t going to Mars (although Ixe2x80x99m sure it will power payments there one day), but it has a similarly big vision. Since its private market investors are likely aligned to Stripexe2x80x99s time horizon, and with no financial pressure to go public, the company is optimizing for the freedom to make long-term decisions that may not make sense to the public market in the short-term.In an interview with The Information this weekend, Patrick Collison said: As for any sort of IPO, there are core pillars of the product and the functionality we want to build for customers that we just havenxe2x80x99t finished. At some point, itxe2x80x99s likely wexe2x80x99ll either seek to [go public] or have to, but itxe2x80x99s just not a focus right now.Plus, it simply doesnxe2x80x99t have to. Stripexe2x80x99s $600 million April raise brought cash on its balance sheet to $2 billion. Stripe has only raised $1.6 billion, suggesting that either it is profitable now, was very profitable at some point, has been able to borrow large amounts of money, or some combination of the three. Its recent executive hires are the types of hires a company makes before it goes public. On August 5th, it hired Mike Clayville from AWS as its Chief Revenue Officer to lead its enterprise efforts and six days later, it hired Dhivya Suryadevara away from GM as its Chief Financial Officer. Suryadevara made $6.76 million last year at GM, most of which was in equity, suggesting that Stripe had to back up the truck. If Stripe isnxe2x80x99t going public, what do those moves mean combined with everything else wexe2x80x99ve discussed? In the short-term, Stripe is clearly going to move aggressively to fill holes in the map and its product in order to better serve enterprise customers. AWS is a canonical example of a product that pursued the same strategy as Stripe -- get into startups early and grow with them, while also moving upmarket to serve large enterprise clients. GM is a complex international business with a large lending arm. Longer-term, Stripe is building not just the infrastructure on top of which money moves -- what it calls the Global Payments and Treasury Network -- and the platform on top of which companies are built. It is moving to own every piece of the journey. What can it do then?Provide access to increasingly large amounts of non-dilutive capital. Make equity investments in businesses based on its data, a la Tencent. It already has an increasingly active venture arm. Understand the economics of any internet industry better than anyone in the world and suggest where budding entrepreneurs might build. Augment or replace large portions of finance teams with software, improving profits for its businesses. Forecast with a greater degree of accuracy than any internal model for a more complex and wide-ranging set of companies than something like Facebookxe2x80x99s Prophet. Advise governments on how to leapfrog the banking system. Africa is a noticeably large hole in the map, and one that Sqaurexe2x80x99s Jack Dorsey was planning on  physically inhabiting himself until his board stopped him.Facilitate M&A among and between customers. Take companies through the entire journey, from incorporation to going public. Regarding that last bullet, I wouldnxe2x80x99t be surprised to see Stripe acquire Carta to build a robust secondary market for startup equity that competes with the notion of going public. One more potential reason that Stripe isnxe2x80x99t going public might be that itxe2x80x99s planning to change the way that going public gets done. One of Stripexe2x80x99s biggest points-of-failure right now is that itxe2x80x99s built on top of existing banking and economic infrastructure. Itxe2x80x99s hard to imagine that Stripe will remain content to pass on hefty bank and credit card fees to customers. How much more creative leverage would entrepreneurs unlock if they got ~2% of their revenue back to spend on more productive uses? To that end, Stripe was an early supporter of crypto project Stellar, and I expect to see much more activity either in crypto or other areas that enable Stripe to rebuild economic infrastructure from the ground up. While Stripe has long touted its desire to work with the existing system, it started calling itself economic infrastructure for a reason -- it wants to improve the way we transact at a more foundational level. Building the economic infrastructure for the internet, and ultimately the Metaverse, is a massive responsibility. I wouldnxe2x80x99t trust Mark Zuckerberg with it. But Stripe possesses another cornered resource - the Collisons themselves. Their demonstrated thoughtfulness, appreciation of nuance, and dedication to intellectual rigor make them the most appropriate stewards of a new economy. Sadly (since therexe2x80x99s almost no equity Ixe2x80x99d rather own), Stripe is not going public any time soon. It is at the very beginning of a decades-long journey during which it will compound the internetxe2x80x99s growth, and compound with it to become one of the worldxe2x80x99s most valuable companies. If Stripe is successful, it will transform the economy, and Ixe2x80x99ll be here telling everyone to appreciate it even more. Thanks to Dan and Puja for editing, and to Michele for help with the research!  Thanks for reading, and see you on Thursday!

So many smart people are so bullish on the company that I thought they must be missing something. I came away even more impressed by Stripe and optimistic about its ability to transform money on the internet. Speaking of internet moneyxe2x80xa6 my friends at The Hustle are Not Boringxe2x80x99s first ever Sponsor! Ixe2x80x99m excited about this one, because I read Trends religiously.

June 17th 2020Stripe is a payments company that describes itself using the word xe2x80x9cinfrastructure.xe2x80x9d It doesnxe2x80x99t get more boring than that in tech, and yet, Stripe is fanatically adored. People love the companyxe2x80x99s co-founders, the charming, intellectual Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison. Its mission is audacious: to increase the GDP of the internet. Engineers rave about its simple-to-use product that makes something as complex as payments just work.And yet... Stripe is underrated. Because everyone loves Stripe, the company is under analyzed. Ben Thompson hasnxe2x80x99t written a Stripe-centered piece since 2017. Sure, there are plenty of product comparisons: Stripe vs. Adyen, PayPal vs. Stripe, Stripe vs. Braintree vs. Square. CB Insights did an excellent deep dive on its history, funding, and offerings earlier this year. There are interviews and podcasts with the Collison brothers galore. The Information did one with Patrick on Saturday. But there is very little in the way of strategic analysis on the company, because writing good things about Stripe just feels clichxc3xa9. As a result, most people know that Stripe is an incredible company, but very few know why Stripe is an incredible company. So I dug in, looking to write a balanced take. I searched high and low for a bear case for the company -- so many once-gleaming unicorns have faltered recently that I wondered if Stripe didnxe2x80x99t also have some foolxe2x80x99s gold at the end of its rainbow. But clichxc3xa9s exist for a reason, and I came away even more impressed and excited about its future. Stripe is undervalued. The companyxe2x80x99s recent $36 billion valuation was a steal and its strategy is underappreciated.Letxe2x80x99s analyze Stripe.Stripexe2x80x99s mission is ambitious: to increase the GDP of the internet. Herexe2x80x99s how it describes itself:Stripe is a technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. Businesses of every sizexe2x80x94from new startups to public companiesxe2x80x94use our software to accept payments and manage their businesses online.But before it was an xe2x80x9ceconomic infrastructurexe2x80x9d company, Stripe was simply an easier way for startups to accept payments online with a few lines of code.Stripexe2x80x99s founding story is well-documented. In 2010, two prodigious brothers from a small village in Ireland, Patrick and John Collison, dropped out of MIT and Harvard, respectively, to start Stripe. It was their second company. They sold their first, Auctomatic, for $5 million in 2008, when they were 19 and 17. While running Auctomatic, the Collisons realized that, despite PayPalxe2x80x99s success and banksxe2x80x99 participation, accepting payments online was too hard. They felt that with more businesses starting online, engineers would decide which payment tools to use, not finance people, and built a product that engineers loved. To this day, everything from their products to their communications are designed to delight engineers. Stripexe2x80x99s first product was simple. Copy a few lines of code. Start accepting one-off payments. Since then, Stripe has expanded its payments offering to include: Connect. Payments for platforms. Booking.com accepts payments from travelers and pays out hotels using Stripe. Billing. Subscription and invoice payments. Were I to make this newsletter paid, Stripe would handle collecting money each month from those of you kind enough to subscribe.Terminal. Offline payments for online native brands. Warby Parker uses Stripe for both online and in-store purchases. Unlike Square, Stripe doesnxe2x80x99t have a salesforce knocking on bodegasxe2x80x99 doors. This, like everything else Stripe does, is a product for internet businesses, just the ones who happen to have a physical presence, too. Stripe Payouts. Payments to service providers, sellers, or freelancers. StyleSeat pays out hair stylists instantly for the jobs theyxe2x80x99ve completed. Stripe Issuing.  Virtual or physical cards for specific uses. Postmates gives its couriers cards that they can use only at specific merchants to purchase items that their customers order, and Clearbanc issues one-time virtual cards to its lending customers to be used only for online ads. Because of Stripe, internet businesses barely have to worry about payments. Typically, Stripe charges 2.9% of total value and $0.30 for each transaction. After paying banks and credit cards, Stripexe2x80x99s take rate is typically somewhere between 0.5-1% of the transaction value. Clearly, Stripe succeeds when more people buy more things online.  Stripe is evolving, though, to leverage the relationships it has with customers and the massive amount of data it sees to expand into higher-margin products. Corporate Card. Company credit cards that compete with AmEx and Brex. Stripe automatically provides limit increases based on growth and offers rewards aimed at startups and engineers. Capital. Loans for growing businesses. Stripe is able to see its customersxe2x80x99 revenue from the Payments side and costs from the Corporate Card side, and give them access to capital based on their performance. Stripe can lend next-day. Radar. Fraud and risk management. Because it has so much data, Stripe is better able to prevent fraud and prevent legit customers from being flagged as fraud. Sigma. Custom reporting.Sigma lets users pull insights directly from their Stripe data instead of having to purchase Looker or another data analytics tool.Atlas. Company incorporation. Atlas makes it easy for companies anywhere in the world to establish a Delaware corporation and a bank account. I used it for Not Boring, and it was cheap, fast, and easy. In a decade, Stripe has gone from accepting payments, which is now a commodity business, to providing an increasingly comprehensive suite of products that make it easy to start and run an online business.In Stripexe2x80x99s July website redesign, the first in over three years, Stripe went back to an old description of itself: instead of xe2x80x9cThe new standard in online payments,xe2x80x9d it calls itself xe2x80x9cPayments infrastructure for the internet.xe2x80x9d Small copy changes on its website point to larger strategic priorities. Stripe shifted from focusing solely on engineers via a self-serve product by building out a sales function for larger or less technical accounts. Can you tell the difference between these two home pages, from December 2016 and August 2017? Instead of xe2x80x9cExplore the Stackxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cCreate Account,xe2x80x9d its new buttons read xe2x80x9cCreate Accountxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cContact Sales.xe2x80x9d Engineers who want to just copy and paste some code are still welcome to do so, but now so are the larger companies with more complex needs and purchasing decisions.Some of the biggest and fastest-growing companies use Stripe -- clients include Salesforce, Amazon, Shopify, Slack, and Zoom -- not because they donxe2x80x99t have the engineering talent to build payments products, but because a company dedicated to payments like Stripe (or competitors like Adyen) can focus on all of the local integrations and edge cases that add up to a faster experience, higher acceptance rates, and less fraud. In many ways, working with large companies today is a way to improve the product for countless companies yet to be built. Itxe2x80x99s also a defensive play against competitors and a way to accumulate the data Stripe needs to continue to build products that benefit all of its customers. While it sells to corporates, Stripe's long-term vision is predicated on the companies around the globe that will launch, grow, and compound in the decades to come. As an example, Stripe has retained its soul and commitment to new companies by launching Stripe Press in 2018 to publish books that can inspire and guide hopeful entrepreneurs. Yup, a payments company published these beautiful books, each containing stories and lessons meant to educate and inspire. Stripe Press is more strategic than it appears on the surface -- it celebrates entrepreneurship and craft, both encouraging people to start companies and attracting the type of employees that Stripe needs to attract in order to build the best products. The internet economy is already 10-15x bigger than it was when the Collisons launched Stripe a decade ago, and it has ridden that growth to become the second most valuable private startup in the US. But it is still deeply undervalued.  Last September, I tweeted that Stripe could be worth more than Goldman Sachs in two years. At the time, Goldman had a market cap of $76 billion and Stripexe2x80x99s valuation was $22.5 billion. Today, Goldmanxe2x80x99s market cap is a hair lower at $72 billion, while Stripexe2x80x99s April Series G extension valued the company at $36 billion post-money. Just four months later, $36 billion looks like a steal. In fact, were it public, Stripe would be worth more than Goldman today.Herexe2x80x99s the logic. Stripe announced its $600 million round on April 16th, in the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. Since then, ecommerce has absolutely exploded. As we discussed in Shopify and the Hard Things About Easy Things, ecommerce penetration has more than doubled since the pandemic began. Before, we bought 16% of things online; now, we buy 34% of things online. That has been a boon to ecommerce companies, and Stripexe2x80x99s payments competitorsxe2x80x99 stock prices reflect that growth. Since April 16th, PayPal is up 88.5%, Adyen is up 103.4%, and Square is up an astounding 150.5%.On average, those companies have grown 114.1% since Stripe raised at a $36 billion valuation. Applying that same growth rate, Stripexe2x80x99s valuation would be over $77 billion, or $5 billion higher than Goldman Sachsxe2x80x99 current market cap.Is it fair to assume that Stripe would perform as well as its competitors during the pandemic? Itxe2x80x99s really hard to say, because Stripe isnxe2x80x99t public and doesnxe2x80x99t disclose much in the way of financial information, but we can do some back of the envelope checks. Stripe is the most heavily online company of its competitors. In fact, its underdeveloped offline product is one of competitorsxe2x80x99 main selling points against it. But itxe2x80x99s a good time to be very online. Square, which has a large point-of-sale business, actually saw a decline in Q2 payments volume, revenue, and profits. Stripe is likely growing faster than its payments competitors. Given that the vast majority of Stripexe2x80x99s business is online, Shopify is probably a better comp than its omnichannel payments competitors. While PayPal Q1 Total Payment Volume increased 16% from Q1 to Q2, Adyen and Square decreased by 7% and 11% respectively. Shopify grew its volume 73% from Q1 xe2x80x9820 to Q2 xe2x80x9820. Stripe is likely processing more payment volume than competitors. In its September 2019 funding announcement, Stripe said that it processes xe2x80x9chundreds of billions of dollars.xe2x80x9d In the most conservative interpretation, letxe2x80x99s say they processed $200 billion in transactions in 2019. At 73% growth, Stripe would be at around $350 billion in Total Payment Volume, larger than both Adyen and Square, and nearly halfway to PayPal. If you assume xe2x80x9chundreds of billionsxe2x80x9d means $400 or $500 billion, Stripe may have passed PayPal already.New businesses are launching on Stripe. As of August 10th, Patrick Collison tweeted that businesses launched on Stripe since the start of the pandemic have generated $10 billion in revenue. Patrick Collison @patrickcAugust 10th 2020Pandemic-fueled growth seems to be accelerating. On May 20th, he tweeted that businesses started on Stripe during the pandemic had generated $1 billion in revenue. Assuming March 1st as a rough pandemic start date, they did $1 billion in new revenue in two months, and $9 billion over the next three months. While itxe2x80x99s not scientific -- it canxe2x80x99t be without public numbers -- it feels almost conservative to say that Stripe would be worth more than double its last valuation if it were a public company. But Stripe also faces some challenges in the short-term that may prevent it from reaching its long-term potential. Often, when something seems too good to be true, it is. So I asked Twitter to help me uncover Stripexe2x80x99s weaknesses:August 27th 2020This is the bear case for Stripe: Payments is a commodity business and Stripe faces competition on every side - vertical solutions, more international players, cheaper options, and products more closely integrated with the banks - meaning that it will need to compete on price, particularly with larger customers, compressing its margins.More specifically, the responses fell into a few categories: Payments is a Commoditized SpaceThe biggest knock on Stripe is that the payments space is increasingly commoditized. Ten years ago, it was revolutionary to let companies accept payments online with some code. Now, a lot of companies do it. While Stripe probably wouldnxe2x80x99t disagree with the general categorization, I think it would argue that its data and scale allow it to build a differentiated and superior product. Stripe is ExpensiveCommoditization generally means that companies need to compete on price. And some people think Stripe is too expensive. Its merchant account competitors are often a few basis points cheaper, which adds up for large companies.Stripe handles this in three ways:Lower fees for bigger customers.Focus on smaller clients who prioritize ease and brand over price at the margins.Generate more revenue and cost savings for customers through superior product.Stripe isnxe2x80x99t Everywhere Businesses Want to BeFor global companies, Stripexe2x80x99s spotty international coverage is also an issue. While Stripe accepts payments from people in 195 countries, it only allows businesses in 40 countries to accept payments. Adyen positions itself as a more global solution, and as a result, has more large corporate customers including Uber, Microsoft, eBay, and Spotify. Stripe is moving quickly to remedy this, and realizes that itxe2x80x99s a hole in its offering. Itxe2x80x99s also acquiring and investing in international payments companies, like Paystack in Africa, where it has no coverage. Customer ConcentrationLarge customers and partners are an issue for Stripe right now because they have more negotiating power. By one estimate, even before the pandemic, Stripe was generating $350 million in revenue from Shopify alone. That number has likely nearly doubled since January. That gives Shopify a lot of power over Stripe - the threat of spinning up their own payments solution on the back-end to match its front-end Shop Pay solution keeps Stripexe2x80x99s take rate with Shopify razor thin. If Shopify leaves, thatxe2x80x99s a material hit to Stripexe2x80x99s revenue. Stripexe2x80x99s strategy, however, is focused on the long tail. It has millions of customers (including 1 million via Shopify) compared to ~3,500 for Adyen. It likely makes its margins on the long tail, while keeping prices low for big companies like Shopify for two reasons: 1) to keep Shopify away from competitors and 2) to collect the massive data from Shopify transactions that it can use to improve the product for all of its customers. Light on IntegrationsStripe is also light on integrations - it doesnxe2x80x99t come integrated with third-party accounting software out of the box, for example - and on vertical-specific features. Until recently, it didnxe2x80x99t have a point-of-sale solution, and Square, Adyen, and PayPal all market against Stripe highlighting that weakness.  Competitors with better integrations can steal customers who need those integrations from Stripe, force its margins down, and arrest Stripexe2x80x99s long-term trajectory. Stripexe2x80x99s competitors break into a few different categories:Merchant Accounts. Companies like Adyen and Visaxe2x80x99s Authorize.net are individual bank accounts for each business that typically have lower fees at high volumes.Direct Competitors. PayPalxe2x80x99s Braintree is directly competitive with Stripexe2x80x99s payment processing products. Plaid Payments (owned by Visa) offers a competitive product abroad with tighter bank integrations. Vertical Solutions. Companies like Toast offer products designed to solve more of a companyxe2x80x99s need within a specific industry. Toast gives restaurants point-of-sale tools, online ordering, and even payroll management designed specifically for that use case. SMB Solutions. Square gives SMBs a full suite of tools, from its original POS product to online payment processing to online storefronts in addition to building direct relationships with end users through the Cash App. Do it Yourself. Startups like Finix and Moov.io give companies the tools to build their own payment solutions in house. On certain individual features, Stripe falls short of its competitors. Stripexe2x80x99s bet is that by integrating more of the products that businesses need in one easy-to-implement, constantly improving solution while racing to fill gaps, it will be able to acquire and retain customers and move them to higher margin products. Itxe2x80x99s hard to take a Stripe bear case too seriously, because there is no way that the Collisons havenxe2x80x99t thought much more deeply about the challenges it faces than anyone else in the world. Even most of the people who responded to my tweet to offer bear cases responded with caveats like, xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m so bullish on Stripe, but if I had to build a bear casexe2x80xa6xe2x80x9d The first response I received was from Cameo CEO Steven Galanis, who said:August 27th 2020Stripe is explicitly organized to move quickly, and it fills gaps in software, hardware, and internationalization almost daily. This year alone, it has added five new countries, with plans to add more through the rest of the year. Despite the real challenges it faces, I could not be more bullish on the company. Yxe2x80x99all know how I feel about a good strategy, and Stripexe2x80x99s is brilliant. The bear case for Stripe largely exists in the present, whereas its strategy is built to compound the impact of a growing internet economy over a long time horizon. When Ezra Klein asked Patrick Collison which working CEO he admires most in a 2016 interview, he replied: The way in which Jeff Bezos has been persistently and continually able to use time horizons as a competitive advantage is something I have deep respect for. Therexe2x80x99s something quite deep about the notion of using time horizons as a competitive advantage, in that youxe2x80x99re simply willing to wait longer than other people and you have an organization that is thusly oriented.Stripe similarly uses time horizons as a competitive advantage. It began by serving an overserved segment of the market -- engineers at startups -- with a product that traded features for simplicity and speed. And itxe2x80x99s grown with them. Like Slack and Snap, Stripe takes advantage of the compounding effects of young users. At an increasing rate, startups become big companies, and young people become decision makers. While incumbents and other competitors focus upmarket, on the most lucrative opportunity in the present, Stripe focuses on compounding over time.  In his 2019 Stripe Sessions keynote, Patrick Collison said that: Our strategy is very deliberately to serve both ends of the continuum (startups and enterprises), and every point in between. This ensures we can provide the most powerful functionality to the youngest companies in the world, and that we can provide the most forward thinking technology to the largest and most established.It is both moving upmarket and riding its growing customers upmarket, and is building out more features to capture more revenue from each. The high-end of the market is actually less profitable for Stripexe2x80x99s core payments product (recall that large customers negotiate lower fees), but becomes more profitable as those companies buy more products from Stripe. It seems to be working -- 94% of enterprise customers use multiple Stripe products, and 84% use Stripe in multiple countries. That builds a double compounding advantage -- Stripexe2x80x99s revenue grows both as its customersxe2x80x99 revenue grows and as they buy more Stripe products. The thing that Ixe2x80x99m most excited to see in Stripexe2x80x99s S-1 is its net dollar expansion -- how much more customers spend with Stripe each year. This strategy relies on building moats around its business so that customers donxe2x80x99t switch to a competitor before becoming more profitable. Stripe, consequently, is a world-class moat builder. In 7 Powers, Hamilton Helmer writes about the seven moats that a business can leverage to make itself xe2x80x9cenduringly valuable.xe2x80x9d The case studies in the book highlight companies that use one or maybe two of the seven to build moats that sustain profits over a long time period. Netflix takes advantage of scale economies and counter positioning.Facebook and LinkedIn build network economies. Oracle has high switching costs.Tiffanyxe2x80x99s has a powerful brand. Pixarxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cBrain Trustxe2x80x9d is a cornered resource.Toyotaxe2x80x99s Toyota Production System demonstrates Process Power.Stripe has all seven. Scale EconomiesThe quality of declining unit costs with increased business size.Netflix is celebrated for spreading content development costs over such a large user base that it can develop new shows and movies for much less per subscriber than any competitor can. Stripe does the same thing for payment processing products. On Invest Like the Best, John Collison told Patrick Oxe2x80x99Shaughnessy: This really is a scale business, and you can just go arbitrarily deep in improving the product in all sorts of incredibly detailed ways that would never be worthwhile for any individual business.As one of many examples, Patrick Collison tweeted that Stripe built a machine learning engine xe2x80x9cto automatically optimize the bitfields of card network requestsxe2x80x9d that will generate an incremental $2.5 billion in revenue for Stripe customers in 2020. Patrick Collison @patrickcFebruary 22nd 2020I have no idea what a bitfield of card network requests is, but Stripe has enough customers that itxe2x80x99s able to make little optimizations like this that add up to huge numbers much more cheaply than competitors could, or customers could themselves. They can provide better performance for the same price. Network EconomiesThe value realized by a customer increases as the installed base increases.There is debate about whether or not Stripe has network effects, but it does: Data Network Effects. This is related to, but subtly different than, Stripexe2x80x99s economies of scale. Economies of scale allow Stripe to work on edge cases because they are able to spread the cost of building niche solutions across millions of customers, many of whom will benefit from Stripexe2x80x99s having built a solution to a very specific problem. Stripexe2x80x99s network effect comes from more users giving Stripe more data to use to detect fraud and improve acceptance rates. If I commit fraud on one website that uses Stripe, the other companies that use Stripe benefit from that information. Multiply that across billions of transactions, and Stripe has a treasure trove of data that any startup would have a nearly impossible time replicating. Counter-PositioningA newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.This is deeply related to the compounding effects of young users. Banks provided most of the payments infrastructure for the early internet economy, and selling into finance teams at large companies was in their DNA. While competitors targeted finance teams at large companies in a long, complex sales cycle that ended in long, complex integrations, Stripe let thousands and then millions of developers integrate their product quickly, no meetings required. While others focused on sales and marketing, they focused on product. Competitors couldnxe2x80x99t react, both because they couldnxe2x80x99t risk alienating existing clients, and because they couldnxe2x80x99t build excellent products. On a 2018 podcast, Patrick Collison told Tim Ferriss: If they [startups] can create a product that is so much better than the status quo that they start to get organic traction, once you attach a real sales and marketing engine to that, itxe2x80x99s going to be really frickin hard for a big company to effectively compete because this organizational transformation to being good at software is just profoundly hard.Itxe2x80x99s easier for a product company to build a sales and marketing function than for a sales and marketing company to build a product culture.Stripe is clearly an excellent product company, and it attached a sales and marketing engine years ago. But itxe2x80x99s a very Stripe sales and marketing engine that focuses on quality content and audience expansion versus paid acquisition. If you want to see this for yourself, try searching things like xe2x80x9cpayment processor,xe2x80x9d xe2x80x9conline payments,xe2x80x9d etcxe2x80xa6 I tried everything I could think of, and except for branded search (xe2x80x9cStripexe2x80x9d), Stripe was the only one of its competitors that doesnxe2x80x99t pay for search ads, because Stripe has always focused on building organic traffic through well-written content.Counter-positioning gave Stripe a multi-year head start on product and written communication. Along with its product, Stripe built a brand. BrandThe durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historical information about the seller.In my search for contrarian takes on Stripe, I spoke to someone at a large ecommerce company about how they chose their payment processing tool. He told me that they went through a process with both Stripe and Adyen, and that the products had practically identical features. His point was that Stripe isnxe2x80x99t that special. xe2x80x9cSo which did you choose?xe2x80x9d I asked. xe2x80x9cWe went with Stripe.xe2x80x9d Thatxe2x80x99s the power of brand. When the decision is neck-and-neck on features, you go with the one with the stronger brand. So how does a company that essentially collects a tax on all payments build a glowing brand? Stripe does it in four ways, all designed to build loyalty early in a companyxe2x80x99s life. Build an Excellent Product Experience. Itxe2x80x99s impossible for a software company to build an enduring brand with a weak product. Stripexe2x80x99s just works and adds delightful (read: revenue-generating or cost-saving with no additional dev work) features over time. Publish Great Content. Patrick McCkenzie, a Stripe employee better known as @patio11, said that, xe2x80x9cStripe is a celebration of the written word that happens to be incorporated in the State of Delaware.xe2x80x9d Its API documentation is loved by engineers the world over. Stripe also publishes technology-related books and documentaries under Stripe Press, and an engineering magazine, Increment. It seems a bizarre move for a payments processing tech company, but both show a commitment to progress, expertise, and a passion for high-quality communication and craftsmanship to potential customers and employees alike. Help Companies Get Their Start. Atlas allows companies to incorporate seamlessly. In the US, it makes a long, annoying, expensive process seamless. In other parts of the world, it makes the impossible possible. Over 15,000 companies have used Atlas to incorporate, one in four of which said they would not have started their company without Atlas. Additionally, Stripe bought Indie Hackers, a community for early stage product builders, to increase the probability that those young companies succeed and grow. Atlas and Indie Hackers expand the Total Addressable Market and build loyalty early. Smart, Passionate, Public Employees. In an era when so many employees, even those at startups, are disgruntled with their employers, it is remarkable to see so many xe2x80x9cStripesxe2x80x9d praising their employer so consistently. From the onboarding to the culture to the mission, Stripes seem to genuinely enjoy working together to grow the GDP of the internet. Stripe has attracted some incredible talent, and encourages them to publish their own thoughts on both related and unrelated topics freely. That sends signals to potential employees and customers that these are knowledgeable people you want to work with. In a head-to-head battle, Stripe will win on brand.  Switching CostsThe value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternate supplier for additional purchases.Once a company uses Stripe, switching to a competitor like Adyen isnxe2x80x99t technically difficult, but it does require prioritizing resources to make it happen. One person I spoke to mentioned that they wanted to switch because Stripexe2x80x99s customer support is spotty, but that they havenxe2x80x99t done it yet because of other, more pressing priorities. In many cases, switching payment solutions is a bigger risk than itxe2x80x99s worth. Imagine that you sell a subscription product, like a paid newsletter. You collect your subscriberxe2x80x99s information once, and then every month, Stripe collects money from the subscriber and sends it to you. Now imagine you want to switch to a new provider. That would require going back to all of your subscribers and asking them to re-enter their credit card information. Many wonxe2x80x99t re-enter their info, and you lose those subscribers and their revenue. Switching costs increase as companies use more Stripe products. If my corporate card is with Stripe and I take loans from Stripe Capital, is it worth lowering my spending limit and losing access to next-day loans to save 10 bps in fees? For many companies, itxe2x80x99s generally a better financial decision to stick with Stripe.Cornered ResourcePreferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.Cornered resources can include very tangible things like patents or property rights, but Stripexe2x80x99s cornered resource is that excellent people want to work together there. This point is directly related to some of the things we discussed in Brand, and also to the companyxe2x80x99s co-founders. The Collisons seem to inspire genuine respect and loyalty from otherwise cynical people. I donxe2x80x99t want to work for anyone, but Stripe is the one company for which I would seriously consider working. Ixe2x80x99ve heard a variant of that idea from people who either wouldnxe2x80x99t work for anyone but Stripe or wouldnxe2x80x99t leave their current role to go anywhere except Stripe. PayPal and Adyen, while both seemingly well-run companies, donxe2x80x99t seem to inspire that same fervor. Over years and decades, the effect of hiring the best people and setting them loose on big problems together compounds and lengthens Stripexe2x80x99s lead. Process PowerEmbedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or superior product, and which can be matched only by an extended commitment.Stripexe2x80x99s process power comes from the way that it works, its clear written communication, the people who work there, and the speed with which it works. Stripe is an engineering company that focuses as much on the quality of its internal tooling as it does on the quality of its communications. A culture predicated on written communication and a dedication to internal tooling allows Stripe to work effectively remotely. It has more than 2,800 employees in 50 offices worldwide, and 22% of its engineering population is remote. Being good at remote is more important now than ever.Stripe also prioritizes speed. In his Invest Like the Best interview, John Collison said that, xe2x80x9cWhen a paradigm changes, speed is of the essence. And speed is a defensible trait in companies.xe2x80x9d Clear company objectives, powerful internal tools, and written communication combined with an exceedingly high caliber of employee allow Stripe to move faster by pushing decision making down in the organization. As a result, Stripe publishes updates to its core API 16 times per day. Its product gets better at an accelerating rate because of a series of linked decisions that would be nearly impossible for competitors to match. This ties back into Stripexe2x80x99s overarching strategy of compounding growth -- the more turns, the more compounding. (@Patio11xe2x80x99s Two Years at Stripe essay is chock full of examples of things that contribute to Stripexe2x80x99s process power.)Stripexe2x80x99s 7 Powers work together to build moats around a business that is reliant on acquiring young customers, keeping them as they grow, and expanding the capabilities it offers them. As one example, Stripexe2x80x99s Brand allows it to attract top talent, which is its Cornered Resource, which gives it much of its Process Power. While competitors can match Stripe on certain features and put downward pressure on price in the short-term, Stripe will win in the long-term, because its linked actions and accumulating advantages are nearly impossible for any competitor to match. Stripe is undervalued today relative to its public peers, and its strategy sets it up to capture multiples more value in the future than it is today. So there are two questions: Why isnxe2x80x99t Stripe going public? What is Stripe building towards long-term? Last week was an S-1 bonanza. Unity, Snowflake, Ant Financial, Asana, Desktop Metal, Amwell, GoodRX, and JFrog announced that they were going public, joining Palantir and Airbnb, which had already filed confidential S-1s. Stripe, worth more than all of them except for Ant on the private markets, is a glaring omission. So why isnxe2x80x99t it going public? Elon Musk has said that he isnxe2x80x99t taking SpaceX, the only private US startup with a higher valuation than Stripe, public until itxe2x80x99s doing regular trips to Mars. Stripe isnxe2x80x99t going to Mars (although Ixe2x80x99m sure it will power payments there one day), but it has a similarly big vision. Since its private market investors are likely aligned to Stripexe2x80x99s time horizon, and with no financial pressure to go public, the company is optimizing for the freedom to make long-term decisions that may not make sense to the public market in the short-term.In an interview with The Information this weekend, Patrick Collison said: As for any sort of IPO, there are core pillars of the product and the functionality we want to build for customers that we just havenxe2x80x99t finished. At some point, itxe2x80x99s likely wexe2x80x99ll either seek to [go public] or have to, but itxe2x80x99s just not a focus right now.Plus, it simply doesnxe2x80x99t have to. Stripexe2x80x99s $600 million April raise brought cash on its balance sheet to $2 billion. Stripe has only raised $1.6 billion, suggesting that either it is profitable now, was very profitable at some point, has been able to borrow large amounts of money, or some combination of the three. Its recent executive hires are the types of hires a company makes before it goes public. On August 5th, it hired Mike Clayville from AWS as its Chief Revenue Officer to lead its enterprise efforts and six days later, it hired Dhivya Suryadevara away from GM as its Chief Financial Officer. Suryadevara made $6.76 million last year at GM, most of which was in equity, suggesting that Stripe had to back up the truck. If Stripe isnxe2x80x99t going public, what do those moves mean combined with everything else wexe2x80x99ve discussed? In the short-term, Stripe is clearly going to move aggressively to fill holes in the map and its product in order to better serve enterprise customers. AWS is a canonical example of a product that pursued the same strategy as Stripe -- get into startups early and grow with them, while also moving upmarket to serve large enterprise clients. GM is a complex international business with a large lending arm. Longer-term, Stripe is building not just the infrastructure on top of which money moves -- what it calls the Global Payments and Treasury Network -- and the platform on top of which companies are built. It is moving to own every piece of the journey. What can it do then?Provide access to increasingly large amounts of non-dilutive capital. Make equity investments in businesses based on its data, a la Tencent. It already has an increasingly active venture arm. Understand the economics of any internet industry better than anyone in the world and suggest where budding entrepreneurs might build. Augment or replace large portions of finance teams with software, improving profits for its businesses. Forecast with a greater degree of accuracy than any internal model for a more complex and wide-ranging set of companies than something like Facebookxe2x80x99s Prophet. Advise governments on how to leapfrog the banking system. Africa is a noticeably large hole in the map, and one that Sqaurexe2x80x99s Jack Dorsey was planning on  physically inhabiting himself until his board stopped him.Facilitate M&A among and between customers. Take companies through the entire journey, from incorporation to going public. Regarding that last bullet, I wouldnxe2x80x99t be surprised to see Stripe acquire Carta to build a robust secondary market for startup equity that competes with the notion of going public. One more potential reason that Stripe isnxe2x80x99t going public might be that itxe2x80x99s planning to change the way that going public gets done. One of Stripexe2x80x99s biggest points-of-failure right now is that itxe2x80x99s built on top of existing banking and economic infrastructure. Itxe2x80x99s hard to imagine that Stripe will remain content to pass on hefty bank and credit card fees to customers. How much more creative leverage would entrepreneurs unlock if they got ~2% of their revenue back to spend on more productive uses? To that end, Stripe was an early supporter of crypto project Stellar, and I expect to see much more activity either in crypto or other areas that enable Stripe to rebuild economic infrastructure from the ground up. While Stripe has long touted its desire to work with the existing system, it started calling itself economic infrastructure for a reason -- it wants to improve the way we transact at a more foundational level. Building the economic infrastructure for the internet, and ultimately the Metaverse, is a massive responsibility. I wouldnxe2x80x99t trust Mark Zuckerberg with it. But Stripe possesses another cornered resource - the Collisons themselves. Their demonstrated thoughtfulness, appreciation of nuance, and dedication to intellectual rigor make them the most appropriate stewards of a new economy. Sadly (since therexe2x80x99s almost no equity Ixe2x80x99d rather own), Stripe is not going public any time soon. It is at the very beginning of a decades-long journey during which it will compound the internetxe2x80x99s growth, and compound with it to become one of the worldxe2x80x99s most valuable companies. If Stripe is successful, it will transform the economy, and Ixe2x80x99ll be here telling everyone to appreciate it even more. Thanks to Dan and Puja for editing, and to Michele for help with the research!  Thanks for listening, and see you on Thursday!PackyFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Stripe: The Internet's Most Undervalued Company (Audio) - Not Boring by Packy McCormick","url":"https://www.notboring.co/p/stripe-the-internets-most-undervalued"}

Ixe2x80x99m going to try the latter today with a short summary of the essay in slide form. You can check it out here, and Ixe2x80x99d love to hear your thoughts. Tencent's Dream PresentationIn Part I, we covered Tencentxe2x80x99s history, its current businesses, and its massive portfolio of investments. Tencent is undervalued based on its current operating businesses and the current value of its portfolio alone. But Tencentxe2x80x99s positioning for the future is even more compelling, and thatxe2x80x99s what wexe2x80x99re going to discuss in Part II today. Full Disclosure: I own shares in Tencent after doing research on it for this two-parter.Letxe2x80x99s get to it.This is the second part in a two-part series. Check out Part 1: Tencent: The Ultimate Outsider.Tencentxe2x80x99s critics argue that it gave up on its dreams by focusing on investing instead of product innovation. I disagree. Instead of building any specific product, Tencent is building an organization and ecosystem designed to be massively profitable in the short-term with asymmetric upside.Through its investments, Tencent is in the best position of any company to usher in and profit from the Metaverse, the misunderstood and potentially mega-lucrative evolution of the internet. Ixe2x80x99m not the first person to realize that Tencent is in the lead. In his recent Invest Like the Best interview, investor Matthew Ball said, xe2x80x9cSo if you said xe2x80x98who is closest to the Metaverse today?xe2x80x99 the simple answer is not Fortnite or Minecraft, itxe2x80x99s Tencent.xe2x80x9d But Tencentxe2x80x99s advantage extends beyond its lead position in gaming, because the Metaverse will be so much more than games. Look closely at Tencentxe2x80x99s portfolio and youxe2x80x99ll find a group of companies across gaming, ecommerce, and social that will bring the Metaverse to fruition and share in its massive upside. Tencentxe2x80x99s structure and strategy -- provide capital and traffic -- is the perfect model to profit from the decentralized, competitive, creator-friendly ecosystem that the Metaverse is likely to be.Thatxe2x80x99s a big claim, so herexe2x80x99s what wexe2x80x99ll cover to get there:The Metaverse. What the Metaverse is, which parts of it are here already, and how big the opportunity is.Tencentxe2x80x99s Strategy. Instead of building everything itself, Tencent invests. Its Capital + Traffic Flywheel is a smart way to bet on the Metaverse because while technologists are nearly certain that it will exist, no one knows exactly what form it will take. Platform + Content. The Metaverse will comprise the Platforms on top of which itxe2x80x99s built and Content that users interact with for entertainment, socializing, learning, and commerce. Tencent owns leading Platform candidates - Epicxe2x80x99s Unreal Engine (VR), Snap (AR), Spotify (Audio), and WeChat (internet / super app) - plus companies through which people will play, shop, learn, and socialize.Where Tencent Might Invest Next. Tencent has announced its intention to invest in infrastructure and xe2x80x9cSmart Retail,xe2x80x9d and it is likely to invest in remote work and collaboration products like Figma and Agora to round out its business offering.Obstacles. Tencent faces government regulation and well-resourced competitors. This post is fun speculation combined with practical implications. Tencentxe2x80x99s valuation doesnxe2x80x99t properly price the Metaverse opportunity -- it canxe2x80x99t, itxe2x80x99s so early and so speculative -- which means that with Tencent, you get a business that is undervalued today and a free call option on the future. I want you to leave this post with a better understanding of the Metaverse, and an appreciation for the opportunity that Tencent has to make it a reality and profit from its rise. Oh no, not another Metaverse thinkpiecexe2x80xa6 Hear me out. The term, first introduced by sci-fi author Neal Stevenson in his 1992 Snow Crash, makes the idea sound silly and game-like. It sounds a little like talking about the World Wide Web in the early 1990xe2x80x99s. Like the Web back then, the Metaverse is an important idea in need of a rebrand.So what is it?In The Metaverse, Matthew Ball says the Metaverse will be an always-on, real-time world in which an unlimited number of people can participate at the same time. It will have a fully functioning economy and span the physical and digital worlds. Data, digital items, content, and intellectual property (xe2x80x9cIPxe2x80x9d) will work across the Metaverse, and many people and companies will create the content, stores, and experiences that populate it.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney agrees, adding, xe2x80x9cit will be a massively participatory medium of a type that we really havenxe2x80x99t seen yet,xe2x80x9d with xe2x80x9c a fair economy in which all creators can participate, make money and be rewarded.xe2x80x9dThe Metaverse sounds a lot like the real world, layered with digital components at varying degrees of immersion. A participant might walk through a virtual mall and buy a digital Mickey Mouse costume in the Disney store for his avatar to wear, then pop over to the food court to pick something to eat to be delivered to his physical house via Uber Eats, and then pop into a live Beatles concert in the Spotify Performing Arts Center. He can keep the concert going in his AirPods on Spotify when he wants to go for a run in the physical world, racing against his friends in an AR Peloton-like experience.  The whole thing feels seamless - his data and purchases carry across and among physical and digital worlds.Ball, Sweeney, and everyone else Ixe2x80x99ve read on the topic agree: the Metaverse wonxe2x80x99t happen overnight. There wonxe2x80x99t be a clearly demarcated xe2x80x9cbefore the Metaversexe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cafter the Metaversexe2x80x9d divide, and it wonxe2x80x99t be built and run by one company. The Metaverse will be the result of the evolutionary convergence of many separate tools, platforms, and worlds underpinned by shared infrastructure, standards, and protocols. In fact, Marc Geffen makes the case that the Minimum Viable Metaverse is already here in games, the democratization of ecommerce, the rise of xe2x80x9cpremiumxe2x80x9d social media, and the adoption of decentralized, distributed, and remote productivity tech. The Metaverse wonxe2x80x99t be any one thing. Itxe2x80x99s not just one big video game. Itxe2x80x99s not just Second Life. Itxe2x80x99s not just a huge shopping mall. Itxe2x80x99s not the scene from Wall-E that I like to include whenever I talk about the future.Itxe2x80x99s all of those things, and the connections between them, and more. The Metaverse will be a way to blend the physical and digital worlds while allowing us to be fully present in either - itxe2x80x99s the real world, AR, VR, and the internet all rolled into one. With regards to Tencentxe2x80x99s business, three things are important to realize about the Metaverse: The Metaverse isnxe2x80x99t science fiction, itxe2x80x99s an inevitability even if its final form is unclear. Games and game engines are important, but theyxe2x80x99re just one piece of the puzzle. Owning large swaths of the Content and Platforms underpinning the Metaverse and of the content and commerce taking place within it will be highly lucrative.Ball believes that even in a conservative case, the Metaverse will be worth trillions of dollars. But itxe2x80x99s impossible to quantify, like trying to predict how big the xe2x80x9cnetxe2x80x9d was going to be back in the early 1990s. We knew it was going to happen, and we knew that it was going to be big, but we couldnxe2x80x99t have imagined exactly what it would look like, or that it would spawn multiple trillion dollar companies and many more multi-billion dollar ones.While we canxe2x80x99t know the exact what or how, the Metaverse represents an unprecedented wealth creation opportunity. And Tencent, through its investments and consolidated assets, is in the driverxe2x80x99s seat. Which brings us back to Tencentxe2x80x99s dreams. A strategic decision nine years ago accidentally set Tencent up to create more value from the Metaverse than it does from its entire core business by focusing on investment over organic growth.After reading Part I, Rui Ma pointed me to the Tech Buzz China podcast in which she and Ying Lu discuss Pan Luanxe2x80x99s 2018 piece titled xe2x80x9cTencent Has No Dreams.xe2x80x9d In it, he argues that a 2011 decision at a management team offsite caused Tencent to lose sight of its product-focused roots. Back in 2011, Baidu passed Tencent as the most valuable tech company in China, and Pony Ma called a meeting of his top management to chart a new course for the company. In the meeting, dubbed xe2x80x9cThe Conference of the Gods,xe2x80x9d he asked his 16 top executives to list out Tencentxe2x80x99s core competitive advantages. Two winners emerged: capital and traffic. Led by President Martin Lau and his former Goldman colleague James Mitchell, who he brought on as Chief Strategy Officer, Tencent built its strategy on this flywheel of capital and traffic. Attract companies to build on its platform with huge traffic, invest in the winners, give them more traffic, invest more or acquire the winners, generate more traffic, attract more companies, and so on. It runs essentially the same playbook with foreign companies who want access to China.The strategy seems to be working. Since that 2011 meeting, Tencentxe2x80x99s stock has increased nearly 15x, from $44.5 billion to $660 billion. Luan warned, though, that xe2x80x9cHidden behind the ten-fold increase in market value is the investment banking thinking that focuses too much on short-term ROI.xe2x80x9d He cites the fact that Tencent missed out on short-term video, kills internal projects quickly based on ROI calculations, and failed to internationalize WeChat. Luan also argues that Tencentxe2x80x99s intolerance of failure leads to a lack of innovation and talent development, painting the picture of Tencent as a place where, xe2x80x9cSmart people just make PowerPoints and quarrel with each other.xe2x80x9d Luanxe2x80x99s argument boils down to one thatxe2x80x99s familiar to the American tech giants: they canxe2x80x99t innovate anymore, so they just copy and acquire. Facebookxe2x80x99s internal projects are flops, so it acquired Instagram and Oculus and WhatsApp and copied Snap Stories. Google canxe2x80x99t create anything new beyond search (remember Google+??), so it acquired Android and YouTube and DoubleClick. But Tencentxe2x80x99s focus on investment over organic innovation is really smart for two reasons. First, building a startup is an exercise in innovation; running a large company is an exercise in capital allocation (recall The Outsiders). At this point, Tencent creating all of its own products would actually be inefficient. The companyxe2x80x99s best minds should be focused on building an organization and ecosystem that sets it up to catch the next major wave of growth. Second, investment versus full ownership is the right way to play the Metaverse opportunity. If the Metaverse is going to be decentralized and more profits will accrue to creators, it makes financial sense to spread bets across both platforms and content creators instead of trying to build one central platform, like a WeChat version of the Metaverse. Historically, Tencent has evolved its approach to meet evolving tech trends. It launched QQ to capitalize on the rise of the internet in China and it built WeChat to ride the mobile wave. Now itxe2x80x99s building a portfolio of companies that position it to profit from the shift that has the potential to create more economic value than either of the previous two. Never heard of a Metaverse or Fortnite before?

I read whatever Tom writes to catch the next Fortnite or Snap early, so I'm pumped that Tom asked to sponsor today's post. Sign up here - it's free, and it will keep you young.Subscribe to GZVThere are two big components of the Metaverse: Platform (where) and Content (what). Tencent owns stakes in more of the components of each than any company in the world. The magic of the Metaverse is that it will seamlessly integrate the myriad platforms on which we socialize, work, and consume - merging Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), audio, the internet, and the physical world. Tencent owns key players in each, including Epic, Snap, Spotify, WeChat, and even physical retail. VR: Epic (Unreal Engine)In Tencentxe2x80x99s Metaverse solar system, Epic is the sun. In many ways, its major title, Fortnite, is the closest thing we have to the Metaverse today. Looks Like the Metaverse We Think Of: Itxe2x80x99s a persistent, synchronous, live virtual world, complete with shared group experiences like the Travis Scott concert.IP Melting Pot: Competing IP co-exists in Fortnite - you can buy both Marvel and DC skins, NFL jerseys and Jordan sneakers, or be John Wick or Ariana Grande (link)Cross-Platform: Players can play against each other on competing consoles or platforms - players on Mac, Playstation, Xbox, and Android can all play against each other.Participatory: In Creative Mode, players can build their own worlds, and Epic has partnered with creators from the community to develop and sell their skins. Epic is running the Traffic side of the Tencent playbook - because all of the players are on Fortnite, it can get consumer-friendly deals out of parties -- like IP holders and game console makers -- that others cannot. Fortnite is just a trial run for a bigger prize, though. It puts Epicxe2x80x99s Unreal Engine in the prime position to become the Platform on top of which many of the virtual components of the Metaverse are built. Game developers, filmmakers, and architects alike use its Unreal Engine to build rich, immersive digital renderings and worlds. Popular game Gears of War, Disney+ hit The Mandalorian, and leading architects Foster + Partners and Gensler all build with Unreal. A shopping mall designed in Unreal Engine, SourceAs more games, movies, cities, and buildings are built on the same engine, it becomes easier to stitch together a full virtual world. And more will build with Unreal and Epic, because the company is practically giving away its best-in-class tools for free. Epic has the lowest store fees of its competitors (12%), the most publisher-friendly publishing tools, and the most open ecosystem. If a competitor wants to work with Epic, Epic will work with it. Epic does all of this in service of the creators, large and small, who it sees as crucial to pulling the Metaverse forward in time, and to creating a massive Total Addressable Market. The more money creators can make, the thinking goes, the more likely they are to create, the more attractive it will be for users to spend time in the Metaverse, and the more lucrative it will be to be the engine building the Metaverse.Tencent owns 40% of Epic, which recently raised at a $17.3 billion valuation, and looking 10-20 years into the future, that 40% stake could be worth more than all of Tencent today. But itxe2x80x99s just one component of Tencentxe2x80x99s Metaverse Platform play. Another crucially important piece is Snap. AR: SnapTencent is Snapxe2x80x99s largest shareholder, with 12% ownership (although no outside investor has voting rights or control). If Epic is a leading contender to build the virtual world components of the Metaverse, Snap is a leading contender to build the AR components, or Mirrorworld. As I wrote in Oh Snap!:Mirrorworld, according to Kelly, wonxe2x80x99t take place in Virtual Reality (VR), but rather in Augmented Reality (AR). It will blend digital and physical, layering bitsxe2x80x99 infinite possibilities on top of atomsxe2x80x99 realness. Snap is employing the Amazon xe2x80x9cFirst and Best Customerxe2x80x9d strategy. It builds products for its own app first - like Lenses, its first AR hit - and then opens up the tools to both its community to create within Snapchat, and third-party developers to incorporate Snapchatxe2x80x99s features into third-party apps. Snap is building a wide-ranging set of products that build off of each other and work together to lead to a future in which Snap powers the Mirrorworld.Herexe2x80x99s a glimpse from Snapxe2x80x99s Partner Summit:Like Epic, Snap isnxe2x80x99t building a closed ecosystem. Itxe2x80x99s building the tools that others can use to build and profit from AR experiences, inside or outside of the Snapchat product, so that it becomes the platform on top of which developers build the Mirrorworld. Camera Kit: Gives any developer the power of Snapxe2x80x99s Camera, the most widely used piece of AR technology in the world. Bitmoji: Snap owns Bitmoji, which gives everyone their own personalized avatar to use within Snap Games and Minis, and across many external apps, platforms, and OSxe2x80x99s. Snap Kit: Powers 20 of the top 100 apps in the iOS and Google app stores. Local Lenses: Allow users and businesses to build digital worlds on top of the physical one. Snap will be a leader in AR and continue to grow as its user base matures, which will put it among the tech giants in terms of valuation. Today, itxe2x80x99s valued at 1/70th of Apple and 1/30th of Google. If it catches up to where the tech giants are today, Tencentxe2x80x99s stake will be worth over $100 billion. (Insert $100 billion in 10 years meme here)Audio: SpotifyTherexe2x80x99s a version of the Metaverse that looks less like Ready Player One and more like Her. That is to say, audio-based. We are decades or centuries away from being able to do everything we need to do in the virtual world, which means that we will still need to spend plenty of time in the physical world. During much of that time, we will plug in via audio. Today, Americans spend four hours per day listening to audio, including one hour of spoken word content. Tomorrow, we will listen to even more, as the lines between conversation and entertainment blur. Spotify, of which Tencent owns 9%, is best positioned to capture that earshare. Spotify currently has 286 million monthly active users and is proving out its ability to deliver them different types of audio content beyond music, including podcasts, and soon, audiobooks. According to CEO Daniel Ek, Spotify has 10-15x growth ahead of it. As I wrote in Earshare, it is investing heavily today to ensure that it owns consumersxe2x80x99 ears as audio grows. In the Metaverse, Spotify will fill the space between - when people are not fully immersed in the digital world, they will be able to continue the conversation with friends who are, interact lightly with AR through audio, or just relax and listen to some music. At 10x where it is today, Tencentxe2x80x99s investment in Spotify would be worth $35 billion.Internet: WeChatTencentxe2x80x99s core asset today is WeChat. As we discussed in Part I, Chinese consumers do everything on WeChat - message, read the news, shop digitally, interact with businesses, communicate for work, pay for things in the real world, and more. With the launch of its Mini Programs, companies are able to build richer experiences within the WeChat ecosystem. In some ways, WeChat is a mini, 2D Metaverse. As Tencent quietly orchestrates the adoption of the Metaverse via its minority investments, it will be interesting to watch how much inspiration the Metaverse takes from the WeChat ecosystem. Snap has already started to look more like WeChat with the launch of its own Minis, and the super appxe2x80x99s influence will continue to shape the way that we build new digital economies.Infrastructure and Smart RetailTencent already owns stakes in the platforms of the future, and it has more cash to spend. The company said that it will invest $70 billion in infrastructure including cloud, AI, cybersecurity, blockchain, 5G, and quantum computing over the next five years. It will also be investing heavily in Smart Retail, further bridging the gap between digital and physical retail through payments and other shopping tech. Together, its infrastructure and Smart Retail investments will help build more of the underlying technology and connective tissue the Metaverse will need. Taken together, Tencent owns stakes in the leading companies building the Platforms on which the Metaverse will be built: VR, AR, Audio, and Internet. Epic, Snap, Spotify, and WeChat are all building true platforms -- on which the majority of the profit is made by creators. For the Metaverse to be interesting enough for people to adopt, creators are key. There need to be games to play, music to listen to, rich social experiences, ways to make money, and things to buy with that money. In other words, there needs to be Content. Tencentxe2x80x99s Platform investments enable content creation, and it also invests in Content creators. Capital and Traffic for the next wave. When you lay Tencentxe2x80x99s investments on top of Geffenxe2x80x99s graphic, its Content play emerges. Tencent owns stakes in four of the companies that Geffen included in his original  graphic (circled in blue): Snap, Discord, Roblox, and Epic. Ixe2x80x99ve added more of Tencentxe2x80x99s holdings to the chart to show that Tencent is already a leader in three of the Minimum Viable Metaverse categories, which are the early Content layer: Games, Premium Social Media, and Democratized Ecommerce. Virtual Worlds and Spatial Software (i.e. Games)Games are the first Metaverse Content that many people will engage with, and Tencent is the leading video game company in the world. Its online games segment did $5.5 billion in Q2 revenue, more than any other company.It owns Riot Games, which makes League of Legends, the most popular esports title in the world by over 4x as judged by Twitch streams and 40% of Epic Games, which makes Fortnite (350 million players). Unreal Engine is Platform, Fortnite is Content. It owns 1.5% of Roblox, which has 164 million users and is played by half of people under age 16 in the United States.Matthew Ball talks about games as the xe2x80x9con-rampxe2x80x9d experience for the Metaverse, the thing that will get early adopters to try it out. Tencent owns that on-ramp, and the titles that will keep people engaged and immersed in early versions of the Metaverse. Democratization of Ecommerce For the Metaverse to become more than just an immersive game environment, it will need to support a functioning economy. For that to happen, people will need to be able to sell things in the Metaverse, which is to say, in a seamless way across the digital and physical worlds. Try on a shirt with AR, buy a digital version for your avatar, and have the physical version shipped to your door. Tencent owns stakes in some of the leading ecommerce companies in the world, many of which xe2x80x9carm the rebelsxe2x80x9d instead of vertically integrating, with publicly stated plans to add more:WeChat allows companies to easily set up stores and experiences that reach over a billion customers, and WeChat Pay lets people buy things online or in the real world. Paystack powers digital payments in Africa, Khatabook does the same in India, as do Gojek in Indonesia and SeaMoney in Singapore. Seamless payments will be crucial to power Metaverse stores. Pinduoduoxe2x80x99s Customer-to-Merchant and social commerce models are reshaping ecommerce in ways that may work even better in the Metaverse than they do on mobile. Tencentxe2x80x99s current portfolio and future investments in Smart Retail will continue to blur the lines between digital and physical shopping. They will be crucial in defining the shape of the Metaverse economy, and its assets stand to benefit from the Capital and Traffic Flywheel across its Metaverse Platforms. Premium Social MediaThe Metaverse will let friends, family, and colleagues from across the world gather in immersive environments even more easily than walking next door. It will also let strangers with shared interests find and engage with each other.Tencent has an impressive portfolio of Premium Social companies: Tencent owns 50.1% of Huya and and 38% of Douyu, Chinaxe2x80x99s versions of Amazonxe2x80x99s game streaming product, Twitch. Game streaming mechanics may underpin broadcast activities beyond gaming.Discord, of which Tencent owns ~2%, bills itself as a xe2x80x9cplace to talk and hang out.xe2x80x9d It represents a proto-version of persistent hangouts in the Metaverse.Snap is both a Platform and a Content play, and is a more intimate social network in which young users mainly interact with their closest friends instead of strangers.Tencent owns ~5% of Indian education platform, Byjuxe2x80x99s, the most valuable online learning company in the world.Like a party or a new social network, people will only hang out in the Metaverse if their friends are there. As the Metaverse comes into focus, these Premium social communities will continue to merge with the other aspects like ecommerce and gaming, making many of the things we do more social. Wexe2x80x99ll go to the mall, movies, or concerts with friends, just like the real world pre-Corona. Through its Capital and Traffic approach, Tencent has built a portfolio of internal and external products, platforms, and services that perfectly position it to own the Platforms on which the Metaverse is built, and the Content with which Metaverse users will engage to play, build communities, learn, and shop. So what is it missing? The one area from Geffenxe2x80x99s map in which Tencent is underweight is xe2x80x9cdecentralized, distributed, and remote productivity tech,xe2x80x9d particularly compared to Metaverse competitors Microsoft and Google. Assuming that remote productivity will be an increasingly important component of the Metaverse, I expect that remote productivity tech will be a main area of focus for Tencent in addition to previously announced infrastructure and Smart Retail plays. If I were doing corp dev at Tencent, here are a few companies I would be interested in: Figma. The collaborative design tool that I use to make all of the beautiful graphics in Not Boring would be a strong addition to the portfolio because it is both a work collaboration tool and a potential on-ramp for people to design new worlds and experiences in the Metaverse. People use Figma to synchronously co-create shared environments, like WFH Town.Agora. Tencent brazenly copied Zoom with VooV, which it launched in 100 countries on March 20th. Agora, which went public in June, allows anyone to embed video or voice in their applications. I think that the future of video will look more like use-case specific video environments versus everyone using Zoom, and Agora is both a good way to play that trend and a way for Tencent to spread into thousands of products as a Platform.  Zapier. When I wrote that Google should acquire Slack, Schlaf replied that Zapier is more strategic because xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s plumbing and glue. It ties together a whole ecosystem of applications, services, and developers.xe2x80x9d In a Metaverse defined by the connection among platforms, worlds, and content, its connective plumbing may be even more important. Remix Machines. In The Generalist, Mario Gabriele cited a wave of products unbundling the Microsoft Office Suite with slicker UI and more collaboration. Many of the companies he discusses, like Notion, Coda, Roam, Airtable, Causal, Canva, Projector, Kapwing, and Webflow are well-suited for the Metaverse, which will be largely multiplayer as opposed to one-to-one or solo. Many of these companies are too early in their lives and their trajectories are too steep for them to sell to one of the American tech giants that would swallow them whole. Tencentxe2x80x99s more passive investment approach is likely preferable to the companies. Within the Tencent portfolio, they can get access to capital, traffic, and a seat in the early Metaverse. Tencentxe2x80x99s success in the Metaverse is not a foregone conclusion for three reasons: Government. Tencent is a Chinese company, and the Trump Administration recently issued an Executive Order to prevent people in the US from using WeChat, which the Administration views as a security threat. Were Tencent to take a leading position in the Metaverse the government would very likely intervene. This is one of the areas where Tencentxe2x80x99s structure is advantageous. Itxe2x80x99s impossible to imagine the American government (or Indian government, or many other governments) allowing its citizens to spend the majority of their waking hours in the Metaverse by Tencentxe2x84xa2xefxb8x8f, but it will be harder to prevent people from spending time playing Fortnite or League of Legends, interacting with the world through Snapxe2x80x99s AR, or listening to music on Spotify. Even still, world governments could force Tencent to divest ownership in businesses operating in their countries. Even the Chinese government has been an impediment to Tencentxe2x80x99s dream when it imposed restrictions on in-game purchases in 2018, driving Tencentxe2x80x99s stock down 20%. Competition. Tencent will face opposition from bigger competitors and new entrants alike who have their own designs on controlling the next big platform shift. Facebook bought Oculus to own VR. Microsoft owns Minecraft and the Hololens, and may own TikTok, which is already stealing attention from Tencentxe2x80x99s properties. Google is gunning for cloud gaming with Stadia and wonxe2x80x99t give up its place as the home page for the internet easily. Amazon is the worldxe2x80x99s largest ecommerce business and its largest cloud provider, owns Twitch, and is the best of the bunch at developing new business lines. Apple is currently engaged in a battle with Epic over its 30% app store fee, and has shown that it is willing to play hardball to hold on to its hard-won place in the content ecosystem. The Metaverse is Uncertain and Likely Distributed. Ultimately, no one company will own the Metaverse, and itxe2x80x99s important for Tencent to work with competitors, as Epic has done, in order to maintain its advantage. It will have to convince the other major tech companies that accelerating the arrival of the Metaverse will be positive sum for all of them, and then work arm-in-arm with competitors to convince regulators across the world that what theyxe2x80x99re building, and how theyxe2x80x99re building it, is good for society. Despite the obstacles, investing in Tencent is the best way to invest in the Metaverse. It is the only way for you and I to invest in Epic, which many believe to be the most important Metaverse builder. If it ends up being more AR than VR, Snap will do well. If audio plays a larger role, Spotify will do well. If it blends multiple media, all three will boom together. Even if another giant or startup builds the infrastructure, many of its Content plays stand to benefit from a richer digital / physical economy. If Tencent can nudge its portfolio companies to work together, it will accelerate the Metaversexe2x80x99s development and solidify its own leading role. Even if it canxe2x80x99t, many of its bets stand to perform well independently, and the likelihood of one or more massive winners is high.And if the Metaverse doesnxe2x80x99t emerge at all? If we continue to use the internet in the way we do today for the next century? Tencent owns a portfolio of companies that stand to benefit from the simple straight line continuation of existing trends towards more gaming, ecommerce, audio, digital communication, and digital healthcare. The more we do online, the better Tencent does. This feels like the kind of opportunity that most of us missed to buy a basket of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft in the early 2000s, buffeted by a massive, profitable, and growing core business. Ultimately, Tencent is an undervalued portfolio of many of todayxe2x80x99s top internet assets and a free call option on a new world.Thatxe2x80x99s all for this week, see you on Thursday!Thanks for reading, PackyFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Packy - do you have a take on last Tuesday's China's SAMR release of draft guidelines for \"preventing and stopping monopolistic behavior in the platform economy\" (link at bottom) and it's potential impact on Tencent's business?

Ixe2x80x99m going to try the latter today with a short summary of the essay in slide form. You can check it out here, and Ixe2x80x99d love to hear your thoughts. Tencent's Dream PresentationIn Part I, we covered Tencentxe2x80x99s history, its current businesses, and its massive portfolio of investments. Tencent is undervalued based on its current operating businesses and the current value of its portfolio alone. But Tencentxe2x80x99s positioning for the future is even more compelling, and thatxe2x80x99s what wexe2x80x99re going to discuss in Part II today. Full Disclosure: I own shares in Tencent after doing research on it for this two-parter.Letxe2x80x99s get to it.Tencentxe2x80x99s critics argue that it gave up on its dreams by focusing on investing instead of product innovation. I disagree. Instead of building any specific product, Tencent is building an organization and ecosystem designed to be massively profitable in the short-term with asymmetric upside.Through its investments, Tencent is in the best position of any company to usher in and profit from the Metaverse, the misunderstood and potentially mega-lucrative evolution of the internet. Ixe2x80x99m not the first person to realize that Tencent is in the lead. In his recent Invest Like the Best interview, investor Matthew Ball said, xe2x80x9cSo if you said xe2x80x98who is closest to the Metaverse today?xe2x80x99 the simple answer is not Fortnite or Minecraft, itxe2x80x99s Tencent.xe2x80x9d But Tencentxe2x80x99s advantage extends beyond its lead position in gaming, because the Metaverse will be so much more than games. Look closely at Tencentxe2x80x99s portfolio and youxe2x80x99ll find a group of companies across gaming, ecommerce, and social that will bring the Metaverse to fruition and share in its massive upside. Tencentxe2x80x99s structure and strategy -- provide capital and traffic -- is the perfect model to profit from the decentralized, competitive, creator-friendly ecosystem that the Metaverse is likely to be.Thatxe2x80x99s a big claim, so herexe2x80x99s what wexe2x80x99ll cover to get there:The Metaverse. What the Metaverse is, which parts of it are here already, and how big the opportunity is.Tencentxe2x80x99s Strategy. Instead of building everything itself, Tencent invests. Its Capital + Traffic Flywheel is a smart way to bet on the Metaverse because while technologists are nearly certain that it will exist, no one knows exactly what form it will take. Platform + Content. The Metaverse will comprise the Platforms on top of which itxe2x80x99s built and Content that users interact with for entertainment, socializing, learning, and commerce. Tencent owns leading Platform candidates - Epicxe2x80x99s Unreal Engine (VR), Snap (AR), Spotify (Audio), and WeChat (internet / super app) - plus companies through which people will play, shop, learn, and socialize.Where Tencent Might Invest Next. Tencent has announced its intention to invest in infrastructure and xe2x80x9cSmart Retail,xe2x80x9d and it is likely to invest in remote work and collaboration products like Figma and Agora to round out its business offering.Obstacles. Tencent faces government regulation and well-resourced competitors. This post is fun speculation combined with practical implications. Tencentxe2x80x99s valuation doesnxe2x80x99t properly price the Metaverse opportunity -- it canxe2x80x99t, itxe2x80x99s so early and so speculative -- which means that with Tencent, you get a business that is undervalued today and a free call option on the future. I want you to leave this post with a better understanding of the Metaverse, and an appreciation for the opportunity that Tencent has to make it a reality and profit from its rise. Oh no, not another Metaverse thinkpiecexe2x80xa6 Hear me out. The term, first introduced by sci-fi author Neal Stevenson in his 1992 Snow Crash, makes the idea sound silly and game-like. It sounds a little like talking about the World Wide Web in the early 1990xe2x80x99s. Like the Web back then, the Metaverse is an important idea in need of a rebrand.So what is it?In The Metaverse, Matthew Ball says the Metaverse will be an always-on, real-time world in which an unlimited number of people can participate at the same time. It will have a fully functioning economy and span the physical and digital worlds. Data, digital items, content, and intellectual property (xe2x80x9cIPxe2x80x9d) will work across the Metaverse, and many people and companies will create the content, stores, and experiences that populate it.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney agrees, adding, xe2x80x9cit will be a massively participatory medium of a type that we really havenxe2x80x99t seen yet,xe2x80x9d with xe2x80x9c a fair economy in which all creators can participate, make money and be rewarded.xe2x80x9dThe Metaverse sounds a lot like the real world, layered with digital components at varying degrees of immersion. A participant might walk through a virtual mall and buy a digital Mickey Mouse costume in the Disney store for his avatar to wear, then pop over to the food court to pick something to eat to be delivered to his physical house via Uber Eats, and then pop into a live Beatles concert in the Spotify Performing Arts Center. He can keep the concert going in his AirPods on Spotify when he wants to go for a run in the physical world, racing against his friends in an AR Peloton-like experience.  The whole thing feels seamless - his data and purchases carry across and among physical and digital worlds.Ball, Sweeney, and everyone else Ixe2x80x99ve read on the topic agree: the Metaverse wonxe2x80x99t happen overnight. There wonxe2x80x99t be a clearly demarcated xe2x80x9cbefore the Metaversexe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cafter the Metaversexe2x80x9d divide, and it wonxe2x80x99t be built and run by one company. The Metaverse will be the result of the evolutionary convergence of many separate tools, platforms, and worlds underpinned by shared infrastructure, standards, and protocols. In fact, Marc Geffen makes the case that the Minimum Viable Metaverse is already here in games, the democratization of ecommerce, the rise of xe2x80x9cpremiumxe2x80x9d social media, and the adoption of decentralized, distributed, and remote productivity tech. The Metaverse wonxe2x80x99t be any one thing. Itxe2x80x99s not just one big video game. Itxe2x80x99s not just Second Life. Itxe2x80x99s not just a huge shopping mall. Itxe2x80x99s not the scene from Wall-E that I like to include whenever I talk about the future.Itxe2x80x99s all of those things, and the connections between them, and more. The Metaverse will be a way to blend the physical and digital worlds while allowing us to be fully present in either - itxe2x80x99s the real world, AR, VR, and the internet all rolled into one. With regards to Tencentxe2x80x99s business, three things are important to realize about the Metaverse: The Metaverse isnxe2x80x99t science fiction, itxe2x80x99s an inevitability even if its final form is unclear. Games and game engines are important, but theyxe2x80x99re just one piece of the puzzle. Owning large swaths of the Content and Platforms underpinning the Metaverse and of the content and commerce taking place within it will be highly lucrative.Ball believes that even in a conservative case, the Metaverse will be worth trillions of dollars. But itxe2x80x99s impossible to quantify, like trying to predict how big the xe2x80x9cnetxe2x80x9d was going to be back in the early 1990s. We knew it was going to happen, and we knew that it was going to be big, but we couldnxe2x80x99t have imagined exactly what it would look like, or that it would spawn multiple trillion dollar companies and many more multi-billion dollar ones.While we canxe2x80x99t know the exact what or how, the Metaverse represents an unprecedented wealth creation opportunity. And Tencent, through its investments and consolidated assets, is in the driverxe2x80x99s seat. Which brings us back to Tencentxe2x80x99s dreams. A strategic decision nine years ago accidentally set Tencent up to create more value from the Metaverse than it does from its entire core business by focusing on investment over organic growth.After reading Part I, Rui Ma pointed me to the Tech Buzz China podcast in which she and Ying Lu discuss Pan Luanxe2x80x99s 2018 piece titled xe2x80x9cTencent Has No Dreams.xe2x80x9d In it, he argues that a 2011 decision at a management team offsite caused Tencent to lose sight of its product-focused roots. Back in 2011, Baidu passed Tencent as the most valuable tech company in China, and Pony Ma called a meeting of his top management to chart a new course for the company. In the meeting, dubbed xe2x80x9cThe Conference of the Gods,xe2x80x9d he asked his 16 top executives to list out Tencentxe2x80x99s core competitive advantages. Two winners emerged: capital and traffic. Led by President Martin Lau and his former Goldman colleague James Mitchell, who he brought on as Chief Strategy Officer, Tencent built its strategy on this flywheel of capital and traffic. Attract companies to build on its platform with huge traffic, invest in the winners, give them more traffic, invest more or acquire the winners, generate more traffic, attract more companies, and so on. It runs essentially the same playbook with foreign companies who want access to China.The strategy seems to be working. Since that 2011 meeting, Tencentxe2x80x99s stock has increased nearly 15x, from $44.5 billion to $660 billion. Luan warned, though, that xe2x80x9cHidden behind the ten-fold increase in market value is the investment banking thinking that focuses too much on short-term ROI.xe2x80x9d He cites the fact that Tencent missed out on short-term video, kills internal projects quickly based on ROI calculations, and failed to internationalize WeChat. Luan also argues that Tencentxe2x80x99s intolerance of failure leads to a lack of innovation and talent development, painting the picture of Tencent as a place where, xe2x80x9cSmart people just make PowerPoints and quarrel with each other.xe2x80x9d Luanxe2x80x99s argument boils down to one thatxe2x80x99s familiar to the American tech giants: they canxe2x80x99t innovate anymore, so they just copy and acquire. Facebookxe2x80x99s internal projects are flops, so it acquired Instagram and Oculus and WhatsApp and copied Snap Stories. Google canxe2x80x99t create anything new beyond search (remember Google+??), so it acquired Android and YouTube and DoubleClick. But Tencentxe2x80x99s focus on investment over organic innovation is really smart for two reasons. First, building a startup is an exercise in innovation; running a large company is an exercise in capital allocation (recall The Outsiders). At this point, Tencent creating all of its own products would actually be inefficient. The companyxe2x80x99s best minds should be focused on building an organization and ecosystem that sets it up to catch the next major wave of growth. Second, investment versus full ownership is the right way to play the Metaverse opportunity. If the Metaverse is going to be decentralized and more profits will accrue to creators, it makes financial sense to spread bets across both platforms and content creators instead of trying to build one central platform, like a WeChat version of the Metaverse. Historically, Tencent has evolved its approach to meet evolving tech trends. It launched QQ to capitalize on the rise of the internet in China and it built WeChat to ride the mobile wave. Now itxe2x80x99s building a portfolio of companies that position it to profit from the shift that has the potential to create more economic value than either of the previous two. There are two big components of the Metaverse: Platform (where) and Content (what). Tencent owns stakes in more of the components of each than any company in the world. The magic of the Metaverse is that it will seamlessly integrate the myriad platforms on which we socialize, work, and consume - merging Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), audio, the internet, and the physical world. Tencent owns key players in each, including Epic, Snap, Spotify, WeChat, and even physical retail. VR: Epic (Unreal Engine)In Tencentxe2x80x99s Metaverse solar system, Epic is the sun. In many ways, its major title, Fortnite, is the closest thing we have to the Metaverse today. Looks Like the Metaverse We Think Of: Itxe2x80x99s a persistent, synchronous, live virtual world, complete with shared group experiences like the Travis Scott concert.IP Melting Pot: Competing IP co-exists in Fortnite - you can buy both Marvel and DC skins, NFL jerseys and Jordan sneakers, or be John Wick or Ariana Grande (link)Cross-Platform: Players can play against each other on competing consoles or platforms - players on Mac, Playstation, Xbox, and Android can all play against each other.Participatory: In Creative Mode, players can build their own worlds, and Epic has partnered with creators from the community to develop and sell their skins. Epic is running the Traffic side of the Tencent playbook - because all of the players are on Fortnite, it can get consumer-friendly deals out of parties -- like IP holders and game console makers -- that others cannot. Fortnite is just a trial run for a bigger prize, though. It puts Epicxe2x80x99s Unreal Engine in the prime position to become the Platform on top of which many of the virtual components of the Metaverse are built. Game developers, filmmakers, and architects alike use its Unreal Engine to build rich, immersive digital renderings and worlds. Popular game Gears of War, Disney+ hit The Mandalorian, and leading architects Foster + Partners and Gensler all build with Unreal. A shopping mall designed in Unreal Engine, SourceAs more games, movies, cities, and buildings are built on the same engine, it becomes easier to stitch together a full virtual world. And more will build with Unreal and Epic, because the company is practically giving away its best-in-class tools for free. Epic has the lowest store fees of its competitors (12%), the most publisher-friendly publishing tools, and the most open ecosystem. If a competitor wants to work with Epic, Epic will work with it. Epic does all of this in service of the creators, large and small, who it sees as crucial to pulling the Metaverse forward in time, and to creating a massive Total Addressable Market. The more money creators can make, the thinking goes, the more likely they are to create, the more attractive it will be for users to spend time in the Metaverse, and the more lucrative it will be to be the engine building the Metaverse.Tencent owns 40% of Epic, which recently raised at a $17.3 billion valuation, and looking 10-20 years into the future, that 40% stake could be worth more than all of Tencent today. But itxe2x80x99s just one component of Tencentxe2x80x99s Metaverse Platform play. Another crucially important piece is Snap. AR: SnapTencent is Snapxe2x80x99s largest shareholder, with 12% ownership (although no outside investor has voting rights or control). If Epic is a leading contender to build the virtual world components of the Metaverse, Snap is a leading contender to build the AR components, or Mirrorworld. As I wrote in Oh Snap!:Mirrorworld, according to Kelly, wonxe2x80x99t take place in Virtual Reality (VR), but rather in Augmented Reality (AR). It will blend digital and physical, layering bitsxe2x80x99 infinite possibilities on top of atomsxe2x80x99 realness. Snap is employing the Amazon xe2x80x9cFirst and Best Customerxe2x80x9d strategy. It builds products for its own app first - like Lenses, its first AR hit - and then opens up the tools to both its community to create within Snapchat, and third-party developers to incorporate Snapchatxe2x80x99s features into third-party apps. Snap is building a wide-ranging set of products that build off of each other and work together to lead to a future in which Snap powers the Mirrorworld.Herexe2x80x99s a glimpse from Snapxe2x80x99s Partner Summit:Like Epic, Snap isnxe2x80x99t building a closed ecosystem. Itxe2x80x99s building the tools that others can use to build and profit from AR experiences, inside or outside of the Snapchat product, so that it becomes the platform on top of which developers build the Mirrorworld. Camera Kit: Gives any developer the power of Snapxe2x80x99s Camera, the most widely used piece of AR technology in the world. Bitmoji: Snap owns Bitmoji, which gives everyone their own personalized avatar to use within Snap Games and Minis, and across many external apps, platforms, and OSxe2x80x99s. Snap Kit: Powers 20 of the top 100 apps in the iOS and Google app stores. Local Lenses: Allow users and businesses to build digital worlds on top of the physical one. Snap will be a leader in AR and continue to grow as its user base matures, which will put it among the tech giants in terms of valuation. Today, itxe2x80x99s valued at 1/70th of Apple and 1/30th of Google. If it catches up to where the tech giants are today, Tencentxe2x80x99s stake will be worth over $100 billion. (Insert $100 billion in 10 years meme here)Audio: SpotifyTherexe2x80x99s a version of the Metaverse that looks less like Ready Player One and more like Her. That is to say, audio-based. We are decades or centuries away from being able to do everything we need to do in the virtual world, which means that we will still need to spend plenty of time in the physical world. During much of that time, we will plug in via audio. Today, Americans spend four hours per day listening to audio, including one hour of spoken word content. Tomorrow, we will listen to even more, as the lines between conversation and entertainment blur. Spotify, of which Tencent owns 9%, is best positioned to capture that earshare. Spotify currently has 286 million monthly active users and is proving out its ability to deliver them different types of audio content beyond music, including podcasts, and soon, audiobooks. According to CEO Daniel Ek, Spotify has 10-15x growth ahead of it. As I wrote in Earshare, it is investing heavily today to ensure that it owns consumersxe2x80x99 ears as audio grows. In the Metaverse, Spotify will fill the space between - when people are not fully immersed in the digital world, they will be able to continue the conversation with friends who are, interact lightly with AR through audio, or just relax and listen to some music. At 10x where it is today, Tencentxe2x80x99s investment in Spotify would be worth $35 billion.Internet: WeChatTencentxe2x80x99s core asset today is WeChat. As we discussed in Part I, Chinese consumers do everything on WeChat - message, read the news, shop digitally, interact with businesses, communicate for work, pay for things in the real world, and more. With the launch of its Mini Programs, companies are able to build richer experiences within the WeChat ecosystem. In some ways, WeChat is a mini, 2D Metaverse. As Tencent quietly orchestrates the adoption of the Metaverse via its minority investments, it will be interesting to watch how much inspiration the Metaverse takes from the WeChat ecosystem. Snap has already started to look more like WeChat with the launch of its own Minis, and the super appxe2x80x99s influence will continue to shape the way that we build new digital economies.Infrastructure and Smart RetailTencent already owns stakes in the platforms of the future, and it has more cash to spend. The company said that it will invest $70 billion in infrastructure including cloud, AI, cybersecurity, blockchain, 5G, and quantum computing over the next five years. It will also be investing heavily in Smart Retail, further bridging the gap between digital and physical retail through payments and other shopping tech. Together, its infrastructure and Smart Retail investments will help build more of the underlying technology and connective tissue the Metaverse will need. Taken together, Tencent owns stakes in the leading companies building the Platforms on which the Metaverse will be built: VR, AR, Audio, and Internet. Epic, Snap, Spotify, and WeChat are all building true platforms -- on which the majority of the profit is made by creators. For the Metaverse to be interesting enough for people to adopt, creators are key. There need to be games to play, music to listen to, rich social experiences, ways to make money, and things to buy with that money. In other words, there needs to be Content. Tencentxe2x80x99s Platform investments enable content creation, and it also invests in Content creators. Capital and Traffic for the next wave. When you lay Tencentxe2x80x99s investments on top of Geffenxe2x80x99s graphic, its Content play emerges. Tencent owns stakes in four of the companies that Geffen included in his original  graphic (circled in blue): Snap, Discord, Roblox, and Epic. Ixe2x80x99ve added more of Tencentxe2x80x99s holdings to the chart to show that Tencent is already a leader in three of the Minimum Viable Metaverse categories, which are the early Content layer: Games, Premium Social Media, and Democratized Ecommerce. Virtual Worlds and Spatial Software (i.e. Games)Games are the first Metaverse Content that many people will engage with, and Tencent is the leading video game company in the world. Its online games segment did $5.5 billion in Q2 revenue, more than any other company.It owns Riot Games, which makes League of Legends, the most popular esports title in the world by over 4x as judged by Twitch streams and 40% of Epic Games, which makes Fortnite (350 million players). Unreal Engine is Platform, Fortnite is Content. It owns 1.5% of Roblox, which has 164 million users and is played by half of people under age 16 in the United States.Matthew Ball talks about games as the xe2x80x9con-rampxe2x80x9d experience for the Metaverse, the thing that will get early adopters to try it out. Tencent owns that on-ramp, and the titles that will keep people engaged and immersed in early versions of the Metaverse. Democratization of Ecommerce For the Metaverse to become more than just an immersive game environment, it will need to support a functioning economy. For that to happen, people will need to be able to sell things in the Metaverse, which is to say, in a seamless way across the digital and physical worlds. Try on a shirt with AR, buy a digital version for your avatar, and have the physical version shipped to your door. Tencent owns stakes in some of the leading ecommerce companies in the world, many of which xe2x80x9carm the rebelsxe2x80x9d instead of vertically integrating, with publicly stated plans to add more:WeChat allows companies to easily set up stores and experiences that reach over a billion customers, and WeChat Pay lets people buy things online or in the real world. Paystack powers digital payments in Africa, Khatabook does the same in India, as do Gojek in Indonesia and SeaMoney in Singapore. Seamless payments will be crucial to power Metaverse stores. Pinduoduoxe2x80x99s Customer-to-Merchant and social commerce models are reshaping ecommerce in ways that may work even better in the Metaverse than they do on mobile. Tencentxe2x80x99s current portfolio and future investments in Smart Retail will continue to blur the lines between digital and physical shopping. They will be crucial in defining the shape of the Metaverse economy, and its assets stand to benefit from the Capital and Traffic Flywheel across its Metaverse Platforms. Premium Social MediaThe Metaverse will let friends, family, and colleagues from across the world gather in immersive environments even more easily than walking next door. It will also let strangers with shared interests find and engage with each other. Tencent has an impressive portfolio of Premium Social companies: Tencent owns 50.1% of Huya and and 38% of Douyu, Chinaxe2x80x99s versions of Amazonxe2x80x99s game streaming product, Twitch. Game streaming mechanics may underpin broadcast activities beyond gaming.Discord, of which Tencent owns ~2%, bills itself as a xe2x80x9cplace to talk and hang out.xe2x80x9d It represents a proto-version of persistent hangouts in the Metaverse.Snap is both a Platform and a Content play, and is a more intimate social network in which young users mainly interact with their closest friends instead of strangers.Tencent owns ~5% of Indian education platform, Byjuxe2x80x99s, the most valuable online learning company in the world.Like a party or a new social network, people will only hang out in the Metaverse if their friends are there. As the Metaverse comes into focus, these Premium social communities will continue to merge with the other aspects like ecommerce and gaming, making many of the things we do more social. Wexe2x80x99ll go to the mall, movies, or concerts with friends, just like the real world pre-Corona. Through its Capital and Traffic approach, Tencent has built a portfolio of internal and external products, platforms, and services that perfectly position it to own the Platforms on which the Metaverse is built, and the Content with which Metaverse users will engage to play, build communities, learn, and shop. So what is it missing? The one area from Geffenxe2x80x99s map in which Tencent is underweight is xe2x80x9cdecentralized, distributed, and remote productivity tech,xe2x80x9d particularly compared to Metaverse competitors Microsoft and Google. Assuming that remote productivity will be an increasingly important component of the Metaverse, I expect that remote productivity tech will be a main area of focus for Tencent in addition to previously announced infrastructure and Smart Retail plays. If I were doing corp dev at Tencent, here are a few companies I would be interested in: Figma. The collaborative design tool that I use to make all of the beautiful graphics in Not Boring would be a strong addition to the portfolio because it is both a work collaboration tool and a potential on-ramp for people to design new worlds and experiences in the Metaverse. People use Figma to synchronously co-create shared environments, like WFH Town.Agora. Tencent brazenly copied Zoom with VooV, which it launched in 100 countries on March 20th. Agora, which went public in June, allows anyone to embed video or voice in their applications. I think that the future of video will look more like use-case specific video environments versus everyone using Zoom, and Agora is both a good way to play that trend and a way for Tencent to spread into thousands of products as a Platform.  Zapier. When I wrote that Google should acquire Slack, Schlaf replied that Zapier is more strategic because xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s plumbing and glue. It ties together a whole ecosystem of applications, services, and developers.xe2x80x9d In a Metaverse defined by the connection among platforms, worlds, and content, its connective plumbing may be even more important. Remix Machines. In The Generalist, Mario Gabriele cited a wave of products unbundling the Microsoft Office Suite with slicker UI and more collaboration. Many of the companies he discusses, like Notion, Coda, Roam, Airtable, Causal, Canva, Projector, Kapwing, and Webflow are well-suited for the Metaverse, which will be largely multiplayer as opposed to one-to-one or solo. Many of these companies are too early in their lives and their trajectories are too steep for them to sell to one of the American tech giants that would swallow them whole. Tencentxe2x80x99s more passive investment approach is likely preferable to the companies. Within the Tencent portfolio, they can get access to capital, traffic, and a seat in the early Metaverse. Tencentxe2x80x99s success in the Metaverse is not a foregone conclusion for three reasons: Government. Tencent is a Chinese company, and the Trump Administration recently issued an Executive Order to prevent people in the US from using WeChat, which the Administration views as a security threat. Were Tencent to take a leading position in the Metaverse the government would very likely intervene. This is one of the areas where Tencentxe2x80x99s structure is advantageous. Itxe2x80x99s impossible to imagine the American government (or Indian government, or many other governments) allowing its citizens to spend the majority of their waking hours in the Metaverse by Tencentxe2x84xa2xefxb8x8f, but it will be harder to prevent people from spending time playing Fortnite or League of Legends, interacting with the world through Snapxe2x80x99s AR, or listening to music on Spotify. Even still, world governments could force Tencent to divest ownership in businesses operating in their countries. Even the Chinese government has been an impediment to Tencentxe2x80x99s dream when it imposed restrictions on in-game purchases in 2018, driving Tencentxe2x80x99s stock down 20%. Competition. Tencent will face opposition from bigger competitors and new entrants alike who have their own designs on controlling the next big platform shift. Facebook bought Oculus to own VR. Microsoft owns Minecraft and the Hololens, and may own TikTok, which is already stealing attention from Tencentxe2x80x99s properties. Google is gunning for cloud gaming with Stadia and wonxe2x80x99t give up its place as the home page for the internet easily. Amazon is the worldxe2x80x99s largest ecommerce business and its largest cloud provider, owns Twitch, and is the best of the bunch at developing new business lines. Apple is currently engaged in a battle with Epic over its 30% app store fee, and has shown that it is willing to play hardball to hold on to its hard-won place in the content ecosystem. The Metaverse is Uncertain and Likely Distributed. Ultimately, no one company will own the Metaverse, and itxe2x80x99s important for Tencent to work with competitors, as Epic has done, in order to maintain its advantage. It will have to convince the other major tech companies that accelerating the arrival of the Metaverse will be positive sum for all of them, and then work arm-in-arm with competitors to convince regulators across the world that what theyxe2x80x99re building, and how theyxe2x80x99re building it, is good for society. Despite the obstacles, investing in Tencent is the best way to invest in the Metaverse. It is the only way for you and I to invest in Epic, which many believe to be the most important Metaverse builder. If it ends up being more AR than VR, Snap will do well. If audio plays a larger role, Spotify will do well. If it blends multiple media, all three will boom together. Even if another giant or startup builds the infrastructure, many of its Content plays stand to benefit from a richer digital / physical economy. If Tencent can nudge its portfolio companies to work together, it will accelerate the Metaversexe2x80x99s development and solidify its own leading role. Even if it canxe2x80x99t, many of its bets stand to perform well independently, and the likelihood of one or more massive winners is high.And if the Metaverse doesnxe2x80x99t emerge at all? If we continue to use the internet in the way we do today for the next century? Tencent owns a portfolio of companies that stand to benefit from the simple straight line continuation of existing trends towards more gaming, ecommerce, audio, digital communication, and digital healthcare. The more we do online, the better Tencent does. This feels like the kind of opportunity that most of us missed to buy a basket of Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft in the early 2000s, buffeted by a massive, profitable, and growing core business. Ultimately, Tencent is an undervalued portfolio of many of todayxe2x80x99s top internet assets and a free call option on a new world.

If youxe2x80x99re reading this but havenxe2x80x99t subscribed, join 10,642 smart, curious folks by subscribing here!Hi friends xf0x9fx91x8b,Happy Thursday! On Monday, I wrote Part I of a two-parter about Tencent, the Chinese technology conglomerate with the most popular app in China, the biggest gaming business in the world, and stakes in many of the fastest-growing companies around the globe. I was hopped up on caffeine (see below) and said that I would be writing Part II today. Well, I either overestimated myself, underestimated Tencentxe2x80x99s ambitions, or both. Therexe2x80x99s a really fascinating story to tell about Tencentxe2x80x99s future, and I donxe2x80x99t want to sell it short by rushing it, so Part II will be coming out on Monday. Today, Ixe2x80x99m going to keep it short and to the point. Letxe2x80x99s get to it. TL;DR: Take this 5 minute survey so I can learn more about who you are, what you do, and how I can improve Not Boring.Take the Not Boring SurveyIxe2x80x99ve been writing Not Boring (and Per My Last Email) for 15 months now, since May 2019. I didnxe2x80x99t set out to write a newsletter full time, but this has been so much more fun than I expected, so here we are. On May 21st, I sent out an email with three goals to 1,294 people: Grow to 5,000 subscribers by Labor Day and 10,000 by May 21, 2021. Build an ecosystem of smart, talented people participating in various ways. Make enough money from the newsletter to cover rent.  xe2x9cx85 Wexe2x80x99ve blown goal #1 out of the water, hitting the May 2021 10k goal a solid nine months early. Thatxe2x80x99s mind-blowing to me and I really appreciate all of you reading, giving me feedback, and sharing Not Boring with your smartest friends. Letxe2x80x99s keep going! Next growth goal: 25k subscribers by the end of 2020 xf0x9fx93x88 Refer Your Friends xe2x9cx85 Wexe2x80x99re well on our way on #2, too. Not Boring has hosted guest posts from really talented writers and operators - Ali Montag, Sid Jha, Jeremy Diamond, Reuben Ogbonna, Marc Geffen, Gil Kazimirov, and Dru Riley, with more great collabs on the way. Tommy and James helped build a shiny landing page and referral program.Ixe2x80x99ve gotten to collaborate with Mario Gabriele on Not Boring Generalists videos and the S-1 Club. Wexe2x80x99ve partnered with the teams at Apt and Composer to tell their stories and raise money - the Not Boring Syndicate raised over $100k for Composer before a lead investor was even in place! If you run an early stage company thatxe2x80x99s raising and has a story to tell, get in touch to discuss whether the Not Boring Syndicate would be a helpful backer:Submit Your Companyxf0x9fx92xb8 That leaves #3: make money so that I can keep doing this! In time, the goal is to turn this into a paid newsletter - I want Not Boring to be both informative and entertaining enough that youxe2x80x99re excited to pay for it. But going paid would mean slowing growth, and wexe2x80x99re not trying to slow down around here. So I want to start monetizing via sponsorships. In order to do that, I need to know a little bit more about you so I can show off  just how impressive the Not Boring family is to potential sponsors. I put together a short survey to learn a little bit more about you, and to get your feedback on Not Boring so far, and what youxe2x80x99d like to see in the future. It shouldnxe2x80x99t take more than 5 minutes of your time. It would be a huge help if youxe2x80x99d fill it out so I can continue to improve the product, and find sponsors who will be relevant to you to help fuel the improvements. All answers are anonymous!  Take the Not Boring SurveyThanks to Dan, Puja, Tommy, and Jacob Donnelly of the excellent A Media Operator newsletter for their feedback on the survey.If your company is interested in sponsoring Not Boring, reply and letxe2x80x99s chat!Speaking of telling you about products that youxe2x80x99ll lovexe2x80xa6 meet Nguyen Coffee Supply.This is not an ad.

She told me the Robusta beans had 2x the caffeine, but I was skepticalxe2x80xa6 coffee doesnxe2x80x99t really move the needle for me anymore. After one cup, I could legitimately tell the difference. My brain was buzzing. I donxe2x80x99t think itxe2x80x99s a coincidence that the Tencent essay was 1,000 words longer than usual xf0x9fxa4xafSahra offered to give us 10% off by entering NOTBORING10 at checkout. Try it.

No time to rest, though. Todayxe2x80x99s piece is maybe the most ambitious in Not Boring history. I want to celebrate Ten k by going deep on the only company with the right name for the occasion, Tencent.  Tencent is the Chinese conglomerate behind the recently-banned WeChat, and one of the worldxe2x80x99s most successful investment funds. Therexe2x80x99s so much to say about this company that Ixe2x80x99m breaking it up into two parts: Part I (today): Tencentxe2x80x99s history, its business, and its portfolio, including a bonus goody for the investing nerds out there: a link to a spreadsheet I made with the current value of 102 of Tencentxe2x80x99s investments. Part II (Thursday): Part II, covering Tencentxe2x80x99s Metaverse Dreams, is live now!This post isnxe2x80x99t meant to be political or to pass value judgments. Itxe2x80x99s just an assessment of a fascinating company that most of us know far too little about. Favor: if you enjoy this post, please click the little heart button to like it - it helps more people discover my writing - or share it with your most Sinocurious friend. ShareLetxe2x80x99s get to it. Tencent is the most important company that many Americans know the least about. When President Trump signed an August 6th Executive Order banning WeChat from the United States, a lot of people said, xe2x80x9cWhatxe2x80x99s WeChat?xe2x80x9d Even those who knew about WeChat know very little about the octopoid company behind it. Letxe2x80x99s fix that. You should leave this two-part essay with a better understanding of what Tencent does, what it owns, and why itxe2x80x99s one of the most significant companies in the world.The Chinese pager-based internet service that Pony Ma launched in 1998 is now the worldxe2x80x99s seventh most valuable company, right ahead of Berkshire Hathaway and right behind its bitter rival, Alibaba. As of Friday, Tencent is worth $628 billion.In China, Tencent is like Facebook, Nintendo, Shopify, Netflix, Spotify, Slack, and PayPal rolled into one. Its flagship product, WeChat, has 1.2 billion users, and those users spend more time in the app every day than Americans spend on all social media apps combined. People use WeChat to message friends, shop, read the news, play games, pay for things in physical storesxe2x80xa6 pretty anything you can do on your phone, you can do on WeChat. Tencent turned the profits from its social networking, ecommerce, and gaming cash cows into a global investment portfolio that includes many of the worldxe2x80x99s most popular video games, the fastest-growing internet businesses in China, meaningful stakes in Tesla, Spotify, and Snap, and a portfolio of international startup unicorns second only to Sequoiaxe2x80x99s. It even financed A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Americans donxe2x80x99t know much about Tencent because, in addition to being Chinese, itxe2x80x99s really fucking complex. Itxe2x80x99s both one of the most profitable operating businesses in the world and one of the most ambitious investment funds. Tencent has been dubbed xe2x80x9cThe SoftBank of Chinaxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cThe Berkshire Hathaway of Tech.xe2x80x9d Neither description does it justice. While it gets less hype, its performance puts SoftBankxe2x80x99s to shame. Itxe2x80x99s going to be one of the most important companies in the world for decades to come. Today, in Part I, Ixe2x80x99m going to explain Tencent in four sections: What is Tencent? An entrepreneurial story just like the ones you hear in the US, with all of the highs, lows, and near-deaths. An improbable journey from pager-based internet service to the giant holding company it is today.The Outsiders. William N. Thorndikexe2x80x99s 2012 book, The Outsiders, about eight of the most successful CEOs in US history, provides a framework for thinking about Tencentxe2x80x99s business. CEO Pony Ma shares all of the important characteristics with the eight that Thorndike wrote about.Tencentxe2x80x99s Operating Businesses. Tencentxe2x80x99s core business makes money in six main ways, and each of its business units rivals in, both scope and revenue, massive, standalone public companies.Tencentxe2x80x99s Investment Portfolio. Therexe2x80x99s no great public source for all of Tencentxe2x80x99s 700-800 investments, so I created a database of 103 of its biggest and share insights around where it invests, in which types of companies, and the unfair advantages it has as an investor.  The founding stories of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon are canon for the type of people who read Not Boring. Theyxe2x80x99re part of modern American mythology. Itxe2x80x99s time for us to get to know Tencent.Note: Ixe2x80x99ve used Julia Wuxe2x80x99s summary of Wu Xiaoboxe2x80x99s book, Matthew Brennanxe2x80x99s presentations, and the excellent Acquired podcast on Tencent to piece together Tencentxe2x80x99s history. Wexe2x80x99ve been conditioned to think of massive Chinese technology companies as shady, government-controlled businesses out to steal your data and try to take over the world. It might surprise you, then, that Tencent started out like a lot of US startups: as an entrepreneurial itch that one 26-year-old nerd had to scratch with the help of some friends. Ma Huateng was born at the right time and moved to the right place. Ma was born in the Hainan province in 1971 and moved to Shenzhen when he was 13. In the late 1970s, Chinese President Deng Xiaoping designated Shenzhen as a special economic zone as part of his xe2x80x9creform and opening policy.xe2x80x9d Ma, whose family name meant xe2x80x9chorsexe2x80x9d and whose nickname, appropriately, was Pony, grew up in the one capitalist place in communist China. Ma was prodigiously smart. He scored high enough in college entrance exams to go anywhere in the country, but stayed close to home, attending Shenzhen University. The school didnxe2x80x99t have the astronomy major that Ma was most interested in, so he settled for his second choice: computer science. He was a natural. Ma regularly won student hacking contests, and built graphical user interfaces before they were a thing in China. While interning at one of Chinaxe2x80x99s leading tech companies, Ma built a stock market analysis tool with a GUI as a side project, and sold it to his employer for 50,000 Chinese Yuan (CNY), or about 3 yearsxe2x80x99 salary. If this were a novel, the fact that Pony Maxe2x80x99s first product combined tech and finance and his first taste of wealth came from an M&A transaction would be called foreshadowing. After college, Ma spent five years at a pager company, where he was exposed to the latest technology (pagers!) and became a manager. But Ma was living a second life in the early online chatrooms. He joined the growing FidoNet community, participating in and then hosting early internet bulletin board systems, where he met future billionaires like Xiaomixe2x80x99s Lei Jun and NetEasexe2x80x99s Ding Lei. Inspired by Leixe2x80x99s early success with NetEase (which today is worth $65 billion), in 1998, Ma left his job and convinced his friend, Zhang Zhidong, to start a company with him. They planned to combine the internet and pagers, which were popular in China at the time, to build a mobile internet on which people could send email, news, and more. Sticking with Maxe2x80x99s equestrian nomenclature, they named the company Tengxun, which means xe2x80x9cgalloping message.xe2x80x9d Tencent is the anglicized version of Tengxun. As Tencent was building its pager-based internet, Ma noticed the Israeli internet communication tool and Instant Messenger competitor ICQ, which sold to AOL in 1998, and decided to build a version for the Chinese market. Creatively, he called it OICQ, and built distribution and features necessary to serve customers who didnxe2x80x99t own personal computers, but increasingly accessed them in internet cafes. OICQ took off, and Tencent abandoned the pager internet. Users quadrupled every three months. After nine months, OICQ hit one million users. But this was pre-AWS (or Tencent Cloud) and servers were expensive. Plus, AOL sued Tencnent to change OICQxe2x80x99s name. They were running out of money, so Ma launched a dual-track process to either sell the company or raise money. Tencent was aiming for 3 million yuan in a sale ($431k at todayxe2x80x99s exchange rate), but the highest offer it received was for 600k yuan ($86,327). The lack of demand turned out to be a pretty lucky break. Today, itxe2x80x99s worth 1,454,929x its 3 million yuan asking price. With no acquirer, Ma sold 40% of Tencent to early US-based Chinese venture investor IDG Capital and Yingke, a fund led by Chinese billionaire Li Kashingxe2x80x99s son, for $2.2 million. But it wasnxe2x80x99t out of the woods.Soon after, AOL won its lawsuit, forcing Tencent to change the name of its flagship product. It chose QQ. Server costs continued to increase as the company crossed 100 million users with no revenue model. Tencent was back on the market. It approached Chinese search company Sohu and Yahoo! China. Neither was interested. Then, in 2001, the South African firm Naspers (literally) walked in the door and offered to invest at a $60 million valuation. So that Ma didnxe2x80x99t lose majority ownership, IDG sold 12.8% of its 20% and Yingke sold its entire stake for an 11x gain (not bad!), giving Naspers 32.8% of the company for $19.68 million. Today, that investment is worth $205 billion, good for a 10,436x return!With Naspersxe2x80x99 money in the bank, the Tencent team turned its attention to monetization. In 2002, a product manager discovered the Korean company sayclub.com, which monetized by allowing users to create personalized avatars. Tencent built its own version, QQ Show, and within 6 months, the product had 5 million users paying 5 yuan (a little less than $1) per month. As Julia Wu points out, the ability to personalize an avatar was such a hit because under communism, Chinese people had been xe2x80x9cdull and collectivexe2x80x9d in their personal representation. Tencent also launched a xe2x80x9cred diamond membershipxe2x80x9d for 10 yuan per month, for VIP status, monthly virtual gifts, and discounts in the QQ marketplace. This is a really important piece to understand. In the US, as we talked about in If I Ruled the Tweets, social media monetizes through advertising. In Asia, it mainly monetizes through digital gifts, subscriptions, and purchases. To this day, xe2x80x9cValue Added Servicesxe2x80x9d generate more than 3x the revenue for Tencent than xe2x80x9cOnline Advertising.xe2x80x9d Avatars were big business. In 2003, Tencent hit a $100 million run rate and moved beyond messaging by building a portal, like a Chinese AOL. The team also realized that a lot of its users were chatting on QQ while playing games in internet cafes, so it added games to the QQ platform, both by acquiring small studios and building games in-house. Within a year, games added another $50 million in annual revenue. With monetization booming, Tencent IPOxe2x80x99d in 2004  at a valuation of 6.22 billion HKD, or $790 million USD. Cue Motley Fool headline: if you had invested $10,000 in Tencent at its IPO in 2004, you would have $7.9 million today. Oh, you didnxe2x80x99t invest in Tencent at its IPO? Damn. To be fair, itxe2x80x99s a very different company today than it was then, thanks to two 2005 hires: Martin Lau and Allen Zhang.After completing its IPO, Tencent hired the Goldman Sachs investment banker who took it public, Martin Lau. Lau had the pedigree - Chinese-born, undergrad at Michigan, engineering masters at Stanford, and MBA at Kellogg - and a skillset that was complementary to Maxe2x80x99s. Lau became the English-speaking face of the business, taking on a role that the shy Ma hated, and the master capital allocator. In the beginning of his tenure, Lau focused on acquiring studios to grow its scorching games business as the Chief Strategy Officer. By the next year, Ma promoted him to President. Tencent also turned its attention to competitive threats to the portal business, including Microsoftxe2x80x99s increasing presence in China via MSN. To combat the threat, it acquired competitor Foxmail in 2005 to build QQ Mail. The product was successful, but more importantly, Tencent acquired the developer behind Foxmail, Allen Zhang. With Lau and Zhang on board, Tencent grew rapidly via desktop games and the QQ platform. Its revenue jumped 15x from $200 million in 2005 to $2.9 billion in 2010. But 2011 was the year when Zhang and Lau really made their mark. In 2010, early in the rise of mobile, Zhang noticed the popularity of Canadian messaging company called Kik, and convinced Ma to let him build a Chinese version for Tencent. The next seven years changed the trajectory of the company.2011: Working around the clock with a small team, Zhang launched Weixin in January. English speakers know it as WeChat. (Theyxe2x80x99re actually two separate products - Weixin serves Mainland China and WeChat serves the rest of the world, but wexe2x80x99ll refer to the two interchangeably as WeChat.) After early competition with Xiaomixe2x80x99s Mi Chat, WeChat pulled away by tapping into QQxe2x80x99s existing user base, and then launching xe2x80x9cFriends Nearby,xe2x80x9d which was like an early version of Tinder. WeChat began adding 100k users per day.2012: WeChat hit 100 million users. It took 433 days to hit that mark. By comparison, it took QQ ten years, Facebook 5.5 years, and Twitter 4 years. In April, WeChat launched the Moments newsfeed and Official Accounts, allowing publishers to distribute content and businesses to distribute products and services. By the end of the year, it had 300 million users. 2013: Tencent launched WeChat Pay to enable payment through the platform. 2015: WeChat crossed half a billion users. 2017: WeChat launched Mini Programs, allowing businesses to build full-functionality apps within the WeChat platform. Companies like Pinduoduo build on top of WeChat and tap into all of its customersxe2x80x99 existing social and professional networks. Mini Programs turn WeChat into a xe2x80x9csuper app,xe2x80x9d and are the inspiration behind Snap Minis, which we covered in Oh Snap!. WeChat, for all intents and purposes, is the mobile operating system in China.Back to Lau. While Zhang was building WeChat, Lau was busy acquiring games, laying the foundation for the next stage of growth. Two investments in 2011 and 2012 were particularly important. In 2011, Tencent acquired 92.8% of US game studio, Riot Games, creators of League of Legends for $400 million (they acquired the remaining 7.2% in 2015). The next year, in 2012, it acquired 40% of Cary, NC-based game company, Epic Games for $330 million.Today, Epic and Riot are two of the gems in Tencentxe2x80x99s gaming portfolio. League of Legends is a cornerstone of a gaming division that brought in $5.5 billion in Q2 alone. As we will explore in xe2x80x9cTencentxe2x80x99s Future,xe2x80x9d Epic may also be the engine (pun intended) that drives the next massive phase of Tencentxe2x80x99s growth and puts it at the center of a new, virtual world. Over the past decade, Lau and his team have acquired or invested in over 700 companies, funded by the massive pools of cash Tencentxe2x80x99s gaming division and WeChat spit off.WeChat has over 1.2 billions users today. And those users are incredibly engaged. WeChat users in China spend an average of four hours per day in the app, more time than US users spend on all social media apps combined. Chinese users do everything on WeChat. They communicate with friends, co-workers, and clients through WeChat. Businesses communicate with customers through Official Accounts. They can also sell things through those accounts. Thousands of businesses, including ridesharing (Didi) and food delivery (Meituan Dianping), launched on WeChat. Tencent monetizes WeChat mainly through transactions instead of ads.So putting it all together, what is Tencent? Tencent is a Chinese holding company that is the world leader in gaming and runs the largest messaging, social networking, and mobile payments platform in China. It uses the cash flow from those businesses to invest in the next generation of massive companies in China and around the globe. Tencent combines the diversification of an old school conglomerate with the growth and decentralization of an internet-native business into a company that may become the largest in the world.From its roots as a product company, Tencent has become the best capital allocator of any non-investment company in the world. Itxe2x80x99s running The Outsiders playbook to perfection.In 2012, William N. Thorndike unintentionally wrote the guide to understanding Tencentxe2x80x99s dominance: The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.In it, Thorndike explores the things that eight CEOs -- including Warren Buffett, The Washington Postxe2x80x99s Katharine Graham, Teledynexe2x80x99s Henry Singleton, and Capital Citiesxe2x80x99 Tom Murphy -- did differently that made them more successful than their peers.How does he measure success? You really only need to know three things to evaluate a CEOxe2x80x99s greatness: the compound annual return to shareholders during his or her tenure and the return over the same period for peer companies and for the broader market (usually measured by the S&P 500).By that measure, Pony Ma has been one of the worldxe2x80x99s most successful CEOs. Since Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest competitor, Alibaba, went public in September 2014, Tencent has returned 305% versus:182% for Alibaba-48% for Baidu 68%, 141%, and 10% for the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Hang Sen Index, respectively.Over the past six years, Tencent has outperformed the index that tracks the largest companies in Hong Kongxe2x80x99s stock market by 30x.Why has Tencent outperformed? For the same reasons that Thorndike highlighted in The Outsiders eight years ago. Pony Ma and Tencent share the characteristics common among the most successful CEOs, and take some to extremes. Outsider CEOs were private, ran decentralized organizations, and masterfully allocated capital to the opportunities, internal or external, with the highest potential to drive their stockxe2x80x99s performance. Pony Ma is the ultimate Outsider! As a result, hexe2x80x99s now Chinaxe2x80x99s richest man with a net worth of $56.2 billion. And the business that he built is a master class in capital allocation, as wexe2x80x99ll see by breaking Tencent down into its two main businesses, which often interact with each other: Operating Businesses and Investments.Tencentxe2x80x99s core business makes money in six main ways: PaymentsSubscriptions (like video and music)Social adsMedia ads GamesCloudHerexe2x80x99s a breakdown of how revenue maps to business lines from a 2017 presentation by China tech analyst, Matthew Brennan:  All clear? Ok good, moving on. JK, itxe2x80x99s super complex. Letxe2x80x99s break it down by looking at Tencentxe2x80x99s Q2 results, converted to USD:Social Networks. Instead of ads, Social Networks includes Value Added Services revenue like subscriptions for video and music and in-game purchases. It has 114 million paid video subscriptions and 47 million paid music subscriptions. Online Games. Games are Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest business. Tencent has 17 separate franchises that have exceeded 10 million daily active users, not including Epic Gamesxe2x80x99 Fortnite, in which it has a large, non-controlling stake.Online Advertising - Media. It includes ads on Tencent Videoxe2x80x99s properties, as well as in Tencentxe2x80x99s various other digital, news, and video media properties. Online Advertising - Social and Others. This segment looks the most similar to US social media companiesxe2x80x99 monetization. One of the biggest drivers is companies paying for ads in WeChat Moments, and analysts highlight the fact that WeChat still has a relatively light ad load and room to grow.FinTech and Business Services. Tencentxe2x80x99s second largest segment, it includes all of TenPay, the largest online payments platform in China encompassing WeChat Pay and QQ Pay, as well as WeChatxe2x80x99s wealth management business. When consumers and businesses buy from businesses on WeChat, via Official Accounts and Mini Programs, the fee Tencent takes is captured here, as does the fee Tencent takes when people use WeChat Pay to pay offline and across the web. FinTech and Business Services also includes its cloud business. Although it didnxe2x80x99t break cloud revenue out separately in Q2, it was a $2.4 billion business in 2019.To give you a sense for Tencentxe2x80x99s scope and scale, herexe2x80x99s how Tencentxe2x80x99s business lines compare to entire industry-leading companies based on Q2 revenue. Tencentxe2x80x99s Payments business is nearly as big as PayPalxe2x80x99s entire business, and it generated five times as much revenue as Shopify in Q2. Its subscription revenue alone is 62% of Netflixxe2x80x99s. It has some catching up to do in Social Ads, where it generates only 12% as much as the leader, Facebook, although it did generate more than 3x as much social ads revenue as Twitter. Its small media ads business is bigger than the New York Times. Games revenue is 64% higher than the worldxe2x80x99s most valuable standalone gaming company, Nintendo. Breaking cloud out of Payments and Business Services, based on last year ($600 million per quarter), itxe2x80x99s far behind AWS in cloud, with only 6% of the revenue.Itxe2x80x99s difficult to wrap your arms around Tencent, and as a result, the company likely trades at a discount to its more focused American counterparts. If you applied the same Q2 revenue multiples at which each of the businesses in the chart above is currently trading to the corresponding Tencent business segment, its operating businesses alone would be valued at $538 billion, 86% of the companyxe2x80x99s current market cap.And thatxe2x80x99s before you get to the part of Tencentxe2x80x99s business that excites me the most, its expansive portfolio of investments.Did you know that Tencent owns 5% of Tesla, 12% of Snap, and 9% of Spotify (including a stake through Tencent Music)? Those stakes are worth $15.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.2 billion, respectively, and they barely scratch the surface. In The Outsiders, Thorndike wrote, xe2x80x9cCEOs need to do two things well: run their operations efficiently, and deploy the cash generated by those operations.xe2x80x9d In Q2, Tencent generated $5.4 billion in operating profit. Job 1: xe2x9cx85  Itxe2x80x99s how Tencent deploys the cash generated by those operations thatxe2x80x99s so fascinating, though. Two of Pony Maxe2x80x99s top lieutenants, President Martin Lau and Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell, are ex-Goldman bankers. As one VC told the Financial Times: xe2x80x9cWhen you put a basketball player in the room, you know what theyxe2x80x99re going to do. If you hire Goldman Sachs bankers, you know what they are going to do.xe2x80x9dThe analogy is a bit of a stretch, but the answer is clear: theyxe2x80x99re going to do M&A. On its most recent earnings call, Martin Lau said:Our M&A strategy has always been trying to invest in up and coming companies which have a great management, who have innovative products, and at the same time, they have synergies with our existing platforms. We now have more than 700 companies.More than 700 companies!Therexe2x80x99s nowhere online to find all of Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest investments, their ownership stake, and the current value of the investments in one placexe2x80xa6 so I built it. I have only 103 of the 700 investments in there, but I think I have all the big ones, and itxe2x80x99s absolutely fascinating. Tencent's PortfolioWhen you add the current value of just those 103 investments to the operating business value based on standalone business comps from the previous section, you land at a 15% higher valuation than Tencent is trading at today. The math is rough and not meant to be investment advice, but itxe2x80x99s helpful in thinking through how to build a complete picture of Tencent.In Tencentxe2x80x99s Q2 earnings report, it mentions that the fair value of its investments in listed (public) investee companies, excluding subsidiaries (companies of which Tencent owns more than 50%), is $102.6 billion as of June 30, 2020. If you add that number to the $538 billion operating businesses value from the last section, you get $640 billion, almost exactly in line with Tencentxe2x80x99s current market cap of $628 billion. So far, so good.But that $102.6 billion is just part of the portfolio - the publicly listed non-subsidiaries. When you include investments in private companies, based on most recently announced valuations and some rough estimates, I get a current portfolio value nearly twice as big, at $187 billion. And thatxe2x80x99s without 600 of the (likely smaller) investments that Tencent claims to have made. Tencent is a really hard business to value accurately for a few reasons: Just in its operating business, it does a lot of different things.In addition to the operating business, itxe2x80x99s also a venture fund, a late stage fund, a private equity fund, and a hedge fund. Startup outcomes are so unpredictable, even with Tencentxe2x80x99s muscle behind them. But I have a sneaking suspicion that its venture investments are worth somewhere north of zero, so letxe2x80x99s take a closer look at its entire portfolio. Where does Tencent invest?Tencentxe2x80x99s investments are split fairly evenly between China and International. Of the 103 Tencent investments Ixe2x80x99m tracking, 54 are in China and 49 are international. Including acquired subsidiaries, the current value of investments by country break down like this: Tencent uses the cash it generates largely in China to diversify away from China, which is particularly important given that, even with its largest companies, the Chinese government can be hard to predict. In 2018, for example, a government game review process slowed the growth of Tencentxe2x80x99s gaming business in the country and tanked its stock over 20%. Just this morning, it announced an investment in French gaming company Voodoo, and gaming analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out that Voodooxe2x80x99s ad-based games would get around Chinese regulations requiring reviews of any games that monetize through in-game purchases.What does Tencent own?Tencentxe2x80x99s largest holdings include investments in some of the largest and fastest-growing gaming, music, and technology companies.Tencentxe2x80x99s top 10 holdings span: Familiar names like Tesla and Snap, Chinese ecommerce giants Meituan Dianping, JD.com, and Pinduoduo (Turner Novak on Pinduoduo)Chinaxe2x80x99s largest digital bank, WeBank, TikTok competitor Kuaishou, Beike, a Chinese Zillow which just went public last week in the largest US IPO of a Chinese company since early 2018,Sea Ltd, the Singaporean gaming, ecommerce, and payments company that looks like the Tencent of SE Asia (Julie Young on Sea)Epic Games, the US gaming company, Fortnite creator, and owner of the Unreal Engine (Matthew Ball on Epic Games)By my count, Tencent has 83 companies worth more than $1 billion dollars in its portfolio. 52 are unicorns, private companies worth $1 billion, which places it in the number two spot right behind #1 Sequoia Capital, which has invested in 109 according to the Hurun Global Unicorn Index, and ahead of third place SoftBank, which has 51. (In a January speech, Lau said that that company has 160 companies in its portfolio worth more than $1 billion, which would put it #1.)At home, Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest investments are in ecommerce, and it plans to double-down on xe2x80x9csmart retailxe2x80x9d given the success of its WeChat Mini Programs. Abroad, almost half of the value of the portfolio is in gaming companies. In both its Chinese and international strategies, Tencent has unfair advantages, and those advantages shape what types of businesses the company invests in. How do they do it? ChinaBusinesses in China run on WeChat. They can communicate with customers on Official Accounts, get distribution through group chats, build entire functioning products with Mini Programs, and accept payments through WeChat Pay. WeChat is Tencentxe2x80x99s unfair advantage in China. Itxe2x80x99s the top of Tencentxe2x80x99s acquisition funnel. Three of Tencentxe2x80x99s four largest holdings - Meituan Dianping, JD.com, and Pinduoduo - are Chinese ecommerce businesses that run on top of WeChat. Tencent uses data from WeChat to source investments, and then provides preferential placement to its investeesxe2x80x99 Official Accounts and Mini Programs within WeChat. For example, when Tencent invested in JD in 2014 to take on Alibabaxe2x80x99s Tmall, Reuters wrote: The deal gives JD.com a headline slot on Tencentxe2x80x99s WeChat app that dominates Chinaxe2x80x99s smartphones, an entry into eBay-style consumer-to-consumer shopping and a backer with the muscle to help it make the most of a logistics infrastructure that Alibaba lacks.Today, Tencentxe2x80x99s investments in JD.com, Meituan Dianping, and Pinduoduo are worth $68.5 billion.No one else has the transaction data or the ability to boost a companyxe2x80x99s distribution the way that Tencent does with WeChat. This will continue to be an advantage - in just three years, there are over 1 million WeChat Mini Programs. Tencent can cherry pick the best, invest, and practically guarantee their success.  International Whereas Tencentxe2x80x99s China portfolio is top-heavy with ecommerce unicorns, its international portfolio includes everything from an 86-year-old American music label, Universal Music Group, to 7-year-old Brazilian neobank, Nubank. Itsxe2x80x99 biggest investment category, though, is games. It owns stakes in the companies behind popular titles including League of Legends (Riot Games 100%), Fortnite (Epic Games, 40%), Clash of Clans (Supercell, 81.4%), PUBG (Bluehole, 10%), Path of Exile (Grinding Gear Games, 80%), Call of Duty, Overwatch, Starcraft, and Candy Crush (Activision Blizzard, 5%). It even owns 1.3% of Roblox, which lets kids build their own games, and 2% of Discord, a chat platform used mainly by gamers. Tencent invests in international game companies and distributes their titles to the Chinese market. This is Tencentxe2x80x99s unfair advantage: companies essentially need to partner with Tencent or Alibaba to operate in China. This is true beyond games, too. The Canadian version of Dunkin Donuts, Tim Hortons, wants to expand into China, so it recently took on an investment from Tencent. Tencent invested in Universal and Warner Music Group in part to control the licensing of their catalogs in China. In addition to strategic investments in games and music, Tencent makes venture-style investments in fast-growing companies that have the potential to win large markets. It has shown a particular affinity for non-gaming investments in India, the only other country with as large a population as Chinaxe2x80x99s. It has invested in ecommerce standout Flipkart, transportation unicorn Ola, education startup Byju, food delivery app Swiggy, and fintech darling Khatabook, among others. In the US, Singapore, and Indonesia, it has invested in the companies building super apps most similar to its own core product, WeChat -- Snap, Sea, and Gojek. Tencentxe2x80x99s international portfolio is large, diverse, and complex, with bets at all stages, in all categories, and for all sorts of reasons. As a result, I think that investors undervalue it. But while the world catches up, Tencent keeps zooming further into the future. The real magic in the portfolio is just beginning to bloom. Itxe2x80x99s that future that has me most excited about the company. Wexe2x80x99ve gone on quite a journey today, covering Tencentxe2x80x99s history and what itxe2x80x99s up to today, including its core operating businesses and how it invests the massive profits that those businesses generate to participate in the internetxe2x80x99s growth at home and around the world.In Part II on Thursday, wexe2x80x99ll get our crystal balls out and talk about what Tencentxe2x80x99s investments tell us about the future, and how the company has positioned itself to sit at the center of the next world: the Metaverse. That means we get to explore some hairier subjects, like the influence of the Chinese Communist Party, Epicxe2x80x99s fight with Apple, the threats to its current business and long-term mission, and much, much more. Thanks Dan and Puja for editing, Sid for input, Turner for investment accounting help, and  Julia Wu, Matthew Brennan, Ben Gilbert, and David Rosenthal for excellent background info.Wexe2x80x99ll be back right here for Part II, Tencentxe2x80x99s Future, on Thursday.

You should leave this two-part essay with a better understanding of what Tencent does, what it owns, and why itxe2x80x99s one of the most significant companies in the world.The Chinese pager-based internet service that Pony Ma launched in 1998 is now the worldxe2x80x99s seventh most valuable company, right ahead of Berkshire Hathaway and right behind its bitter rival, Alibaba. As of Friday, Tencent is worth $628 billion.In China, Tencent is like Facebook, Nintendo, Shopify, Netflix, Spotify, Slack, and PayPal rolled into one. Its flagship product, WeChat, has 1.2 billion users, and those users spend more time in the app every day than Americans spend on all social media apps combined. People use WeChat to message friends, shop, read the news, play games, pay for things in physical storesxe2x80xa6 pretty anything you can do on your phone, you can do on WeChat. Tencent turned the profits from its social networking, ecommerce, and gaming cash cows into a global investment portfolio that includes many of the worldxe2x80x99s most popular video games, the fastest-growing internet businesses in China, meaningful stakes in Tesla, Spotify, and Snap, and a portfolio of international startup unicorns second only to Sequoiaxe2x80x99s. It even financed A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Americans donxe2x80x99t know much about Tencent because, in addition to being Chinese, itxe2x80x99s really fucking complex. Itxe2x80x99s both one of the most profitable operating businesses in the world and one of the most ambitious investment funds. Tencent has been dubbed xe2x80x9cThe SoftBank of Chinaxe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cThe Berkshire Hathaway of Tech.xe2x80x9d Neither description does it justice. While it gets less hype, its performance puts SoftBankxe2x80x99s to shame. Itxe2x80x99s going to be one of the most important companies in the world for decades to come. Today, in Part I, Ixe2x80x99m going to explain Tencent in four sections: What is Tencent? An entrepreneurial story just like the ones you hear in the US, with all of the highs, lows, and near-deaths. An improbable journey from pager-based internet service to the giant holding company it is today.The Outsiders. William N. Thorndikexe2x80x99s 2012 book, The Outsiders, about eight of the most successful CEOs in US history, provides a framework for thinking about Tencentxe2x80x99s business. CEO Pony Ma shares all of the important characteristics with the eight that Thorndike wrote about.Tencentxe2x80x99s Operating Businesses. Tencentxe2x80x99s core business makes money in six main ways, and each of its business units rivals in, both scope and revenue, massive, standalone public companies.Tencentxe2x80x99s Investment Portfolio. Therexe2x80x99s no great public source for all of Tencentxe2x80x99s 700-800 investments, so I created a database of 103 of its biggest and share insights around where it invests, in which types of companies, and the unfair advantages it has as an investor.  The founding stories of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon are canon for the type of people who read Not Boring. Theyxe2x80x99re part of modern American mythology. Itxe2x80x99s time for us to get to know Tencent.Note: Ixe2x80x99ve used Julia Wuxe2x80x99s summary of Wu Xiaoboxe2x80x99s book, Matthew Brennanxe2x80x99s presentations, and the excellent Acquired podcast on Tencent to piece together Tencentxe2x80x99s history. Wexe2x80x99ve been conditioned to think of massive Chinese technology companies as shady, government-controlled businesses out to steal your data and try to take over the world. It might surprise you, then, that Tencent started out like a lot of US startups: as an entrepreneurial itch that one 26-year-old nerd had to scratch with the help of some friends. Ma Huateng was born at the right time and moved to the right place. Ma was born in the Hainan province in 1971 and moved to Shenzhen when he was 13. In the late 1970s, Chinese President Deng Xiaoping designated Shenzhen as a special economic zone as part of his xe2x80x9creform and opening policy.xe2x80x9d Ma, whose family name meant xe2x80x9chorsexe2x80x9d and whose nickname, appropriately, was Pony, grew up in the one capitalist place in communist China. Ma was prodigiously smart. He scored high enough in college entrance exams to go anywhere in the country, but stayed close to home, attending Shenzhen University. The school didnxe2x80x99t have the astronomy major that Ma was most interested in, so he settled for his second choice: computer science. He was a natural. Ma regularly won student hacking contests, and built graphical user interfaces before they were a thing in China. While interning at one of Chinaxe2x80x99s leading tech companies, Ma built a stock market analysis tool with a GUI as a side project, and sold it to his employer for 50,000 Chinese Yuan (CNY), or about 3 yearsxe2x80x99 salary. If this were a novel, the fact that Pony Maxe2x80x99s first product combined tech and finance and his first taste of wealth came from an M&A transaction would be called foreshadowing. After college, Ma spent five years at a pager company, where he was exposed to the latest technology (pagers!) and became a manager. But Ma was living a second life in the early online chatrooms. He joined the growing FidoNet community, participating in and then hosting early internet bulletin board systems, where he met future billionaires like Xiaomixe2x80x99s Lei Jun and NetEasexe2x80x99s Ding Lei. Inspired by Leixe2x80x99s early success with NetEase (which today is worth $65 billion), in 1998, Ma left his job and convinced his friend, Zhang Zhidong, to start a company with him. They planned to combine the internet and pagers, which were popular in China at the time, to build a mobile internet on which people could send email, news, and more. Sticking with Maxe2x80x99s equestrian nomenclature, they named the company Tengxun, which means xe2x80x9cgalloping message.xe2x80x9d Tencent is the anglicized version of Tengxun. As Tencent was building its pager-based internet, Ma noticed the Israeli internet communication tool and Instant Messenger competitor ICQ, which sold to AOL in 1998, and decided to build a version for the Chinese market. Creatively, he called it OICQ, and built distribution and features necessary to serve customers who didnxe2x80x99t own personal computers, but increasingly accessed them in internet cafes. OICQ took off, and Tencent abandoned the pager internet. Users quadrupled every three months. After nine months, OICQ hit one million users. But this was pre-AWS (or Tencent Cloud) and servers were expensive. Plus, AOL sued Tencnent to change OICQxe2x80x99s name. They were running out of money, so Ma launched a dual-track process to either sell the company or raise money. Tencent was aiming for 3 million yuan in a sale ($431k at todayxe2x80x99s exchange rate), but the highest offer it received was for 600k yuan ($86,327). The lack of demand turned out to be a pretty lucky break. Today, itxe2x80x99s worth 1,454,929x its 3 million yuan asking price. With no acquirer, Ma sold 40% of Tencent to early US-based Chinese venture investor IDG Capital and Yingke, a fund led by Chinese billionaire Li Kashingxe2x80x99s son, for $2.2 million. But it wasnxe2x80x99t out of the woods.Soon after, AOL won its lawsuit, forcing Tencent to change the name of its flagship product. It chose QQ. Server costs continued to increase as the company crossed 100 million users with no revenue model. Tencent was back on the market. It approached Chinese search company Sohu and Yahoo! China. Neither was interested. Then, in 2001, the South African firm Naspers (literally) walked in the door and offered to invest at a $60 million valuation. So that Ma didnxe2x80x99t lose majority ownership, IDG sold 12.8% of its 20% and Yingke sold its entire stake for an 11x gain (not bad!), giving Naspers 32.8% of the company for $19.68 million. Today, that investment is worth $205 billion, good for a 10,436x return!With Naspersxe2x80x99 money in the bank, the Tencent team turned its attention to monetization. In 2002, a product manager discovered the Korean company sayclub.com, which monetized by allowing users to create personalized avatars. Tencent built its own version, QQ Show, and within 6 months, the product had 5 million users paying 5 yuan (a little less than $1) per month. As Julia Wu points out, the ability to personalize an avatar was such a hit because under communism, Chinese people had been xe2x80x9cdull and collectivexe2x80x9d in their personal representation. Tencent also launched a xe2x80x9cred diamond membershipxe2x80x9d for 10 yuan per month, for VIP status, monthly virtual gifts, and discounts in the QQ marketplace. This is a really important piece to understand. In the US, as we talked about in If I Ruled the Tweets, social media monetizes through advertising. In Asia, it mainly monetizes through digital gifts, subscriptions, and purchases. To this day, xe2x80x9cValue Added Servicesxe2x80x9d generate more than 3x the revenue for Tencent than xe2x80x9cOnline Advertising.xe2x80x9d Avatars were big business. In 2003, Tencent hit a $100 million run rate and moved beyond messaging by building a portal, like a Chinese AOL. The team also realized that a lot of its users were chatting on QQ while playing games in internet cafes, so it added games to the QQ platform, both by acquiring small studios and building games in-house. Within a year, games added another $50 million in annual revenue. With monetization booming, Tencent IPOxe2x80x99d in 2004  at a valuation of 6.22 billion HKD, or $790 million USD. Cue Motley Fool headline: if you had invested $10,000 in Tencent at its IPO in 2004, you would have $7.9 million today. Oh, you didnxe2x80x99t invest in Tecent at its IPO? Damn. To be fair, itxe2x80x99s a very different company today than it was then, thanks to two 2005 hires: Martin Lau and Allen Zhang.After completing its IPO, Tencent hired the Goldman Sachs investment banker who took it public, Martin Lau. Lau had the pedigree - Chinese-born, undergrad at Michigan, engineering masters at Stanford, and MBA at Kellogg - and a skillset that was complementary to Maxe2x80x99s. Lau became the English-speaking face of the business, taking on a role that the shy Ma hated, and the master capital allocator. In the beginning of his tenure, Lau focused on acquiring studios to grow its scorching games business as the Chief Strategy Officer. By the next year, Ma promoted him to President. Tencent also turned its attention to competitive threats to the portal business, including Microsoftxe2x80x99s increasing presence in China via MSN. To combat the threat, it acquired competitor Foxmail in 2005 to build QQ Mail. The product was successful, but more importantly, Tencent acquired the developer behind Foxmail, Allen Zhang. With Lau and Zhang on board, Tencent grew rapidly via desktop games and the QQ platform. Its revenue jumped 15x from $200 million in 2005 to $2.9 billion in 2010. But 2011 was the year when Zhang and Lau really made their mark. In 2010, early in the rise of mobile, Zhang noticed the popularity of Canadian messaging company called Kik, and convinced Ma to let him build a Chinese version for Tencent. The next seven years changed the trajectory of the company.2011: Working around the clock with a small team, Zhang launched Weixin in January. English speakers know it as WeChat. (Theyxe2x80x99re actually two separate products - Weixin serves Mainland China and WeChat serves the rest of the world, but wexe2x80x99ll refer to the two interchangeably as WeChat.) After early competition with Xiaomixe2x80x99s Mi Chat, WeChat pulled away by tapping into QQxe2x80x99s existing user base, and then launching xe2x80x9cFriends Nearby,xe2x80x9d which was like an early version of Tinder. WeChat began adding 100k users per day.2012: WeChat hit 100 million users. It took 433 days to hit that mark. By comparison, it took QQ ten years, Facebook 5.5 years, and Twitter 4 years. In April, WeChat launched the Moments newsfeed and Official Accounts, allowing publishers to distribute content and businesses to distribute products and services. By the end of the year, it had 300 million users. 2013: Tencent launched WeChat Pay to enable payment through the platform. 2015: WeChat crossed half a billion users. 2017: WeChat launched Mini Programs, allowing businesses to build full-functionality apps within the WeChat platform. Companies like Pinduoduo build on top of WeChat and tap into all of its customersxe2x80x99 existing social and professional networks. Mini Programs turn WeChat into a xe2x80x9csuper app,xe2x80x9d and are the inspiration behind Snap Minis, which we covered in Oh Snap!. WeChat, for all intents and purposes, is the mobile operating system in China.Back to Lau. While Zhang was building WeChat, Lau was busy acquiring games, laying the foundation for the next stage of growth. Two investments in 2011 and 2012 were particularly important. In 2011, Tencent acquired 92.8% of US game studio, Riot Games, creators of League of Legends for $400 million (they acquired the remaining 7.2% in 2015). The next year, in 2012, it acquired 40% of Cary, NC-based game company, Epic Games for $330 million.Today, Epic and Riot are two of the gems in Tencentxe2x80x99s gaming portfolio. League of Legends is a cornerstone of a gaming division that brought in $5.5 billion in Q2 alone. As we will explore in xe2x80x9cTencentxe2x80x99s Future,xe2x80x9d Epic may also be the engine (pun intended) that drives the next massive phase of Tencentxe2x80x99s growth and puts it at the center of a new, virtual world. Over the past decade, Lau and his team have acquired or invested in over 700 companies, funded by the massive pools of cash Tencentxe2x80x99s gaming division and WeChat spit off.WeChat has over 1.2 billions users today. And those users are incredibly engaged. WeChat users in China spend an average of four hours per day in the app, more time than US users spend on all social media apps combined. Chinese users do everything on WeChat. They communicate with friends, co-workers, and clients through WeChat. Businesses communicate with customers through Official Accounts. They can also sell things through those accounts. Thousands of businesses, including ridesharing (Didi) and food delivery (Meituan Dianping), launched on WeChat. Tencent monetizes WeChat mainly through transactions instead of ads.So putting it all together, what is Tencent? Tencent is a Chinese holding company that is the world leader in gaming and runs the largest messaging, social networking, and mobile payments platform in China. It uses the cash flow from those businesses to invest in the next generation of massive companies in China and around the globe. Tencent combines the diversification of an old school conglomerate with the growth and decentralization of an internet-native business into a company that may become the largest in the world.From its roots as a product company, Tencent has become the best capital allocator of any non-investment company in the world. Itxe2x80x99s running The Outsiders playbook to perfection.In 2012, William N. Thorndike unintentionally wrote the guide to understanding Tencentxe2x80x99s dominance: The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.In it, Thorndike explores the things that eight CEOs -- including Warren Buffett, The Washington Postxe2x80x99s Katharine Graham, Teledynexe2x80x99s Henry Singleton, and Capital Citiesxe2x80x99 Tom Murphy -- did differently that made them more successful than their peers.How does he measure success? You really only need to know three things to evaluate a CEOxe2x80x99s greatness: the compound annual return to shareholders during his or her tenure and the return over the same period for peer companies and for the broader market (usually measured by the S&P 500).By that measure, Pony Ma has been one of the worldxe2x80x99s most successful CEOs. Since Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest competitor, Alibaba, went public in September 2014, Tencent has returned 305% versus:182% for Alibaba-48% for Baidu 68%, 141%, and 10% for the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Hang Sen Index, respectively.Over the past six years, Tencent has outperformed the index that tracks the largest companies in Hong Kongxe2x80x99s stock market by 30x.Why has Tencent outperformed? For the same reasons that Thorndike highlighted in The Outsiders eight years ago. Pony Ma and Tencent share the characteristics common among the most successful CEOs, and take some to extremes. Outsider CEOs were private, ran decentralized organizations, and masterfully allocated capital to the opportunities, internal or external, with the highest potential to drive their stockxe2x80x99s performance. Pony Ma is the ultimate Outsider! As a result, hexe2x80x99s now Chinaxe2x80x99s richest man with a net worth of $56.2 billion. And the business that he built is a master class in capital allocation, as wexe2x80x99ll see by breaking Tencent down into its two main businesses, which often interact with each other: Operating Businesses and Investments.Tencentxe2x80x99s core business makes money in six main ways: PaymentsSubscriptions (like video and music)Social adsMedia ads GamesCloudHerexe2x80x99s a breakdown of how revenue maps to business lines from a 2017 presentation by China tech analyst, Matthew Brennan:  All clear? Ok good, moving on. JK, itxe2x80x99s super complex. Letxe2x80x99s break it down by looking at Tencentxe2x80x99s Q2 results, converted to USD:Social Networks. Instead of ads, Social Networks includes Value Added Services revenue like subscriptions for video and music and in-game purchases. It has 114 million paid video subscriptions and 47 million paid music subscriptions. Online Games. Games are Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest business. Tencent has 17 separate franchises that have exceeded 10 million daily active users, not including Epic Gamesxe2x80x99 Fortnite, in which it has a large, non-controlling stake.Online Advertising - Media. It includes ads on Tecent Videoxe2x80x99s properties, as well as in Tencentxe2x80x99s various other digital, news, and video media properties. Online Advertising - Social and Others. This segment looks the most similar to US social media companiesxe2x80x99 monetization. One of the biggest drivers is companies paying for ads in WeChat Moments, and analysts highlight the fact that WeChat still has a relatively light ad load and room to grow.FinTech and Business Services. Tencentxe2x80x99s second largest segment, it includes all of TenPay, the largest online payments platform in China encompassing WeChat Pay and QQ Pay, as well as WeChatxe2x80x99s wealth management business. When consumers and businesses buy from businesses on WeChat, via Official Accounts and Mini Programs, the fee Tencent takes is captured here, as does the fee Tencent takes when people use WeChat Pay to pay offline and across the web. FinTech and Business Services also includes its cloud business. Although it didnxe2x80x99t break cloud revenue out separately in Q2, it was a $2.4 billion business in 2019.To give you a sense for Tencentxe2x80x99s scope and scale, herexe2x80x99s how Tencentxe2x80x99s business lines compare to entire industry-leading companies based on Q2 revenue. Tencentxe2x80x99s Payments business is nearly as big as PayPalxe2x80x99s entire business, and it generated five times as much revenue as Shopify in Q2. Its subscription revenue alone is 62% of Netflixxe2x80x99s. It has some catching up to do in Social Ads, where it generates only 12% as much as the leader, Facebook, although it did generate more than 3x as much social ads revenue as Twitter. Its small media ads business is bigger than the New York Times. Games revenue is 64% higher than the worldxe2x80x99s most valuable standalone gaming company, Nintendo. Breaking cloud out of Payments and Business Services, based on last year ($600 million per quarter), itxe2x80x99s far behind AWS in cloud, with only 6% of the revenue.Itxe2x80x99s difficult to wrap your arms around Tencent, and as a result, the company likely trades at a discount to its more focused American counterparts. If you applied the same Q2 revenue multiples at which each of the businesses in the chart above is currently trading to the corresponding Tencent business segment, its operating businesses alone would be valued at $538 billion, 86% of the companyxe2x80x99s current market cap.And thatxe2x80x99s before you get to the part of Tencentxe2x80x99s business that excites me the most, its expansive portfolio of investments.Did you know that Tencent owns 5% of Tesla, 12% of Snap, and 9% of Spotify (including a stake through Tencent Music)? Those stakes are worth $15.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.2 billion, respectively, and they barely scratch the surface. In The Outsiders, Thorndike wrote, xe2x80x9cCEOs need to do two things well: run their operations efficiently, and deploy the cash generated by those operations.xe2x80x9d In Q2, Tencent generated $5.4 billion in operating profit. Job 1: xe2x9cx85  Itxe2x80x99s how Tencent deploys the cash generated by those operations thatxe2x80x99s so fascinating, though. Two of Pony Maxe2x80x99s top lieutenants, President Martin Lau and Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell, are ex-Goldman bankers. As one VC told the Financial Times: xe2x80x9cWhen you put a basketball player in the room, you know what theyxe2x80x99re going to do. If you hire Goldman Sachs bankers, you know what they are going to do.xe2x80x9dThe analogy is a bit of a stretch, but the answer is clear: theyxe2x80x99re going to do M&A. On its most recent earnings call, Martin Lau said:Our M&A strategy has always been trying to invest in up and coming companies which have a great management, who have innovative products, and at the same time, they have synergies with our existing platforms. We now have more than 700 companies.More than 700 companies!Therexe2x80x99s nowhere online to find all of Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest investments, their ownership stake, and the current value of the investments in one placexe2x80xa6 so I built it. I have only 103 of the 700 investments in there, but I think I have all the big ones, and itxe2x80x99s absolutely fascinating. Tencent's PortfolioWhen you add the current value of just those 103 investments to the operating business value based on standalone business comps from the previous section, you land at a 15% higher valuation than Tencent is trading at today. The math is rough and not meant to be investment advice, but itxe2x80x99s helpful in thinking through how to build a complete picture of Tencent.In Tencentxe2x80x99s Q2 earnings report, it mentions that the fair value of its investments in listed (public) investee companies, excluding subsidiaries (companies of which Tencent owns more than 50%), is $102.6 billion as of June 30, 2020. If you add that number to the $538 billion operating businesses value from the last section, you get $640 billion, almost exactly in line with Tencentxe2x80x99s current market cap of $628 billion. So far, so good.But that $102.6 billion is just part of the portfolio - the publicly listed non-subsidiaries. When you include investments in private companies, based on most recently announced valuations and some rough estimates, I get a current portfolio value nearly twice as big, at $187 billion. And thatxe2x80x99s without 600 of the (likely smaller) investments that Tencent claims to have made. Tencent is a really hard business to value accurately for a few reasons: Just in its operating business, it does a lot of different things.In addition to the operating business, itxe2x80x99s also a venture fund, a late stage fund, a private equity fund, and a hedge fund. Startup outcomes are so unpredictable, even with Tencentxe2x80x99s muscle behind them. But I have a sneaking suspicion that its venture investments are worth somewhere north of zero, so letxe2x80x99s take a closer look at its entire portfolio. Where does Tencent invest?Tencentxe2x80x99s investments are split fairly evenly between China and International. Of the 103 Tencent investments Ixe2x80x99m tracking, 54 are in China and 49 are international. Including acquired subsidiaries, the current value of investments by country break down like this: Tencent uses the cash it generates largely in China to diversify away from China, which is particularly important given that, even with its largest companies, the Chinese government can be hard to predict. In 2018, for example, a government game review process slowed the growth of Tencentxe2x80x99s gaming business in the country and tanked its stock over 20%. Just this morning, it announced an investment in French gaming company Voodoo, and gaming analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out that Voodooxe2x80x99s ad-based games would get around Chinese regulations requiring reviews of any games that monetize through in-game purchases.What does Tencent own?Tecentxe2x80x99s largest holdings include investments in some of the largest and fastest-growing gaming, music, and technology companies.Tencentxe2x80x99s top 10 holdings span: Familiar names like Tesla and Snap, Chinese ecommerce giants Meituan Dianping, JD.com, and Pinduoduo (Turner Novak on Pinduoduo)Chinaxe2x80x99s largest digital bank, WeBank, TikTok competitor Kuaishou, Beike, a Chinese Zillow which just went public last week in the largest US IPO of a Chinese company since early 2018,Sea Ltd, the Singaporean gaming, ecommerce, and payments company that looks like the Tencent of SE Asia (Julie Young on Sea)Epic Games, the US gaming company, Fortnite creator, and owner of the Unreal Engine (Matthew Ball on Epic Games)By my count, Tencent has 83 companies worth more than $1 billion dollars in its portfolio. 52 are unicorns, private companies worth $1 billion, which places it in the number two spot right behind #1 Sequoia Capital, which has invested in 109 according to the Hurun Global Unicorn Index, and ahead of third place SoftBank, which has 51. (In a January speech, Lau said that that company has 160 companies in its portfolio worth more than $1 billion, which would put it #1.)At home, Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest investments are in ecommerce, and it plans to double-down on xe2x80x9csmart retailxe2x80x9d given the success of its WeChat Mini Programs. Abroad, almost half of the value of the portfolio is in gaming companies. In both its Chinese and international strategies, Tencent has unfair advantages, and those advantages shape what types of businesses the company invests in. How do they do it? ChinaBusinesses in China run on WeChat. They can communicate with customers on Official Accounts, get distribution through group chats, build entire functioning products with Mini Programs, and accept payments through WeChat Pay. WeChat is Tencentxe2x80x99s unfair advantage in China. Itxe2x80x99s the top of Tencentxe2x80x99s acquisition funnel. Three of Tencentxe2x80x99s four largest holdings - Meituan Dianping, JD.com, and Pinduoduo - are Chinese ecommerce businesses that run on top of WeChat. Tencent uses data from WeChat to source investments, and then provides preferential placement to its investeesxe2x80x99 Official Accounts and Mini Programs within WeChat. For example, when Tencent invested in JD in 2014 to take on Alibabaxe2x80x99s Tmall, Reuters wrote: The deal gives JD.com a headline slot on Tencentxe2x80x99s WeChat app that dominates Chinaxe2x80x99s smartphones, an entry into eBay-style consumer-to-consumer shopping and a backer with the muscle to help it make the most of a logistics infrastructure that Alibaba lacks.Today, Tencentxe2x80x99s investments in JD.com, Meituan Dianping, and Pinduoduo are worth $68.5 billion.No one else has the transaction data or the ability to boost a companyxe2x80x99s distribution the way that Tencent does with WeChat. This will continue to be an advantage - in just three years, there are over 1 million WeChat Mini Programs. Tencent can cherry pick the best, invest, and practically guarantee their success.  International Whereas Tencentxe2x80x99s China portfolio is top-heavy with ecommerce unicorns, its international portfolio includes everything from an 86-year-old American music label, Universal Music Group, to 7-year-old Brazilian neobank, Nubank. Itsxe2x80x99 biggest investment category, though, is games. It owns stakes in the companies behind popular titles including League of Legends (Riot Games 100%), Fortnite (Epic Games, 40%), Clash of Clans (Supercell, 81.4%), PUBG (Bluehole, 10%), Path of Exile (Grinding Gear Games, 80%), Call of Duty, Overwatch, Starcraft, and Candy Crush (Activision Blizzard, 5%). It even owns 1.3% of Roblox, which lets kids build their own games, and 2% of Discord, a chat platform used mainly by gamers. Tencent invests in international game companies and distributes their titles to the Chinese market. This is Tencentxe2x80x99s unfair advantage: companies essentially need to partner with Tencent or Alibaba to operate in China. This is true beyond games, too. The Canadian version of Dunkin Donuts, Tim Hortons, wants to expand into China, so it recently took on an investment from Tencent. Tencent invested in Universal and Warner Music Group in part to control the licensing of their catalogs in China. In addition to strategic investments in games and music, Tencent makes venture-style investments in fast-growing companies that have the potential to win large markets. It has shown a particular affinity for non-gaming investments in India, the only other country with as large a population as Chinaxe2x80x99s. It has invested in ecommerce standout Flipkart, transportation unicorn Ola, education startup Bydu, food delivery app Swiggy, and fintech darling Khatabook, among others. In the US, Singapore, and Indonesia, it has invested in the companies building super apps most similar to its own core product, WeChat -- Snap, Sea, and Gojek. Tencentxe2x80x99s international portfolio is large, diverse, and complex, with bets at all stages, in all categories, and for all sorts of reasons. As a result, I think that investors undervalue it. But while the world catches up, Tencent keeps zooming further into the future. The real magic in the portfolio is just beginning to bloom. Itxe2x80x99s that future that has me most excited about the company. Tencentxe2x80x99s FutureWexe2x80x99ve gone on quite a journey today, covering Tencentxe2x80x99s history and what itxe2x80x99s up to today, including its core operating businesses and how it invests the massive profits that those businesses generate to participate in the internetxe2x80x99s growth at home and around the world.In Part II on Thursday, wexe2x80x99ll get our crystal balls out and talk about what Tencentxe2x80x99s investments tell us about the future, and how the company has positioned itself to sit at the center of the next world: the Metaverse. That means we get to explore some hairier subjects, like the influence of the Chinese Communist Party, Epicxe2x80x99s fight with Apple, the threats to its current business and long-term mission, and much, much more. Thanks Dan and Puja for editing, Sid for input, Turner for investment accounting help, and  Julia Wu, Matthew Brennan, Ben Gilbert, and David Rosenthal for excellent background info.Thanks for listening, PackyFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.pretty goodGreat informative article..

I hope you get to spend the 4th on the beach, with friends and family, plowing through all of the links below. Debate ClubNerd alert: I was on the debate team in high school and for a couple of years in college. I loved researching a topic, preparing arguments, and getting up in front of a group of people and battling with only words as weapons. In any given debate, you never knew if you were going to be supporting or opposing the resolution, so you needed to be able to build a case for both sides, regardless of your personal opinion. For the past few years, I have been talking to some friends about starting a casual Debate Club in NYC. Writing this newsletter and getting to discuss and *debate* the things I write and the articles I share with a bunch of you has pushed me to stop talking about it and try to actually start the Debate Club now. I want to gauge interest, so I wrote a short post on why I want to start the club and what the format might look like: New York City Debate Club.If you would be interested, fill out this form to be added to the waitlist: Debate Club Form. If you know anyone else who you think would enjoy debating, feel free to share! What Ixe2x80x99m Readingxf0x9fx8fxa8 After two straight non-fiction reads in Loonshots and Range (both highly-recommended), Ixe2x80x99m treating myself to some fiction in the form of A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles. It tells the story of Count Alexander Rostov, who in 1922 is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol Hotel in Moscow by the Bolsheviks for a poem that he wrote. Reading about Russia in the 1920xe2x80x99s under the Bolsheviks via one fictional manxe2x80x99s journey is more tangible to me than reading about the period in a history book, but what really gets me is the writing, like this passage:xe2x80x9cAs he began to shuffle the pack, the three ballerinas watched him closely; but like demi-gods of ancient myth, they watched in three different ways: the first through the eyes of the innocent, the second through the eyes of the romantic, and the third through the eyes of the skeptic. It was the dove with the innocent eyes whom the Count had asked to pick a card.xe2x80x9dI have accidentally gone on a Russia kick recently (more below). The last novel I read was Catherynne M. Valentexe2x80x99s Deathless, xe2x80x9ca collision of magical history and actual history, of revolution and mythology, of love and death, which will bring Russian myth back to life in a stunning new incarnation.xe2x80x9d Magical realism is my favorite genre, and Deathless was my first encounter with its Russian incarnation. It was an incredibly enjoyable read, and it may have subconsciously been the spark that lit my recent Russia spree. Links & Listensxf0x9fx8exac The Last Black Man in San Francisco (Movie)A Per My Last E-mail first: movie recommendation! On its surface, The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a story about the impact of gentrification on one man whose family has lived in San Francisco for three generations. Itxe2x80x99s also a story about friendship, loss, and the stories we tell ourselves to keep going. It was magically shot; certain scenes made me feel the way Wes Anderson movies make me feel, without the underlying sarcasm. There were at least 10 times throughout the movie that Puja and I looked at each other with goofy grins on our faces because the shots, characters, or dialogue were so much different than what wexe2x80x99ve come to expect. I give The Last Black Man in San Francisco an enthusiastic  xf0x9fx91x8dxf0x9fx8fxbbxf0x9fx91x8dxf0x9fx8fxbb. Go see it. xf0x9fx87xb7xf0x9fx87xba The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History in Wired & The Hero Who Betrayed His Country in The AtlanticBetween A Gentleman in Moscow and these two articles, I can safely say: Russia is crazy. (If youxe2x80x99re reading this, sorry, I mean it in a good way, xd1x8f xd0xbexd0xb1xd0xb5xd1x89xd0xb0xd1x8e.) The Untold Story of NotPetya is a fascinating exploration of a 2017 cyberattack that shut down the worldxe2x80x99s largest shipping company, Maersk, along with many others, causing an estimated $10 billion in damages. Some saw the damage as an accidental casualty of a Russian attack targeted only at Ukraine, but Ciscoxe2x80x99s Craig Williams argued, xe2x80x9cAnyone who thinks this was accidental is engaged in wishful thinking. This was a piece of malware designed to send a political message: If you do business in Ukraine, bad things are going to happen to you.xe2x80x9dThe Hero Who Betrayed His Country tells the story of an Estonian soldier who was honeytrapped into becoming a Russian spy. It is a fascinating look at how someone who has dedicated his life to defending his country can be coerced to spy against it, with details on the complex machine the Russians have built to turn assets. For even more Russia reading, I canxe2x80x99t recommend Red Notice by Bill Browder highly enough. Browder was an American hedge fund manager based in Russia, and the events he writes about in the book ultimately led to the creation of the Magnitsky Act, which has shown up in the news on multiple occasions over the past couple of years.xf0x9fx8fx80 4,000-to-1 Long Shot by Ryan KreugerWith the Warriors dynasty officially imploding (unless Dxe2x80x99Lo is the new KD), this post comparing successful financial planning to Steph Curryxe2x80x99s game in 7 steps is a timely read. If you can pardon a few typos and grammatical errors, and the fact that the titular 4,000-to-1 math is shaky at best, this is a solid read for people interested in basketball and those of us who are *just* about to get to long-term financial planning. xf0x9fx90xb0 The Rabbit Hole by Blas MorosI donxe2x80x99t know where this guy finds the time, but Moros has published his notes on hundreds of books, including ones that Ixe2x80x99ve written about here, like Loonshots and Range. If you want the lessons but donxe2x80x99t want to do all that reading, this is the best resource I have found. xf0x9fx92xb0 Lessons from Jeff Jordan, Whoxe2x80x99s Seen it All Before in FortunePolina Marinova is one of the top 5 journalists covering VC and tech - she is a Fortune editor who is the author of two great newsletters, The Term Sheet, a daily from Fortune mainly focused on venture investments, and The Profile, her own weekly highlighting the best profiles on the internet.In Lessons from Jeff Jordan, she writes a profile of her own, landing a rare interview with a16z partner Jeff Jordan. Jordan spent over 20 years as an operator - at Disney, eBay and OpenTable - before becoming a venture capitalist and investing in iconic companies like Airbnb, Pinterest and Instacart. His experience on both sides of the table makes for an educational and entertaining read. Live Threads Follow-up If you follow me on Twitter, it was hard to miss my experiment with Live Threads. Starting with a flood of tweets early Monday morning, I tweeted nearly 80 times over the course of the week. Whatxe2x80x99s worse, each time I added a tweet to a thread, the whole thread would show up in my followers feeds. Sorry and thanks for bearing with me. At the end of the week, I took a poll to get a sense for how people felt about the format: The good news: I picked up a bunch of followers who are interested in the topics I created threads on; half of the poll respondents liked the format.The bad news: the other half either hated the Threads or didnxe2x80x99t care. The takeaway: Ixe2x80x99m going to add to the Threads much more judiciously going forward, and will keep searching for better ways to group and share content. Suggestions welcome!Whatxe2x80x99s Next? Ixe2x80x99m heading to Avalon to spend the 4th of July weekend with my family. Ixe2x80x99ll also be furiously refreshing Debate Club form submissions to see if we can make this happen. As always, if youxe2x80x99re enjoying this newsletter, I would really appreciate it if you shared it with friends who you think would like it too.

This is the first Per My Last E-mail of official summer, and I hope youxe2x80x99ve all been able to take some time to unwind, relax and recharge. This past weekend, a group of us went up to our friendxe2x80x99s place in Clintonxe2x80x99s Corner, NY, and we were so happy to be together in the woods that we were doing cartwheels. Live ThreadsSince I started writing this newsletter 6 weeks ago, I have been hunting for interesting and informative articles, podcasts, books and videos to share with all of you. Itxe2x80x99s been really cool hearing your reactions, discussing ideas, and reading and listening to related content that youxe2x80x99ve sent me, but normally after a few days, wexe2x80x99re on to the next thing. I have always had a pretty bad memory, and recently, the topic of what I can do to better retain and apply the information Ixe2x80x99m consuming has fascinated me. Part of the issue as far as I can tell is that I read something once, think about it for a few minutes, hope part of it sticks somewhere in my brain, and then move on. A major reason that I started writing is that it forces me to engage more actively with the information I consume, knowing that I will have to try to apply it in novel, cohesive and insightful ways. In an effort to engage with and organize content in a more lightweight way than, and as a supplement to, writing, Ixe2x80x99m playing around with Live Threads on Twitter. The idea is to create threads on topics Ixe2x80x99m exploring - from Natively Integrated Companies to Real Estate to Startup Strategy - that I can update as I discover new things and that others can contribute to with me. To learn more and follow along, you can check out the short post I wrote about it here. Links and Listensxf0x9fx8fxab Better Schools Wonxe2x80x99t Fix America by Nick Hanauer in The AtlanticHanauer, long a supporter of education as the path to equality, realizes that he has been getting it backwards for most of his life. He argues that better education alone wonxe2x80x99t lead to shrinking income and opportunity gaps, and that itxe2x80x99s actually higher wages and more economic security that will lead to better educational outcomes. xf0x9fx91xb9 The Greatest Asset Bubble of All-Time by Nick Maggiulli of Of Dollars and DataOf Dollars and Data is one of my favorite blogs, and this post is a good example of why that is. Maggiulli takes a structured approach to determining which is the greatest asset bubble of all time based on Market Cap, Price, and Recovery Time. He compares Tulip Mania, South Sea, The Great Crash, Japan, Dot Com, U.S. Housing and Bitcoin and picks a clear winner. Without looking, can you guess which is the greatest asset bubble of all time? xe2x99xbbxefxb8x8f Five Lessons of History by Morgan Housel of Collaborative FundHousel, one of the best thinkers online today, points out that most lessons people take from history are not broadly applicable, and are therefore almost useless. For example, looking back at the Great Depression, what is the average person supposed to learn? xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m not a banker or a regulator. So what can I do with a lesson like xe2x80x98donxe2x80x99t let the banks fail?xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d Housel goes on to lay out 5 lessons from history that anyone can apply to their lives. My favorite is: xe2x80x9cLesson #4: Progress happens too slowly for people to notice; setbacks happen too fast for people to ignore.xe2x80x9d This is an idea that I keep seeing pop up, maybe because wexe2x80x99re in year 10 of a bull run, and one that Ixe2x80x99m trying to figure out how to apply.  xf0x9fx8ex99 Bill Gurley on The Twenty Minute VC with Harry Stebbings Bill Gurley is one of the best VCs alive and is most famous for his early investment in, and later power struggle with, Uber. In this podcast, Gurley shares some lessons and perspective hexe2x80x99s gained over twenty years in venture, but most interesting to me is a point he makes that echoes Houselxe2x80x99s Lesson #4:xe2x80x9cOver maybe a 5-year period, your VC firm has taken on a tremendous amount of risk, but every day youxe2x80x99ve just moved a little bitxe2x80xa6 when markets bust, risk aversion comes on immediately. Like boom.xe2x80x9d xf0x9fx95xb8 The Network Effects Manual by James Currier of NFXxe2x80x9cNetwork Effectsxe2x80x9d are one of the most talked about and least truly understood concepts in tech. Everyone claims to have network effects in their business, and for good reason: Currier points out that xe2x80x9cOur three-year study, which we released recently, shows that nfx are responsible for 70% of the value created by tech companies since the Internet became a thing in 1994.xe2x80x9d This breakdown of the 13 different types of network effects adds clarity and nuance to a conversation that has lacked both. xf0x9fx91xaexf0x9fx8fxbb Drug Cop Worth $400 million After Bets on Brooklyn Real Estate by Sophie Alexander and Tom Maloney in Bloomberg Nothing makes me wish that I had a time machine more than hearing about people buying New York properties ~30-50 years ago for a few thousand dollars. This one, though, is actually feel-good. Bloomberg covers Greg Oxe2x80x99Connell, a former drug cop who started buying properties in Red Hook in 1967. Oxe2x80x99Connell still lives in the neighborhood today, and he and his son run their portfolio with an eye towards preserving the community over maximizing profits. xf0x9fx98xad Stay in the Game by Drew Dickson of Albert Bridge Capital Ixe2x80x99m not going to give anything away, but this post by a dad about his sonxe2x80x99s struggles and recovery is one of the best stories Ixe2x80x99ve read this year, and the ending is a really nice surprise. Whatxe2x80x99s NextThis week, Ixe2x80x99m going to play with these Live Threads to see if they make sense as a way to share content. My early take is that itxe2x80x99s too messy to be followable, but Ixe2x80x99ll let it go for a week and let you know what Ixe2x80x99ve learned in the next newsletter.

I said last week that Ixe2x80x99d be sticking to a Sunday cadence, but a few of you mentioned that you like getting the newsletter on Mondays better, and I have the open rates to back that up. Jeff Bezos believes that the smartest people change their minds in the face of new facts. So Monday it is! Dads Being DadsIxe2x80x99m writing to you from beautiful New Jersey, where spent Saturday with my Dad and Sunday with Pujaxe2x80x99s for Fatherxe2x80x99s Day. When we got a flat tire driving between our two houses on Sunday morning, Puja and I both pulled out our phones to call our dads and ask them what to do. They knew how to change a tire, and how to deal with a tire that wouldnxe2x80x99t come off, off the top of their heads, without having to look at a YouTube video. Dads are the best. What Ixe2x80x99m ReadingI finished listening to Exhalation by Ted Chiang (which was excellent and I highly recommend listening to), and it got me hooked on sci-fi short stories. So up next on the list is Radicalized by Cory Doctorow, the author of I, Robot. Someone on twitter described it as xe2x80x9cBlack Mirror with actual people instead of soulless sociopaths.xe2x80x9d Good enough for me. Ixe2x80x99m still reading Range by David Epstein. Normally I speed through books and forget half of what I read, but Ixe2x80x99m really enjoying taking this one slow, taking notes and trying to internalize its lessons. Which may be for the best - Epstein points out that people who study something, put it away for a while to do other things, and then come back to it are more likely to remember it for longer than people who chunk all of their studying in one session. Links and Listensxf0x9fx8fxa2 The I in We by Reeves Wiedeman in New York Mag IntelligencerArticles on WeWork have become appointment reading for me, and this may be the best one yet (so good that both Mike and Sudhir sent it to me - thank you!). WeWork articles are interesting to me professionally because they operate in the same industry as Breather, have grown at breakneck speed, and are the most talked-about company in our space. Where they really get me, though, are on a personal level. I canxe2x80x99t get enough of Adam Neumann quotes. My favorite from the New York Mag article has Neumann painting WeWork in the role of international peacemaker: xe2x80x9cI need to have the biggest valuation I can, because when countries are shooting at each other, I want them to come to me.xe2x80x9dThere are more gems in this article than there are in Aladdinxe2x80x99s Cave of Wonders. Read it. xf0x9fx93x88When Everything That Counts Canxe2x80x99t Be Counted by Josh BrownIn this excellent article that blends finance and some of the concepts that I wrote about in The Rise of the Natively Integrated Company, Josh Brown explores a question that investment market historian William Bernstein asked him: xe2x80x9cWhat if the cost of capital never rises again?xe2x80x9d This opposite of this question is one that I hinted about at the end of the piece on NICs - what happens to NIC when cheap money isnxe2x80x99t so freely available? Brownxe2x80x99s thoughts on Bernsteinxe2x80x99s question bode well for NICs. He sees that companies like WeWork, Airbnb, Amazon, and Netflix are achieving much higher multiples than their older competitors because they own ongoing relationships with their users and focus on things that even free money canxe2x80x99t buy, like intellectual property and brand. The same argument can also apply to private-market NICs like Harryxe2x80x99s, Zeus and Epidemic Sound - companies who focus on building brands, relationships with customers, and whose value chains are constructed in such a way that itxe2x80x99s nearly impossible for competitors to imitate by spending money alone. xf0x9fx93xb2Mary Meekerxe2x80x99s 2019 Internet TrendsSince she started putting it out in 1995, Mary Meekerxe2x80x99s Internet Trends report is always one of the most anticipated and most discussed documents in tech.

Only 2-3 hours to go!  Natively Integrated CompaniesAs the capstone for my writing class, I wrote a 3-part series on The Rise of the Natively Integrated Company. In it, I explore the shift from businesses that focused on controlling supply, to those that focus on controlling demand, and ultimately, to Natively Integrated Companies: companies that combine the focus on building quality products that old-school businesses had with the focus on owning relationships with customers that companies like Airbnb, Zillow, and Netflix do. I spoke on a real estate tech panel at Blackstone a few months ago. In response to one of the questions about how our businesses could become asset light, I replied that Breather was actually pretty heavy - we lease space, have in-house design and construction teams, manage our own operations, build our own tech, and build direct relationships with our customers via phenomenal customer care, sales and marketing teams - and that our heaviness was the key to creating a superior, differentiated experience. Afterwards, one of our investors, who I hadnxe2x80x99t seen in the audience, came up to me and said xe2x80x9cGreat job up there. But I hated your answer about being heavy.xe2x80x9d In a way, this series is my 8,000 word response.This is the longest piece I have written, and it reflects the experience Ixe2x80x99ve gained at Breather and lessons Ixe2x80x99ve learned following other startups closely. I hope youxe2x80x99ll check it out, let me know what you learned, let me know what you disagree with, and if you like it, share it with people who would enjoy it.xf0x9fx9axa8 Athens Airbnb Update xf0x9fx9axa8Our house in Athens is live on Airbnb!

The book is a series of science fiction short stories that Meghan recommended to me. The author Alan Moore describes Exhalation better than I can: xe2x80x9cAs much thought experiments as stories, Ted Chiangxe2x80x99s exquisite mechanisms employ science fiction as an instrument to probe the human condition. Like the chronicler of Exhalationxe2x80x99s title narrative, he opens the back of his own head and lays bare its mysterious golden motion for the hushed appreciation of an awestruck audience. Beautifully written and conceived, this is a marvelous, astonishing collection that we would do well to read before the worlds it conjures are upon us.

I have read a lot of the negative press on Uber, and have even written about the challenges of their business model in my Shen Yun and Why There Wonxe2x80x99t Be Any New Aggregators posts, but Ixe2x80x99ve never read anything so convincing from the anti-Uber camp. Horan essentially argues that Uber is one of the greatest examples of Greater Fool Theory - aka xe2x80x9cI donxe2x80x99t need to think that this business will actually make money to buy the stock as long as there is some greater fool who will buy it from me at a higher price laterxe2x80x9d - and that they have optimized for xe2x80x9cgrowth at all costsxe2x80x9d from the beginning. Growth means more investment which means more subsidies which means more riders which means more growth which means more investment which means that Uber has been able to put off dealing with the fundamental underlying challenges that come with running a transportation business. Horan thinks that Uber has been a net negative and that regulated taxi businesses werenxe2x80x99t as dumb as they looked. If youxe2x80x99re interested at all in Uberxe2x80x99s story or startup economics, this long-ish article is worth the time. xf0x9fx8fx80 Data, Decisions and Basketball with Sam Hinkie on Invest Like the BestThis replay of an interview Patrick Oxe2x80x99Shaughnessy did with former Sixers General Manager Sam Hinkie a little over a year ago popped into my feed again this week. If you havenxe2x80x99t listened to Hinkie speak before, or read his resignation letter, itxe2x80x99s surprising to hear an NBA GM speak so fluently about markets, machine learning, books, hiring, and innovation. One of my dreams is to work with Sam Hinkie one day, and this podcast is a good example of why that is. xf0x9fx8fx83xf0x9fx8fxbc The Heart of a Swimmer vs. The Heart of a Runner in The New York TimesOnce upon a time, I was a good runner and I have always been a terrible swimmer. I was hoping that this Times article would tell me that as a runner, I have the heart of a champion. It didnxe2x80x99t. What it said instead is, xe2x80x9cWhile all of the athletesxe2x80x99 left ventricles filled with blood earlier than average and untwisted more quickly during each heartbeat, those desirable changes were amplified in the runners.xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99ll take it. xf0x9fx92xb0 50 Things Ixe2x80x99ve Learned in the First 90 Days of Running a Company by Romeen ShethRomeen Sheth just finished his first 90 days running Metasys, and he shares 50 things that he learned and brought to the job. My three favorites are:You donxe2x80x99t have to rely on yourself to develop instinctsCuriosity is the best predictor of performanceStart with imagination, end with logicBonus: I realized at the end that Romeen is a Duke alum. Knew I liked that guy. xf0x9fx91x80 An Optical Illusion that Will ZigZag Your Brain in SyFy WireOptical illusions are always fun, and this article on one even asks about aliens, xe2x80x9cHow will the stochastic constructions of their own brains (assuming they even have brains like we do) separate them from us in ways we cannot even fathom?xe2x80x9dWhatxe2x80x99s NextThis week, Ixe2x80x99m working on the Loonshots course and starting some follow-up posts on Natively Integrated Companies.

Today's Per My Last E-mail is a day late because Puja and I spent the weekend in Athens, NY closing on, and launching, a soon-to-be AirBnB. (For more on Brooklyn people migrating upstate, check out the NY Times piece, Is the Hudson Valley Turning into the Hamptons?)Pictured: The two newest Brooklynites in the Hudson ValleyWe're going to try to optimize our way to the top of the Athens' search results by the end of summer. If we learn anything particularly helpful or interesting, I'll share some insights here. Puja is a superhero - she led the negotiations, locked in a mortgage rate so low that it was a topic of conversation among our lawyers at closing, designed the house, ordered all of the furniture, invited her parents to visit and help out (thank you!) and coordinated deliveries so that seven different vendors brought everything we needed to Athens, NY in a 48-hour window. Because of everything she's pulled off, our place will be live on AirBnB and ready for guests by the time I send next week's email. My sister, Meghan, stopped on her road trip back from Boston to deliver some furniture and lend a hand. Less than 24 hours after graduating with an MPA from Harvard Kennedy School, Meggles spent an hour sanding a hole in our door with a drill bit to make our smart lock fit after I couldn't figure out how to make it happen. My biggest takeaway from the weekend: Girls rule and boys drool. What I'm ReadingI'm about 3% of the way into Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein, the author of The Sports Gene. 3% in is probably too early to comment on the book, but Epstein's interview on Invest Like the Best whet my appetite when he argued that the 10,000 hour rule is bullshit and dove into the research on effective learning. If I were a betting man (I am), Ixe2x80x99d bet Ixe2x80x99m going to like it. If you're reading Range or want to start now, let me know and Ixe2x80x99ll set up a mini-book club discussion (looking at you, Coop and Evan).Links & Listensxf0x9fx8dx94 Joe Beef and the Excesses of Restaurant Culture by Hannah Goldfield for The New YorkerRestaurant culture - specifically, how top chefs can perform at the top of their field while drinking and doing drugs to excess and barely sleeping - has fascinated me since reading Anthony Bourdainxe2x80x99s Kitchen Confidential. And Joe Beef is perpetually #1 on my xe2x80x9cRestaurants I need to go to next time Ixe2x80x99m in Montrealxe2x80x9d list. Goldfieldxe2x80x99s piece captures the Joe Beefxe2x80x99s wine-fueled ride to becoming one of the worldxe2x80x99s best restaurants, and more interestingly, the sober realizations of its partner-chefs David McMillan and Frxc3xa9dxc3xa9ric Morin. The piece asks the reader to reflect on the question of whether people who have perpetuated a certain culture should be lauded or scorned for later calling out the evils of that culture.xf0x9fx99x85xf0x9fx8fxbbxe2x80x8dxe2x99x82xefxb8x8f Google Chrome, the Perfect Antitrust Villain? by Alex DancoOn the eve that news that the DOJ would be investigating Googlexe2x80x99s search practices broke, Alex Danco wrote a piece on why Chrome isnxe2x80x99t just the most logical target for antitrust action within Google, itxe2x80x99s the most logical target for antitrust action in the entire tech industry. xf0x9fx91x82xf0x9fx8fxbc Kulveer Taggar (Zeus Living) and Rebecca Kaden (USV) on The Twenty Minute VCDouble-whammy from Twenty Minute VC this week.As I was searching for a protagonist for a final case study in my upcoming post on Natively Integrated Companies, Harry Stebbingsxe2x80x99 interview with Kulveer Taggar of Zeus Living landed in my podcast feed like manna from heaven. Taggar clearly describes the many competencies that successful tech-enabled companies must build and the tools and systems they use to manage the related complexity. I first listened to this 20 Minute VC interview with Rebecca Kaden of USV a few months ago. As I started writing about Natively Integrated Companies, her ideas kept coming back to me. In the podcast, she talks about why startups arenxe2x80x99t going to beat Amazon at its own game, and how they can build great businesses despite that by building direct customer relationships and products that people love and share.  xf0x9fx94xac Science: The Endless Frontier by Vannevar BushItxe2x80x99s rare (read: never) that I finish reading a book and decide to dive into some of the source material. But in Loonshots, Safi Bahcall makes a bold claim about Science: The Endless Frontier, Vannevar Bushxe2x80x99s proposal to President Truman to continue government support of science after WW2: xe2x80x9cSince the end of World War II, hundreds of industry-changing, or industry-creating, discoveries originating in the US - including GPS, personal computers, the biotechnology industry, the internet, pacemakers, artificial hearts, magnetic resonance imaging, the chemotherapy cure for childhood leukemia, even the original Google search algorithm - sprang from the system Bushxe2x80x99s report inspired.Given everything the report has given us, it is well worth the two-hour read. xf0x9fx96x8d Sketched Books by Sacha ChuaI first stumbled on Sketched Books on Sam Hinkiexe2x80x99s website a couple of weeks ago, and have gone down a sketched rabbit hole ever since. Chua condenses popular books into one-page sketches that visually outline the key ideas, giving you the insights without the repetition and fluff common in business books. Her sketch of How to Read a Book is meta, and a good place to start. What's Next? This week, Ixe2x80x99ll be publishing The Rise of the Natively Integrated Company. It will be the longest piece Ixe2x80x99ve written yet by a wide margin, and Ixe2x80x99m looking forward to feedback on it, even if the feedback is xe2x80x9cYou should probably stop publishing what you write, bud.xe2x80x9d After that, Ixe2x80x99ll be working on creating a mini-course based off of Loonshots. And wexe2x80x99ll be hitting the launch button on our Athens AirBnB. (You better believe Ixe2x80x99m going to use the massive reach and power of this e-mail list to push that thing.)

I hope all of you are on a beach somewhere not checking e-mail. But if you're looking for something to keep your brain lightly engaged while you sunbathe (or sit in traffic on the way home), I've pulled together a few of the best things that I have read, listened to, and written this week. (Editor's Note: Reading this while listening to my pick for Song of the Summer, 2019: I Don't Care by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber)What do Shen Yun and Startups Have in Common? My Latest Post: Startup Economics Lessons from Shen Yunxe2x80x99s Ad EmpireShen Yun has fascinated me from the moment I first saw their subway ads and began noticing their posters everywhere. This week, I dove in and explored the math behind Shen Yun's ad spend and what it can teach us about startup economics. My Beach Readxf0x9fx8cx9d I'm about half of the way through Loonshots by Safi Bahcall and I'm picking up more insights per page than I can remember getting from any book I've read in the past year. One of the most fascinating things that Ixe2x80x99ve learned from Loonshots is that the US Government used to tap celebrities and CEOs as spies, using their industry knowledge and ability to gain access to important people to help win wars. Did you know that Polaroid Founder & CEO, Edwin Land, helped create the first spy plane, the U-2, and the use of digital photography in satellites, in the 1950s? Or that world-famous pilot Charles Lindbergh used his cachet to convince a German engineer to hand over the designs to Germanyxe2x80x99s jet engines to the Americans during WW2? We didnxe2x80x99t learn about these episodes until documents were declassified many years later. I wonder which current CEOs and celebrities are undercover spies right now. To spread stories like these and help people retain the bookxe2x80x99s lessons for nurturing loonshots and keeping companies innovative as they grow, I am planning to put together a quick Loonshots course like the one I did for the Process. Start reading now so that you're ready for the quizzes when they come out in a couple of weeks. 15 Minutes of Fire Rainbow Famexf0x9fx94xa5xf0x9fx8cx88 I took this picture of a type of rainbow Ixe2x80x99d never seen before on the beach in Avalon yesterday. I tweeted the picture with the caption, xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99ve never seen a rainbow like this. What is it?xe2x80x9d Not really expecting an answer, I learned that this is a Circumhorizontal Arc, or Fire Rainbow. More surprisingly, local and national news desks somehow discovered the picture and reached out for permission to use it in their coverage of the fire rainbow. So far, the picture has been used in articles and segments from Gothamist, ABC 6 Philadelphia, NBC4 New York, CBS 3 Philadelphia (TV segment), PIX11 New York, a whole bunch of local ABC and CBS affiliates, NJ.com, Accuweather, and the Ocean City Patch, with more outlets sliding into my DMs by the minute. Long story short, Ixe2x80x99ve used up my 15 minutes of fame on a fire rainbow picture. Twitter is a wild place. xf0x9fx98x82Links & Listens xf0x9fx8fxa9 Oral History of the Booking.com Acquisition by Skift With so many people traveling this weekend, it seems like an appropriate time to learn about how Priceline's acquisitions of two relatively small European travel booking platforms created the $100 billion OTA juggernaut that is Booking.com. xf0x9fx8fx86 The Vertical Brand by Web Smith If you know me (and most of you on here do), you know that the two things I am most obsessed with are Philly sports and startup strategy. This article checks both boxes, diving into how Sixers co-owner Michael Rubin's company, Fanatics, has become \"one of the most successful digitally native brands on the market by protecting intellectual property, achieving manufacturing superiority, and emphasizing industry-leading fulfillment operations.\" Michael Rubin just seems like a great guy. Check out his interview on Pardon My Take here.xf0x9fx92xbb How Does Quantum Computing Work by Andy Matsuchak and Michael NielsenAndy is the same person who wrote the Why Books Don't Work article that I posted last week. I'm quickly becoming obsessed with his work. This one uses the \"experimental mnemonic medium, which makes it almost effortless to remember\" the principles of Quantum Computing. I wouldn't say that it's effortless or that I am now an expert in Quantum Computing, but I love Matsuchak's explorations of new methods of learning and retaining information. xf0x9fx8fxa2Change Order Podcast with Zach Aarons Interviewed on David Friedlanderxe2x80x99s Change Order Podcast, MetaProp co-founder Zach Aarons gives an insightful and entertaining overview of the PropTech space. If youxe2x80x99ve ever wondered what I do, listening to this will get you a step closer. h/t to Dror for the recommendation.xf0x9fx8ex93 Ixe2x80x99m working on my capstone project for the Write of Passage course, a deep dive into Natively Integrated Companies: companies who are born from day 1 with a focus on owning and integrating supply and demand (think Harryxe2x80x99s, Sonder, Breather, Epidemic Sound, and Away) instead of owning demand while modularizing supply (like Uber, AirBnB, and Facebook). Itxe2x80x99s very much a work-in-progress right now, so if you have any ideas on this topic and want to chat, let me know.

I hope it entertains you and gives you some new things to think about. Puja asked me to add her parents to the list after reading a draft, so I feel better about it not being completely terrible at least.Ixe2x80x99m taking a writing course called Write of Passage and this weekxe2x80x99s assignment is to get 20 people to sign up for my newsletter (check. thank you!) and to send you all a personal update e-mail. This has been the hardest assignment yet for me because it means actually having to ask all of you to sign up and read what I write, but Trust the Process. So first things first, what have I been up to? xe2x9cx88xefxb8x8f Puja and I just got back from an amazing 10-day trip in Israel, first in Jerusalem, then in Akko (the oldest continually-inhabited city in the world), and finally in Tel Aviv - now officially on the list of places that I would live if I moved abroad. The weather was perfect, we stayed in an AirBnB 1 minute away from the beach, I finally learned what the scooter craze is all about, and the food lived up to the hype. xf0x9fx8exa4 Side Note: The most excited I saw people get on the whole trip was when Donxe2x80x99t Stop Me Now came on at Kuli Alma. Bohemian Rhapsody has made Queen the worldxe2x80x99s favorite band 40 years after Donxe2x80x99t Stop Me Now was released. xf0x9fx8fxa2 At Breather, wexe2x80x99re fully focused on building the newest evolution of our product, flexible office spaces, and I am really proud of the work the team has done to launch what I think are the most productive spaces available. Check out a few here, here, and here. xe2x9cx8dxf0x9fx8fxbb And obviously, Ixe2x80x99m taking this writing course. Ixe2x80x99m taking it mainly because I want to get better at making sense of the information I consume to develop my own point-of-view. The unexpected benefit so far is that itxe2x80x99s pushing me to be less of a wimp; assignments like this one force me to share my thoughts with people I respect (thatxe2x80x99s you!) and get over the fear that what Ixe2x80x99m putting out there isnxe2x80x99t novel or valuable. And because I have to put it out there, itxe2x80x99s forcing me to take the time to make my writing more novel and valuable. xf0x9fxa4x93 The first piece I wrote for the course was an introduction to Ben Thompson, and if you check it out, I would love your feedback. xf0x9fx8fx80 Outside of the course but now up on my site, I pulled together a bunch of the best content I could find on the Process - the Sixers journey from mediocre to terrible to really good - and packaged it into a course, quizzes and all. If youxe2x80x99ve ever wanted an online degree in an obscure basketball-related topic, this is your chance. OK, phew. Done with the personal update piece. Thanks for bearing with me. From here on out, this newsletter will be a curated list of the things that Ixe2x80x99m reading, listening to, watching, thinking about and writing. A few from this week: xf0x9fx93x9a Why books donxe2x80x99t work by Andy MatuschakMatuschak argues that xe2x80x9cBooks are surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge,xe2x80x9d and that we can and should make new forms instead. As someone who reads a lot and absorbs about 5% of what I read, this one hits close to home. xf0x9fx9ax80 The Galactic Tourist Industrial Complex on LeVar Burton Reads If you loved Reading Rainbow, youxe2x80x99ll love LeVar Burton reading you short stories on his podcast.xf0x9fxa4x96 AGI Has Been Delayed by Rodney BrooksI read xe2x80x98The Singularity is Nearxe2x80x99 by Ray Kurzweil in college, and was convinced that robots would be smarter than humans in my lifetime. Brooks argues that, based on an insiderxe2x80x99s prediction that driverless cars will be integrated onto our roads over the next 30-50 years, we will not see human-level AGI until 2200 or 2300. xf0x9fx93x89 Uber IPO Woes Stem from a Lack of Innovation by Bradley Tusk Bradley Tusk, an early Uber investor and advisor and one of the people behind De Blasio Mode, argues that while Dara Khosrowshahixe2x80x99s softer approach works with the media, Travis Kalanickxe2x80x99s more ambitious and innovative approach might have worked better with public market investors.xf0x9fx92xb8 The Uber IPO by AcquiredThe Acquired podcast does deep dives on tech M&A and IPOs. This episode goes over the history of the taxi industry, Uberxe2x80x99s story and what will make Uberxe2x80x99s IPO successful or unsuccessful in the coming years. Fun fact: Henry Allen started the first taxi company in NYC in 1907. In 1908, his drivers went on strike to be treated like employees, even though they were essentially independent contractors. History repeats itself. xf0x9fx8cx8e AR Will Spark the Next Big Platform - Call it Mirrorworld  by Kevin KellyIxe2x80x99m cheating a bit here, because I read this a couple of months ago, but Mirrorworld is an eye-opening glimpse at what the world could look like in a decade and beyond by one of techxe2x80x99s best writers. xf0x9fx90xb2 What We Need from the Game of Thrones Finale by WiredBooks, Uber and the future of humanity are interesting or whatever, but today is really all about the Game of Thrones Finale. The Wired staff discusses what they need to see out of the finale to feel satisfied with how the series wraps up. Spoilers, obviously. xf0x9fx91xaf If youxe2x80x99ve seen the Shen Yun posters and youxe2x80x99re like me, youxe2x80x99ve probably asked xe2x80x9cHow is a dance performance paying for omnipresent advertising?xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99m working on a post comparing Shen Yun to VC-backed startups and hope to have it out by the next newsletter.

I was going through my xe2x80x9ckung fuxe2x80x9d phase and I just couldnxe2x80x99t get enough Kung Fu movies.  Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, and 100s of Shaw Brothers films.  I saw them all, but xe2x80x9cBig trouble in little Chinaxe2x80x9d has a special place in my heart.Watching it again after many years, brought back a lot of emotions.  Fear of Lo Pan, amusement from a constant stream of Jack Burton one-liners, and the godlike powers of three storms.  This movie had a lot of everything that we call movie magic.Here is the fiddle that implements Cosmos DB repository and shows the RUs cost of different Cosmos DB actions:https://dotnetfiddle.net/z9evjFCosmos DB is a NoSQL database hosted on Azure. It is different from SQL databases like xe2x80x9cSQL Serverxe2x80x9d in several major ways.Flexible schemaCosmo DB is a document database meaning that records are stored as JSON documents and not as rows in tables. This allows to add or stop using record properties without having to modify the database schema.Scales horizontally Unlike SQL Server which is scaled vertically, the CosmosDB is scaled horizontally.  That means we can just keep adding new servers which add more storage and processing power to DB.Short latency for geo-distributionFor global applications, it is good to place keep the data close to where your users are.  Cosmos DB makes it easy to do so by creating local replicas of your DB where you can read and write data.    Multiple APIsCosmos DB supports multiple database APIs including the native Core (SQL) API, API for MongoDB, Cassandra API, Gremlin API, and Table API.  So if you have past experience with MongoDB, you can use MongoDB API.  I usually just stick to Core(SQL), since it has much better support from MS than other APIs.Archimedes once said: xe2x80x9cGive me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world. xe2x80x9c  I know what you are thinking.  What the hell is the fulcrum? xe2x80xa6With Cosmos DB the lever is measured in RUs (no, not Rubles, Request Units). You can perform small actions using only 1 or 10 RUs, but for more complicated actions you can go all the way up to 10000 RUs or more.

It has a lot more action than the original, but also plenty of scares and even some comedy.   I watched it recently and I am happy to report that it has really stood the test of time.  I laughed, I cried, I crawled into a ball and whimpered lightly when the Alien found me and opened its mouth. Luckily Ripley appeared and kicked Alienxe2x80x99s ass.Fortunately, there were never any sequels/prequels to these two amazing movies, or that would besmirch the saga of Alien/Aliens.At this point, everyone already has Google Speaker or Amazon Alexa at home.  You can ask it for todayxe2x80x99s weather or to sing you a song, but what else can you do with it?To extend Google Speaker/Assistant, there is a Google Actions framework, which lets developers create custom google actions.

Very few discussions, however, are about which institution has shown the potential to become the next Berkshire Hathaway.The continuous cash flows and leverage provided from the insurance arm has been one of most important factors for Buffetxe2x80x99s stable long term investment returns. In the digital age, it is Amazon, rather than most money managers or financial institutions, that has been operating in a more similar way to Berkshire Hathaway, by combining stable strong cash flows + very smart asset allocationxefxbcx8eJeff Bezos is a mastermind in growth investing, by deeply understanding the how business models evolve over time and having the incredible patience over a very long period, both are very relatable to Warren Buffet.While Amazonxe2x80x99s success in its asset allocation has been more reflected in the aggregated growth and diversities in its revenue streams, we think it is Tencent, the Chinese social network giant, quite unnoticeably, has been showing not only the genius in smart money distribution, but more importantly the wisdom in balancing between sucking their invested companies into Tencentxe2x80x99s ecosystem to order to add numbers to their balance sheet vs.Letting their investments operate independently, giving help only when needed, and observing like an old-school value investor.Even though therexe2x80x99s no sign of slowing down in Tencentxe2x80x99s core business, and strong innovations in its product development has been very impressive in the extremely competitive Chinese market, we think Tencentxe2x80x99s strategic investment team is a true gem, and its investment book really has the potential to help the company grow into the new Berkshire Hathaway in the digital era, to make Tencent a unique and once in a generation investment as at early 2021.Tech companies have three major advantages over companies like Berkshire Hathaway or traditional money managers in investing post 2010, that makes us think the new Berkshire Hathaway in the digital age has to be a great tech company first.The three advantages are: 1) Proprietary data 2) Expertise knowledge3) (No) asset-liability issueData: It is so obvious that I think almost every tech company that generates proprietary data should be in the business of investment, leveraging unique insight that could be derived. Traditional financial institutions can only use public information supposedly, and they seek edge over competitors by looking at alternative data to create information advantage. Tech companies, especially platforms or aggregators, are inherently built to have unfair positions to make observations on web traffics, user behaviours, order flows, app downloads and all kinds of digital & physical activities that are exclusively available to them only. This allows them not only to know who/what is currently doing well, but also where to look for the next cool thing. This data-mismatching gap between tech investors and traditional public investors is only getting bigger and bigger: as tech companies acquire more stakes in other tech companies, the likely data-sharing will not only help the invested grow better, but in turn help the investors get better insights, and go on to make better future investment. Itxe2x80x99s like an investment flywheel effect, with a positive feedback loop of data input -> investment decision -> investment outcome -> more investments -> more data input -> ...This huge advantage cannot be stressed enough and is primarily why big tech companies have been and will continue to be far better investors than most other types of investors, though therexe2x80x99s yet to be a clear way to calculate those impressive investment returns for most of them.Knowledge:Great investors make non-consensus calls by understanding what most donxe2x80x99t. It is essentially a knowledge mismatch, no matter how that was acquired. Tech companies, inherently from how they are built and grow, are usually equipped with far better understandings of the problems and possible technological solutions in their special field: whatxe2x80x99s the real pain point? Whatxe2x80x99s the current engineering limitations, what techniques are truly innovative ...etc. In other words, scientists understand science better, and engineers understand engineering better, than most generalist investors.  Such xe2x80x9chard knowledgexe2x80x9d advantage combined with the data advantage, can also lead to better understanding of business models and the real potential of a product. Itxe2x80x99s not much different to an investment bank hiring Biology PHDs to cover healthcare stocks - Tech companies just have far less financial modelers, and far more industrial experts when it comes to their investment decision making.Similar to the data flywheel effect, therexe2x80x99s also a knowledge flywheel or positive feedback loop that is getting created here, in certain cases equally or more powerful as it also helps to build a talent network & brainpower that are not usually accessible to traditional investors.(No) asset-liability issue:Almost all money managers, if accepting external capitals, are facing the issue of matching Assets vs. Liabilities. To meet return hurdles and liquidity requirements from the liability side, be it client flows or insurance payouts, traditional investors are usually tied up with many more constraints.Ability to generate their own cash = having much greater flexibility. Tech companies that are investing their own excessive amount of capital can make much more concentrated bets and be a lot more patient, both of which have been proven ways to beat the market.Generating probably the humongous amount of valuable data, Having elite level of understanding of both software engineering, and product building (contrary to Facebookxe2x80x99s acquisition strategy, Tencent has a reputation of building great products in-house), And sitting on huge cash pile thatxe2x80x99s keep adding every quarter, Tencent couldnxe2x80x99t be a better example to study how it invests.Over the period from 2014 to 2019, for every 100 dollars generated from its operating cash, Tencent has spent almost every single dollar into investment, thatxe2x80x99s right a 100/100.  This number for Aliaba is 80/100, for Amazon itxe2x80x99s 63/100,  for Google & Facebook itxe2x80x99s 54/100, for Microsoft itxe2x80x99s 30/100. And for Apple, itxe2x80x99s negative 66/100, meaning they have spent most of their cash in stock buybacks rather than investing out.As a result, as of June-2020, a whopping 49% of Tencentxe2x80x99s total assets are the book value of its investments, with a split of  57% in public market and 43% in private market.Given the nature of its core business, a lot of investments are early stage companies, and a lot of investments are in the Media and Gaming sectors. Yet we can still clearly see that:C-round & later + Strategic investments account for almost 50% of its total investment. This is due to the size issue more recently but also that Tencentxe2x80x99s investment style already tends to be more xe2x80x9cfinancialxe2x80x9d than xe2x80x9cacquisitionalxe2x80x9d. This is the balance we talked about that Tencent has and differs itself to most other Tech companies in investing. Instead of getting hands dirty into operations of the business they put money into, Tencentxe2x80x99s vision in its capital deploying is closer to Berkshire Hathaway: smarter allocation and let good operators run.The overall investments, after heavy weights in Media and Gaming, are still pretty diversified. The diversification is justified by that social is such a big part of many things, but the pursuit of risk-adjusted financial success is pretty obvious here: instead of purely adding gun powers to their core revenue generators, they are building a balanced equity book. (They have disclosed no single investmentxe2x80x99s book value is more than 5% of its total assets)Itxe2x80x99s rather a little complicated how Tencent presents their investments using different accounting measures. Out of their financial report as at 30-Jun-2020, I regrouped various investment related entries into below table:So based on its June 2020 reporting, Tencent already had more than 114 billion USD invested in the public financial market. This by itself, already compares to Renaissancexe2x80x99s 110 billion, Bridgewaterxe2x80x99s 150 billion, and Berkshirexe2x80x99s ~200 billion.And a simple ratio of the Fair Value / Book Value indicates the total return of that part alone, is > 300% over the years. Given most investments by dollar amounts happens after 2014, a rough guess is a somewhat annualized return between 20-30%.But itxe2x80x99s much more than that. By collecting public reports, letxe2x80x99s take a closer look on Tencentxe2x80x99s biggest public holdings:^since IPO, less than 12 month agoThese top public holdings add up to 187 billion USD as at 19-Jan-2021.Letxe2x80x99s then take a bit of xe2x80x9cwildxe2x80x9d estimate, applying a 85/15 rule => assuming these positions accounts for 85% of Tencentxe2x80x99s entire public investment book => we then have 220 billion USD of its total public investment at the moment.How significant is this?Albeit some recency bias, from 30-Jun-2020 to 19-Jan-2021, Tencentxe2x80x99s public market investments alone (not including any private investment) has seen its market value increased by 108 billion, or 61% of Tencentxe2x80x99s total market cap appreciation over the same period. This should convince you that buying Tencent primarily for its gaming and social growth is wrong.Tencent, different to most social media or gaming companies, is running a very aggressive investment book, which has been growing and will continue to grow very aggressively. That investment bookxe2x80x99s performance will be making a bigger impact to its overall operation and share price movement. Please note we have not remarked any of its private investment book value, out of which we will see multiple unicorns going public soon.Counting its 10 most reported private holdings only, Tencentxe2x80x99s stake already sums up to 30 billion USD vs. 36 billion USD book value it recorded at purchase cost.Does this make Tencent a good investment ?Letxe2x80x99s take a quick look at its core business. Assuming Tencentxe2x80x99s private investment is still worth its original book value, the ex-Investment Market Cap is currently ~533 billion USD.Based on consensus operating revenues and incomes, we can see its core business is probably valued at 8x P/S ratio or 23x P/E ratioIt suffices to say this is quite reasonable (ok, attractive)  in this inflated market. Mind you this company still has >25% YoY revenue growth, >25% Net Income Margin, and a very very under-monetised Wechat ecosystem.In another words, if youxe2x80x99re willing pay for 11x P/S or 34x P/E for its core business, you get a 250 billion USD investment portfolio, for free.Its public investment book, while being impressive, should raise some concerns given the concentration of Asia market and extra volatility it brings to the stock price. But it is where they can utilise their data and knowledge advantages most at an early stage of becoming an investment firm, and itxe2x80x99s a good diversification to core DM equities.As they expand to the global market, I believe the investing flywheel will help them keep making good calls. After all, judging by its track record, itxe2x80x99s simply too good to ignore. Their top public holdings made an average 293% return over the last 12 months, and best performers spread over sectors like: Electric Vehicle, FinTech, Social e-Commerce, new content creators, digital Real Estate, SaaS. Through the invested companies, they also have exposure to Battery tech, 5G, Robotics, ...etc. It should convince you the odds to continue to find these diversified disruptive names are still on their side, evidenced by that: behind Media, Gaming & e-Commerce, the following 6 industries that Tencent invested most are: Finance, Transportation, SaaS, Education, Healthcare & Smart hardwares.Out of the biggest 500 private unicorns in the world, Tencent holds 1/10 of those, more than most venture capitals. We believe the data and knowledge mismatching between Tencentxe2x80x99s investment team and most investors is huge. It is a great way for investors to get a managed active exposure to both public and private great companies.Another upside here is therexe2x80x99 no key man risk, compared to most hedge funds. This is pretty much a proprietary investment playbook built on data and technology knowledge base, that could pass onto new analysts and managers, though it is a bit sad that machines are playing a much bigger role than humans even in discretionary style of investing.Trade Suggestion:For investors who want an active exposure to Asian technology, we believe investing in Tencent is better than most thematic ETFs you can find. Investing in Tencent has the benefit of the combination: one of the best cash machines in the world + best investment manager deploy that cash. It is somewhat still misunderstood - the willingness of the Company wanting to become an investment firm gives us a chance to let the new Berkshire Hathaway manage the money for you.We simply suggest a core position of long Tencent.

It has close to 170 million retail investors in its local share market. Adding people investing in managed funds, the number can be > 700 million.China has a long and broad culture of loving money + loving gambling. We also start to see a formation of a strong trend in venture investing in recent years.More and more young people want to escape from 996,  and work towards FIRE (financial independent, retire early). Trading/investing is seen as a mainstream way to achieve that.For demographic reasons, China will see a long term transition from real-estate centric investment to financial-assets centri investment.Talking about and investing in stocks, especially relatable names/companies is becoming inevitably popular in younger generations.Social networks on financial topics are uniqueInfluencers and communities on financial topics have their own charm - if someone successfully leads you to a better financial outcome (small or big), it will create a sense of intimacy & gratitude, and the feeling of necessity to follow to learn new stuff. Thatxe2x80x99s why FintTwit and Fin-Youtube always lead to viral spread and stickiness of fan base.  Being xe2x80x9cclose to the moneyxe2x80x9d also leads Fin-Youtube videos has highest CPM among other types. Showing off financial success has always been the tier 1 demand of social platforms. It is an ultimate show off of status + knowledge/skill + wealth.$TUTU, with its foundersxe2x80x99 social network nature, has successfully built an unique community with many grassroots and verified financial celebrities, allowing users to easily share their investment returns, combined with an easy UI to trade various products globally.But $TUTU can and will become much larger than Chinese RobinhoodChinese companies have a tendency to build out much more broadly and much deeper vertically, in contrast many US companies choose to focus in their niche area.I believe $TUTUxe2x80x99s potential is enormous, as capable of reaching below different segments (each of them has a huge TAM), not just a trading app:Financial segment:$TUTU currently has ~10 million users. It has a lot of room to reach out the 170mm retail investors, by broadening its offer to trade more products.China has 600 million managed fund retail investors. $TUTU has the potential to become a huge fund distribution platform for new generations.(itxe2x80x99s already part of the offer but quite small = room to grow) Chinese domestic private banking industry has a total market between 15 ~20 trillion yuan. The increasing recognition of using private banking has been steady, especially with older generations passing their wealth to younger ones, I believe $TUTU is a very good position to tap that huge market, to become a new generation digital private wealth firm.Chinaxe2x80x99s aging population + single child policy impact = many young families, when their parents pass away, would end up owning multiple properties but much less demands. This demographic structure will cause a long term transition from real-estate centric investment to financial-assets centri investment, which is a huge tail wind for $TUTU.$TUTU, in its financial planning offer, could also offer insurance, taxation (even lending) cross selling.The non-trading sectors are where I think $FUTU will be generating more of future revenue, a retail fund distributor and wealth manager directly connected to WeChat Pay, with tons of value-added service available. This is the future financial planning for digital natives.Social Segment:$TUTU, around its financial influencers, can partner with streaming platforms such as $BILI or Bytedance, reach out to a much broader audience, earning from streaming advertising.$TUTU, with a more complete product offer, could be directly connected with Wechat Pay. Tencent could use this finance-centric strategy to challenge Ali-Payxe2x80x99s payment-centric strategy, for bigger market share of e-wallets.$TUTUxe2x80x99s own online community could generate advertising and/or membership revenues as well, similar to Snowball or Zhihu.Information Segment & other Geos:$TUTU could become a major investment research distribution platform.$TUTU could become an online course platform on financial related topics.$TUTU could leverage its user data for more toB business.I believe $TUTU has a great chance to expand most of these services to South East Asia ($SE has 100 million users), and broadly oversea Chinese population.

I believe the deep connection with Tencent could really accelerate $TUTUxe2x80x99s path to be a giant fintech platform where younger generations socialize and manage their wealth.For cautious/exotic readers, you can sell the current very expensive put options of $FUTU to collect some decent premium waiting for pullbacks.According, we are adjusting our model portfolioxe2x80x99s holding based on this idea.

I'm a fan of this particular interview on how to separate different matters and to build a nuanced view on Tesla.To have a intellectually honest discuss about Tesla, one needs to openly look at below xe2x80x9cconflictsxe2x80x9d:Tesla's pursuit clean and solar energy solutions is good virtuevs.Traditional energy companies also have been putting tremendous amounts of capital and effort in the same sector.Elon has done a good job in promoting himself as an engineer & scientist and such ideology has been attracting brilliant engineers and encouraging younger generations vs.It is also true nothing fundamentally new has been done in science breakthroughs by Tesla, nor does Elon Musk have said/created anything super intelligent from a scientific point of view.Elon like Steve Jobs has been extremely smart in his unique, smart and very cost-efficient way marketing and promoting himself and his companiesvs.Sometimes such promotion is on the edge of crossing the lines of share price manipulation, dishonesty in promising unfeasible technology which has caused very unfortunate accidents.Tesla is doing well for humanity by setting vision and ambitions about achieving a better future vs. Taking advantage of the combination of: [ receiving government incentives + creative accounting + overpromising highly risky projects + funding through public often retail investors money ] (vs. Bezos also been doing rockets projects but out of his own pocket)Not for the purpose of any Tesla trade idea, i believe any rationale or sensible bitcoin discussion should similarly admit and address below conflicts:Amount of talents it attracted vs. Amount of gross behaviours for pure get-rich-quick purpose; The potential it does become a major alternative commodity assets (therefore the upside) vs. its volatile and speculative nature;The enormous enlightenment vs.Very little utility being a technology itself & purely relying on the store of value narrative it changed to a few years ago; This could possibly hurt its network effect in the future, which then challenges the entire limited supply consensus.It is a much better version of gold for certain EM people where extremely irresponsible money system exists vs.Most DM people buying it through passport-verified exchange account & the desire for mass institutional acceptance couldnxe2x80x99t be more opposite to the original decentralisation pursuit.Back to Tesla, ironically, having open minded intellectual honesty would easily make one observe and conclude that, most people don't have it ! It is very much true in most cases that the debate about $TSLA is absolutely a religious fight. Tesla fans almost blindly think the company will take over the world and in Elon we believe, no matter what. This makes most fundamental discussion about Tesla valuation on social platforms a waste of time. Even when we do look at fundamental analysis about Tesla, many bullish cases are more like imaginations rather than educated predictions, meaning the financial valuation is mixed with some most aggressive assumption of perfect execution, and simply ignoring the competitiveness of the market and the competence of other talents from other great companies. (subscribe to make sure you donxe2x80x99t miss when we talk about who could the most surprising disruptors to $TSLA; not one company, but a handful of them combined)Bear that in mind, let's now take a look at the option structure of $TSLA over time.Back in 2019 before the share price took off, $TSLA call option implied vol had been trading consistently lower than its put option implied vol, indicating that the market has more concerns about downside risk than upside. The difference between call & put option implied vols has converged into 2020 and stays that way, regardless the absolute level of the implied vol, meaning the market now thinks one should pay just as much to speculate the upside as protecting the downside. This, combined with the religious psychology from $TSLA supporters + its valuation, creates some interesting ideas for both tesla haves and have-nots.For tesla have-nots, it appears one can take the advantage of the disconnection between the still expensive put option of TSLA vs. the religious hodl psychology of $TSLA supporters. We believe any sell-off >15% would be seen as a rare and decent buy-the-dip opportunity for $TSLA bulls and quickly reverts back. The current sentiment especially the willingness to hold this stock for a longer term seems very strong. This makes selling $TSLA puts a compelling strategy to 1) collect low risk premium 2) opportunistically buy-the-dip.As at the publishing date 07-Jan-2021, the $TSLA 02-19-21 P600 closed at $16.40, with $TSLA share price $755. We suggest selling this or similar put options. This means for every option, you get paid $1640 to wait till 19-Feb-21, and potentially buy 100 shares of $TSLA if it falls down to $600 or below, which is a ~ 20% sell-off in a little over a month.For more aggressive readers, you can increase the strike level for more income. For example, selling  $TSLA 02-19-21 P650 will increase the income over the same period to $2800, and you get to buy 100 shares of $TSLA at $650 if striked in, which is a ~14% fall.Choose one of below:^Notional size = 100*# of options*strike levelObviously the risk is if $TSLA falling below your strike level, your loss would be equivalent to holding 100 shares per option, minus the premium. This trade also applies to $TSLA holders who want to opportunistically buy more shares in any correction, while getting paid to be patient. Due to its high risk nature, we only suggest using Feb-2020 puts.For $TSLA haves who start to have cautious views on its valuation and short term volatility, we believe covered call is also a great strategy. That is, for every 100 shares of $TSLA, you can sell an OTM call to boost your income if you believe $TSLA has limited room to go up by the option expiry date. So similarly for example, $TSLA 02-19-21 C1000 trades at $1685. Your profit will be capped at $1000, which is a 32% increase in a little over one month; however otherwise you get to collect a full premium of $1685, increase your return by 2.2% in less than 2 months.Rolling covered call strategy can be very profitable under some market conditions, as a great to way to boost your income, especially when you expect the parabolic move cannot repeat.

It has also been a year that almost 1/3 of youtube videos on my timeline have been talking about ARK top holdings and analyzing their daily transactions.For average retail investor, the optimism bias has likely reached all time high. Such optimism bias usually develops over three levels:overestimate of positive things (more stimulus bill, better-than-expected earnings, believe 10% daily return can repeat) and under-estimate of negative events (slower growth, bad earnings, believe all sell-offs is temporary and will bounce back )generate positive expectations again and againoptimism about self but pessimistic about others. (think yourself would be the one of the very few who can sell at top or before the next crisis.)How do we not let such optimism bias overtake our rationality and what kind of portfolio protection should we be seeking at this stage.The key is trying to understand the fundamental driver of the current round of asset price appreciation via first-principles thinking and reverse-engineering what might cause the next meltdown, even though most of our investing/trading failure is the failure to imagine the next crisis.QE and ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) is the elephant in the room. Yet I think most people have massively underestimated how well the \"long government bond\" strategy has performed historically.Since Nov-1999 to Nov-2020, over the 21-year period containing 3 major market crashes, US ten year government bonds has generated an annualized total return of 5.8%, compared to 6.7% from S&P 500 total return (including dividends) ; the <1% underperformance is more than well compensated by the materially lower volatility (annualized 6.4% for 10yr Bond vs. 15.2% for S&P500).This two-decade bull run of the Government bonds is not only just as strong as the equity market (even better adjusted for volatility); it amazingly provides an inherently negatively correlated capital protection to most temporary equity weakness.Over the same 21-year period, there've been 52 months where S&P500 had lost more than 2%; US government bonds had generated a positive number over 40 months out of those 52 months, thanks to flight-to-quality & flight-to-liquidity investor reactions.This arguably is the best supporting player you can ask for your portfolio: giving you green numbers when everything else is red; yet returning you just as much over the long term. It almost sounds too good to be true; It's like getting paid to have insurance. Continuously buying equity puts to provide similar protection would cost a fortune over the long run.Such xe2x80x9cself-yieldingxe2x80x9d insurance policy lays the foundation for traditional 60-40 or risk-parity portfolio construction. And that foundation started to disappear as the yields started to disappear. Two reasons:coupons are still a major component for the total return of holding government bonds; again over the same 21 years, even with unrepeatable price appreciation (yield decreasing) from the US Government bonds, coupons have contributed 57% or 3.3% out of the 5.8% total return per year.such low yields means there're (very) limited room left for the yields to compress further from this point = there's limited room for \"long-bond\" to provide capital appreciation into next equity weakness.Ironically most institutional investors never trimmed back their risk taking when their insurance from longing bonds became less effective. This might seem absurd but is totally logical if you think from first-principles:less yields usually = less expected return from the Bond location. That means if your portfolio target return hasn't changed (e.g. 9% per year) you need to source that return from your equity or other risky allocations. Investors might choose defensive equity names for this particular bucket, it is however still equity risk and will increase the overall beta of the portfolio.Some investors view coupons as an income is less important for holding bonds. Given bond yield can go negative, it is possible that a 10-year-US-treasury's Yield to Maturity (YTM) can move from +0.95% to -0.50%, and generate well over 10% capital gain via the bond price going up. (the sensitivity between YTM and the price change is measured by duration and convexity). It is not the most probable scenario, but simply having such possibility could mean investors are not afraid of taking the same risks.opportunity cost is much less; this just encourages more risk taking and it has a domino effect: the government bond guys got squeezed by FED and chase more yields into corporate bonds; the corporate bond guys got squeezed out and chase more yields into junk bonds ... the value equity guys chase growth, the growth guys chase small cap growth, the small cap growth chases small cap biotech...and so on so forth.most importantly, valuation (at least in theory).The basic of stock valuation is discounting future cash flows.For a construction company, one supposedly discounts the expected revenues for its signed contracts over the next 3 years; But how do you discount Netflix's future revenues; how do you discount basically the entire Nasdaq 100 index when everyone is turning into monthly subscription model.A high quality growth business usually has the stickiness and continuity of its monthly recurring revenue. It smooths out the lumpy upfront cash flow over a much longer time horizon, meaning investors need to look further when deriving all the future income, and start to take into account not only the 12 month cash rate, but 5-year, 10-year and/or 20-year treasury yields.This simply makes investing in $MSFT $AMZN and most SaaS companies, to some extent, an amplified long duration trade; meaning the price of these equities would behave in a similar way to the price of a long term treasury bond in reaction to long term interest rate, holding all else unchanged/equal. Take an actual US 30 year bond T 2.5% Aug-2049 (it pays 2.5% coupon a year till Aug-49) as an example,  when its yield (an indicator of the discount rate of the cash flow 30 years from now) dropped from 2.3% to 1% earlier 2020, the bond price increased over 30% from $97 to $131. Equities as a matter of fact can/should be viewed as a long term bond where its earnings acts like bond coupons. GMO has a nice article about this and they call it \"The Duration Connection\".FED can lower the overnight interest rate and set expectations for short term rates, the long term rates however is almost definitely a function of market expectation and an outcome of market activities. A sharp flattening of the yield curve (especially the long end) could beautifully help the valuation of companies (espeically ones with long recurring cash flow), and quite the opposite should the steepening happens.And the steepening is happening, quietly and alarmingly. The US long term treasury yield (below chart using 10-year-yield as an example) has been steadily increasing since the bottom in March-2020, mainly due to the expectation of higher inflations, while the 12 month cash rate stays down.Though technology and globalization are inherently deflationary, [compressed industrial activities + weaker USD + monetary & fiscal stimulus + strong US housing market] combined has increased the likelihood for inflation to shoot up even when people have less means to spend money.Regardless of whether you think actual inflation would hit and sustain at a materially higher level (which could be a topic for another 5 newsletters), market expectations are definitely rising as evidenced by raising long term treasury yields (or curious readers can research on real rates). And as we know, long term interest rate rising could probably hurt your growth stock valuation. Itxe2x80x99s precautionary to look at some protection trades.Summary:$TLT: outright short; low cost hedge on higher inflation;$TLT: use OTM call spread to fund OTM put spread; 8x max payoff in 6 months.Dont miss < $LQD option trades > subscribe to make sure you see a nuanced trade idea using similar logic, with extra protection on US corperate bonds.Subscribe nowTrade idea details:$TLT: outright short; low cost hedge on higher inflation;We simply think an outright short on US treasury bonds isn't too bad of a trade itself, given how low the yield, therefore the carry cost is.$TLT (iShares 20+ year bond ETF) is one of most active traded US Treasury ETFs. Its core holdings are long term treasuries with 20 years or more to maturity. With a net indicated yield of 1.25% (approx. for annual carry cost for shorting a bond), shorting this ETF makes it more of pure (cheap*) bet on the bond price move. And Shorting it means we are betting on higher longer term interest rates or closely correlated, higher inflation expectations. US 20 year treasury yield has already increased from 1% to 1.44% since Aug-2020 to Dec-2020. Another 0.5% ~ 0.8% increase over the next 6 months is not a difficult scenario with vaccines rolling out and activities recovering. A 0.5% increase in yield with $TLT 14.5 years effective duration (the sensitivity of bondxe2x80x99s price to bondxe2x80x99s yield) suggests the short selling would make a 7% ~ 12% return if that happens.^ close price when published, as at 03-Jan-2021 *always check with your broker for borrow cost and other fees that might be associated with short selling.$TLT: use OTM call spread to fund OTM put spread; 8x max payoffFor more experienced readers, $TLT also has good option market liquidity. Below are some of the option structures we think might generate nicer payoff with limited downside.First we look for options expiring 18-June-2021 to allow some time for inflation expectation to play out further. Given the relatively flat volatility curve of $TLT, we are not paying proportionally much higher for longer options. The leg we are potentially making profits are the put spreads with strikes [148 & 135]; that is we buy put option TLT US 06/18/21 P148 Equity and sell put option TLT US 06/18/21 P135 Equity. This means if $TLT price decreases from the current level of 157 to 148, we start to make money and our profit run will stop out if the price falls below 135. Price levels 148 & 135 are equivalent to 6.7% fall and 14.4% fall from 157; which also roughly translate into 0.43% & 0.99% increment in the 20 year treasury yield. As noted above, US 20 year treasury yield has already increased from 1% to 1.44% since Aug-2020 to Dec-2020. Another 0.43% ~ 0.99% move over the next 6 months is quite likely with vaccines rolling out and activities recovering. We choose to sell 135 put to reduce some cost; and to be realistic: considering another 1% increase in yield, the 20 year treasury bonds could begin to look attractive to long again as a safety heaven trade, with its capital gain room increasing dramatically.We sell the call spreads to further reduce the cost. We think given the US double deficit, inflation expectations and current momentum, it is very hard for treasury bond prices to increase sharply. Strike levels 175 and 185 are 12.8% and 17.3% out of money, and roughly translate to 0.9% and 1.2% decrease in US 20 year rates. If happens, that would basically take the entire US yield curve flat to zero (or negative in the front to belly part ). We think they are low risk funding options for our trades.Overall our option basket has a net premium cost of $1.63. (US option market has a multiple of 100, meaning one option has 100 underlying shares). This means the minimal dollar cost of this strategy is $1.63 x 100 = $163, which requires buy or sell 1 of each option we suggested in the table below.  The max payoff is when $TLT price drops by 14.4% or more at expiry, where the $163 cost will turn into $1300 payoff (~8x); or $1137 profit, (~7x).The max risk is when $TLT price increases by 12.85% or more at expiry, where investors will incur a total loss of $863, (~5.2x).We suggest readers use less than 1~2% of their portfolio on the premium cost, given the highly speculative nature of this trade. Experienced readers can change strikes, expiry dates, modifying legs or increase budget of this trade to aim for more profits.Above chart shows onexe2x80x99s expected payoff at optionsxe2x80x99 expiry date, vs. the $TLT share price change from current level (~$157.7).Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Hope isnxe2x80x99t good enough when the stakes are this high.The only way to ensure that future AIs have incentives that are aligned with the individuals that interact with them, is by building an incentive structure. One powerful enough to force the organisations that build AI to have no other choice but to align with individuals.How can you force Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Snap and TikTok to all swing their priorities away from serving advertisers to serving individuals?You lower switching costs, making platform-exit a real option for individuals and therefore making anti-user behaviour extremely costly.We need to give individuals the power to enforce accountability on companies and AI systems that are not aligned with individuals.Other than accountability through democracy, it seems like there arenxe2x80x99t many ways individuals can exercise power against the tech giants.The way to give individuals that power is to build tools that help them to easily understand and control what data about them AIs/companies can access. Given that AIs need data to know us well & perform successfully, if individuals only give data where they benefit and can revoke access en-masse when they donxe2x80x99t, then AIs have to be aligned with users or they wonxe2x80x99t be able to compete.The ability for individuals to withdraw their data en-masse would be a powerful accountability mechanism & incentive to do whatxe2x80x99s best for individuals. If we can build that future where individuals have fluid, granular control of the data companies collect about them & that AIs use, wexe2x80x99re 90% of the way to achieving AI-individual alignment, because we have created the right incentive-system.But how could individuals control what AIs know about them? Most people donxe2x80x99t even know what companies like Facebook, and Google know about them. Just understanding what companies and their AI systems know about you is hard. Data isnxe2x80x99t easy to understand & companies donxe2x80x99t *want* to tell you.But before you truly control *anything* you need to understand it. You need to know:what data exists about youwho has itwhat does it meanwhat do they use it forThen, once you understand it, you can:reclaim data to keep for yourselfdecide who gets to access itdecide what they can use it fordelete it from anywhere you wantThatxe2x80x99s a start, and would force these companies to perk up in their respect for individuals as humans, not just as xe2x80x9cusersxe2x80x9d.But even then you still donxe2x80x99t have true autonomy over your data. Youxe2x80x99re fighting with companies over what *they* do with it. Therexe2x80x99s a fundamental constraint on the possibilities of what your data could be used for, which is the incentives of the companies that hold it.If there was a company that didnxe2x80x99t have outside incentives for they use your data, that only served you, then your incentives would be aligned. Imagine if your data was no longer constrained by the imagination and incentives of ad platforms like Facebook and Google. What happens when the primary purpose of your data existing isnxe2x80x99t to make money selling you ads? What happens when data is broken out of corporate silos where it sits providing only a partial picture of who you are? to represent the full you? Itxe2x80x99s hard to grasp the magnitude of this shift except by analogy. When computing was only for businesses, the question was asked: but how would this be useful to consumers? A personal computer is pointless, nothing to use it for. The software hadnxe2x80x99t been built to make them useful, because there were no personal computers or users to build it for. xf0x9fx90x94 & xf0x9fxa5x9aRight now businesses use personal data for their own ends. There are no consumer use-cases other than ad-driven feeds, beyond a hobbyist fringe tinkering with quantified self. For students of technology/Apple history: a hobbyist fringe tinkering with a tool that businesses find extremely valuable & powerful. Sound familiar?With new and powerful tools, businesses come first. They have the willingness to pay & the urgent need. But: consumer companies grow bigger.Computing: IBM (1911) < Apple (1976)Social Networking: LinkedIn (2002) < Facebook (2004)Data infrastructure: Segment (2011) < ???When personal data gets centred around the user, and users are empowered to choose what it gets used for, the use-cases will explode. Data will become a tool for thought, introspection, self-improvement, health, finding friends and partners, and for building personalised AI. Data will make us superhuman.There is a huge amount of responsibility placed on the company entrusted with the userxe2x80x99s data. Sufficiently good and complete data will give that company the power to manipulate users even more than Facebook and Google can do now. Do you really want that power to be held by companies selling ads?Trust becomes the key differentiator in this world. Individuals need to trust that the company behind the AI puts their goals first. That the company wins when they win.The real question here is: if you *can* control what AIs/companies know about you, will you let any AI access all your data? An AI system with all your data thatxe2x80x99s aligned perfectly with you sounds incredibly useful. But who could you trust to make one? Itxe2x80x99s difficult to pick a company - only Apple is making a case for themselves. Really you could only trust a company that has no external incentives. A company built entirely around you.If they are funded by advertisers targeting you with ads - NOPE!If they havenxe2x80x99t been transparent with how they use your data - NOPE!i.e. ultimately this is no company we currently associate with AI today.This company would need to be built from the ground up to be focused around serving the human user. Its revenue would need to come directly from users themselves - giving it no outside incentives. It would need to be the most transparent and trusted company in the world. It would give users true control. By being the most user-focused ethical, trusted company, it would have an unassailable comparative advantage over companies with baggage.The company would need to stake its reputation on its pro-user behaviour.No platitudes, instead: extreme commitment. Not xe2x80x9cDonxe2x80x99t be evilxe2x80x9d, but xe2x80x9cBe Goodxe2x80x9d. Prioritising individualsxe2x80x99 autonomy, joy, and self-actualisation above profit. By being so pro-user, ironically it could become the most valuable company in the world.You might have guessed, but thatxe2x80x99s the company wexe2x80x99re building at @GetEthi. We're helping individuals to understand and control their data, and we'll shortly be releasing our first \"use-case\" for people's data.It's definitely a bit ridiculous to claim we might one-day be the most trusted company in the world, and that we have a chance in hell of building the best AI, but Sam Altman always points out that it is nearly always better to take the more ambitious path. So thatxe2x80x99s the plan.Wexe2x80x99ve called our company Ethi for a reason. Here are our extreme commitments:Ethi is short for ethical, and we want to be held to that standard.We will make no revenue that isnxe2x80x99t from our users.Your data will only be used in ways you clearly consent to, that benefit you.Our motto is xe2x80x9cBe Goodxe2x80x9d.Wexe2x80x99ll be competing with the most valuable companies in the world. The most powerful companies in the world. Our existence is a direct critique of how Facebook, Google, etc. have done business. They canxe2x80x99t even copy us because theyxe2x80x99re too locked into their ad-driven business model. This is whatxe2x80x99s called xe2x80x9ccounter-positioningxe2x80x9d.Personally, Ixe2x80x99m so excited to be building this company. Putting individuals in control of their data is my lifexe2x80x99s mission. Itxe2x80x99s the best work I could possible be doing. If Ethi succeeds in our grandest mission, it will ensure that individuals remain autonomous in a world where AIs grow more powerful and exponentially increasing amounts of data get collected about us.

As more people choose to not use Facebook, employees leave the company, and users choose to delete data from Facebook, they will lose their data advantage, and soon their talent advantage.In the next decade, it will become painfully obvious that we should pay for any software that learns about us as individuals. If we donxe2x80x99t, that software will use knowledge about us to achieve the goals of the organisation that made it, rather than our goals.Nobody believes that Facebook is on their side. This is a structural consequence of their business model, where they sell our attention and xe2x80x9cthe gradual, slight, imperceptible change in our own behaviour and perceptionxe2x80x9d [Jaron Lanier]. Facebook serves their advertisers, not you, because thatxe2x80x99s where they get their money from.This means that there is an incentive misalignment between you, a single human individual, and Facebook. On the other side of your phonexe2x80x99s glowing screen, Facebookxe2x80x99s incentives have been encoded into a powerful AI system built and optimised by thousands of the worldxe2x80x99s smartest software engineers.Maximising Facebookxe2x80x99s profits means addicting us to feeds of junk-food information, and maximally surveilling every individual they can. They need to maximise daily time spent on platform, and to target you with the ads that youxe2x80x99re most likely to click. Unsurprisingly, this has lead to 85% of US adults thinking that social media companies know too much about them.We interact with AI systems that have their goals set by the companies that build them. We, as humans, try to use those systems to fulfil our needs and goals, while those systems try to use us to fulfil theirs. We interact with these semi-intelligent agents through our phones for hours every day. They control large portions of the information we see, and have different goals from us. This is nuts. It is making peoplexe2x80x99s lives worse every day, whether itxe2x80x99s their mental health, political polarisation, or productivity. This is not the good future.We need to be building AIs that are aligned with the interests of their users. I call this xe2x80x9cAI-Individual alignmentxe2x80x9d.AI alignment is about making sure AIs we build are good for humanity. But this alignment canxe2x80x99t just be between AI and humanity as a whole. Humanity too vague, there are just so many questions for which I donxe2x80x99t know if we have answers:Who gets to decide what humanity as a wholexe2x80x99s interests are?Who will build the AI which is aligned with humanity?How are the incentives of that organisation aligned with humanity?Are my interests in lock-step with humanityxe2x80x99s?Should there even be a centralised notion of humanityxe2x80x99s interests?AI-alignment is a great thing to work on, but it canxe2x80x99t just be at the scale of the entire human race. A better approach, which also has more actionable next steps, is to aim for alignment between an AI and the individual humans that interact with it.To nail down why this is, letxe2x80x99s look at two organisations building AI systems today.Consider AI built by Facebook or the NSA, perfectly aligned with those organisations. Would it be aligned with normal users/citizens? Certainly not. Facebookxe2x80x99s AI would be trying to profit maximise for Facebook, while the NSAxe2x80x99s would compromise individual freedoms in order to keep xe2x80x9cthe countryxe2x80x9d safe.The NSAxe2x80x99s goals lead to 1984xe2x80x99s big brother. Facebookxe2x80x99s AI algorithms optimise for Engagement (time you spend scrolling), Growth (new users), and Monetisation (showing you more ads, having you click them). These are not your goals. Because Facebook as a company are wedded to the ad-driven business model, their incentives cannot be aligned with yours. They canxe2x80x99t build products with AI-Individual alignment.AIs can only get to know us through data about us. The amount of data they collect about us, our friends, and our socio-economic demographics makes it trivial for them to target us so well that it feels like our phones are listening to us. Nobody wants to give Facebook more data, in fact people want to delete their data from Facebook, or even delete their entire account.Facebookxe2x80x99s lack of alignment with individuals will slowly weaken their ability to win the AI war. As more people choose to not use Facebook, employees leave the company, and users choose to delete data from Facebook, they will lose their data advantage, and soon their talent advantage.Users move from the old and unfashionable ad-driven platforms to the new and delightful platforms. That means from Facebook to Instagram to Tiktok. In time, these new platforms also compromise on user experience and trust to serve their advertisers, and are in turn superseded by newer, more fashionable ones. Users will always fall out of love with companies who donxe2x80x99t first and foremost serve them.What are our options here? How can we ensure AI-individual alignment?Hope AI is developed by a benevolent organisation that aligns its interests with individuals & humanityForce AI organisations to align with individualsHope?? Option 1 doesnxe2x80x99t cut it - hoping alone doth no future build. We need to create incentives that force AI organisations to align with individuals if they want to survive.

Doctors have an incentive to prescribe certain drugs even though they know that another drug may be more effective or has fewer side effects. Lawyers have an incentive to drag a lawsuit out for longer even though they know it could potentially be resolved. Financial advisers have an incentive to recommend some products even though these products may be riskier than others. This is not evil capitalism in action. It is simply impossible to create incentive systems that are always fair and never create conflicts of interest. And the people who work in these businesses are not evil or deceptive. The vast majority are ethical and honestly believe they give the best advice they can.So, what happens when advisers give advice that may not be in the clientxe2x80x99s best interest? According to a new study Uri Gneezy and his colleagues, many advisers have to deceive themselves before they can deceive their clients. In other words, they have to make themselves honestly believe that the course of action they recommend is indeed the best advice possible.To show how this self-deception works they did a series of experiments where financial advisers were asked to look at two products A and B with different risk and return characteristics. In the initial setup, product A was less risky than product B but also had lower expected returns (think a bund fund vs. an equity fund). Then, people were randomly selected into three situations. In the control group, the advisers had to simply evaluate which one of investments A and B would be more suitable for their client and then recommend it to a client. They were also asked which of the two investments they would choose for themselves. In the xe2x80x9cbeforexe2x80x9d treatment, the advisers were informed that they get an extra incentive in the form of a bonus if they recommend investment A to the client but no bonus if they recommend investment B. Then they were again asked to evaluate which investment they thought was more suitable for their client, recommend an investment, and then decide which investment they would choose for themselves. Finally, in the xe2x80x9cafterxe2x80x9d treatment, the advisers were told about the incentive to recommend investment A only after they had assessed if A or B were more suitable for the client. The chart below shows how many advisers chose investment A in each situation.Advisers choosing the lower risk investment ASource: Gneezy et al. (2020).If we look at the xe2x80x9cafterxe2x80x9d treatment, the cynical observer immediately notices how few advisers think that investment A is the best choice for the client, but once they are made aware of the incentive to recommend A, the number of advisers who do recommend A increases dramatically. Yet, when asked what they would prefer for themselves, very few would invest in A. Fair enough, but thatxe2x80x99s not how incentives work in real life. Instead, they work more like in the xe2x80x9cbeforexe2x80x9d case. There, the advisers know about the incentive to recommend investment A before they think about what is best for their client, and hence a larger number of advisers think that investment A is indeed better for them. They afterward go on and recommend investment A to their clients. But look at what happens when they are asked to invest in A or B? 60% of the advisers choose to invest in A, a much larger number than in the xe2x80x9cafterxe2x80x9d treatment. They really believe that investment A is the better investment and they would buy it for themselves.In successive experiments, the researchers increase the stakes and the interesting thing is that advisers would gladly buy an inferior investment for themselves and recommend them to their clients as long as they have some way to justify to themselves and their clients that investment A really is the better and more suitable investment. Only when it becomes absolutely impossible to deceive themselves do advisers give in and stop recommending the incentivised product. Few advisers are comfortable with lying to their clients. And that is a good thing.I have previously written about how advisers recommend to their clients what they invest in themselves xe2x80x93 often to the detriment of the clientxe2x80x99s performance. But in the light of this research, it appears to me that this is just a natural outcome of us being human and being able to look ourselves in the mirror. And before you think that advisers are anyway crooks who have learned to deceive themselves to keep up their self-image, ask yourself what incentives you have in your job that may be in conflict with your clientsxe2x80x99 best interests? How do you resolve these conflicts? I know that I have been guilty of self-deception in the past and I might be today. I am trying my best to live up to my fiduciary duty and give the best advice to my clients I can (which in my current job means recommending the best stocks possible and being transparent about the performance of my recommendations). But I have no way of knowing if I am deceiving myself. And if you read these lines and think to yourself you are not guilty of this, I would say there is a pretty good chance you are deceiving yourself into thinking that. Because we all are deceiving ourselves in one way or another.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Ethics vs. incentives - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/ethics-vs-incentives"}

Not much, really. I have compiled my research some years ago in a paper. In essence, I think gold is predominantly driven by inflation expectations and real rates (with real rates typically being the flip side of inflation expectations priced in bond markets). But this relationship is non-linear and gold reacts far more in situations of extremely negative real rates such as an acute crisis or an unexpected spike in inflation expectations. There is little to no evidence that gold acts as a hedge against Dollar exchange rate fluctuations or to equity market volatility.However, these are average observations, and Pedro Gomis-Porqueras, Shuping Shi, and David Tan have investigated gold as a crisis hedge with an interesting new approach. They looked at gold as a global asset class that should react to all kinds of crises, not just crises manifest in US assets. Then, they tried to split crisis periods from calm market periods with a new threshold approach. I wonxe2x80x99t bore you with the details, but instead, just show you the crisis periods they have identified:Crisis periods 1997 to 2019Source: Gomis-Porqueras et al. (2020).Just looking at the chart shows that gold prices tend to rise in times of crisis and that is what their study finds. In calm markets, there is no link between gold prices and equity markets or sovereign bond markets. But once a crisis hits and markets move fast, gold starts to become a good crisis hedge for shocks in equity markets, bond markets, and oil markets. Furthermore, the authors find that gold prices are always a good hedge against a stronger US Dollar, no matter the environment.But the gold sceptics out there will notice that all the crises identified in the chart above happened during the last supercycle for gold that started in 1999 and probably ended in 2013. If gold is anyway in a multi-year bull market, it shouldnxe2x80x99t be too surprising that gold hedges against extreme market declines in other asset classes.What makes the new study interesting is that with the advent of Covid-19 the authors could test their model and their results out of sample with a new crisis that hit outside a gold supercycle. And the good news is that in 2020, gold still acted as a crisis hedge. The results for 2020 were qualitatively the same as the results from 1997 to 2019. Thus, gold remains an attractive insurance against crises xe2x80x93 even in the 2020s. For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.It would really be interesting to see if Bitcoin could take over Gold's role. It wasn't really the case during the first Covid crisis but could investors opinion of Bitcoin have changed? Both gold (or Bitcoin) both work as insurance against crises because enough people believe they will.Interesting study. The authors should go back further in history to back-test goldxe2x80x99s role in pre- & post-gold standard periods.No posts","title":"Gold as a crisis hedge revisited - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/gold-as-a-crisis-hedge-revisited"}

And this is not happening in Europe where the adoption of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures are becoming mandatory for banks and insurers, this is happening in the United States. Most people know that in the United States there is a large group of people who do not believe that climate change is real or that it poses a significant threat to society. With the last administration, this climate change denial was going all the way to the White House. Yet, at the same time, the Pentagon calls climate change a xe2x80x9ccatastrophic national security threatxe2x80x9d and prepares its troops for a world severely impacted by climate change.And when it comes to their own money, banks across the United States prepare as well. A study by two researchers from the University of Texas showed that bank loans given to businesses all over the country differentiate between companies with different climate risks. Businesses that are more exposed to the impact of climate change like floods, droughts, and windstorms pay a premium of roughly 14bps per year on their bank loans compared to businesses that are less exposed to climate risks. Compared to the average interest for businesses with low climate risk that is about a 10% premium on the interest demanded by banks on loans to businesses exposed to climate risks. Banks do that because they know that climate change makes loans to businesses in certain areas riskier and no matter what your local politician or the bankxe2x80x99s lobbyist may say, these risks are real and they donxe2x80x99t want to lose money over it.If American banks can include climate risks in their business practices, then I would say every company around the world needs to get to terms with its exposure to climate change and the risks and opportunities that come with it. Not doing so, is kind of a dereliction of duty, in my view.

If done well, it can significantly increase our business success and enhance our career chances. Bradford Bitterly, Alison Brooks and Maurice Schweitzer have put humour in a business environment to the test and found that a funny and appropriate joke will enhance the perception of the person who tells the joke.For example, they gave volunteers the task to rate testimonials about Switzerland. The serious testimonial they evaluated was: xe2x80x9cThe country is beautiful. The scenery is truly breathtaking!xe2x80x9d Meanwhile, the humorous testimonial was: xe2x80x9cThe mountains are great for skiing and hiking, and the flag is a big plus.xe2x80x9d The chart below shows how the two people who delivered these testimonials are rated in terms of status.Status rating for testimonials about SwitzerlandSource: Bitterly et al. (2017).Note, that I am not showing how funny the respondents perceived the testimonials to be, but the status they inferred to the teller. If you are making a successful joke in business, you are not just lightening the mood, you are elevating your status in the eyes of others. In a series of experiments, the researchers showed that by telling jokes we are perceived as more powerful, but also more competent and confident and people are thus more likely to trust us. And trust is what drives sales in most businesses. I chose this example of a humorous testimonial about Switzerland because having lived there for 21 years, I can confirm that the Swiss rightfully have no international reputation for being funny (says the Germanxe2x80xa6). Instead, in a Swiss business setting it is predominantly about competence. Swiss businesses make brilliant products, and they think if the quality of the product is high, you donxe2x80x99t need to do anything else to sell it. However, the research above shows that you can appear more competent than you really are just by being funny. Or as my father-in-law says: xe2x80x9cIf you canxe2x80x99t dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bulls**t.xe2x80x9dSo, please, use more humour in business. It will help you sell more and come across as a nicer and more competent person. But be aware that humour can be a double-edged sword xe2x80x93 as I have found out by writing these missives whenever I make a joke that a reader doesnxe2x80x99t get or doesnxe2x80x99t find funny. I hereby apologise to all my readers for making unfunny jokes. I did not mean to upset you.And I know, these failed jokes reduce my status in your eyes and make me look less competent. Because that is what the research says it does. So, for all of you who like to try out more jokes in a business setting, make sure never to use unfunny jokes like dad jokes (see here for a sample). Also, a no-no are puns, unless you elevate them to an art form like this guy. And particularly bad and totally forbidden are rude jokes like these. I really mean it. Also, never ever use jokes like these. And please, never use any of these jokes. They could get you into prison.Better to try some harmless and self-deprecating jokes like these.

The chart below is from that research paper and shows the outperformance of analyst recommendations relative to the countriesxe2x80x99 individualism score for the developed countries only. Analysts in countries with lower individualism tend to make better recommendations.Analyst recommendations and country individualismSource: Hofstede, Azevedo and Muller (2020).Interestingly, another study was published recently as a working paper that looked at analysts based in the United States, covering US stocks but coming from different national backgrounds. This study showed that even those analysts working in the United States differ in their recommendations and forecasts. Analysts with a background from a more individualistic culture like the United States, the UK, Australia, or Canada tended to make more and bolder forecasts. They want to differentiate themselves and stick out of the herd by making grandiose forecasts based on their private information.Analysts from a cultural background that is more collectivistic in nature, on the other hand, tend to underweight their own insights and focus more on the prevailing consensus. These analysts tend to make more moderate forecasts. But as every seasoned investor knows, bold forecasts rarely come true. In fact, the more aggressive a forecast is, the more likely it is to fail. Good investors have learned to ignore the extreme bulls or bears in the market because they know they just add noise and no value.However, if an analyst who isnxe2x80x99t normally given to bold forecasts suddenly starts to make one, one should pay attention. And that is what seems to happen with analysts from different cultural backgrounds as well. Analysts from individualistic cultures make bolder forecasts and do so more often, but over time, market reactions to these forecasts are diminished. Meanwhile, if an analyst from a less individualistic culture makes a bold forecast, the market reacts more, and investors pay more attention. And the empirical evidence indicates that they are right to do so. If an analyst who isnxe2x80x99t known for flashy and bold forecasts starts to make some, that tends to be a real signal that adds a lot of value to investors.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Does their cultural background affect analyst forecasts? - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/does-the-cultural-background-affect"}

Traditionally, news media from the FT and the Wall Street Journal to the financial TV channels broke the news about companies and the economy to a broader audience. As social media platforms became more popular, the media buzz was mirrored in the social media platforms. However, with newsroom funding declining and social media platforms growing, more and more journalists are taking their cues on what to report from Twitter and Facebook. In other words, social media increasingly drives news media. The chart below shows the result of an investigation into buzz about financial markets. The blue line shows the size of the influence social media has on news media, while the red line shows the influence news media has on social media. The shift in leadership could not have been more pronounced.Drivers of media buzzSource: Gan et al. (2020). Note: Blue line shows the size of the influence of social media on news media, the red line the reverse.But has any investor worried about the impact this leadership by social media has on market integrity? Social media is much almost unregulated, and it is easy to spread rumours and fake news on it. If the audience of a Twitter or Facebook account is large enough, this fake news can spread like wildfire and lead to significant swings in share prices. In the past, a market manipulator had to pick up the phone, call a journalist and start a conversation with the famous line: xe2x80x9cWhat is it I hear about company A needing fresh capital?xe2x80x9d The journalist had then to be gullible enough to spread the rumour. But usually, journalists would wise up to such efforts and become a valuable filter to fake news and rumours. As the example of fake news in the political corners of Twitter and Facebook shows, there is no need for a journalist anymore. Instead, fake news can spread to a large number of gullible readers, and even if the news is debunked, the sources of fake news hardly ever lose influence.I wouldnxe2x80x99t be surprised if the next wave of market manipulation scandals will not originate based on insider trading or the like, but on price manipulation using fake news on social media.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Social media vs. news media - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/social-media-vs-news-media"}

And this almost monopolistic position apparently has some influence not only on fund flows but also on returns of different investment styles. Itzhak Ben-David and his colleagues have exploited a change in Morningstarxe2x80x99s rating system almost twenty years ago to show how big the influence of the rating agency really is.Until 2002, Morningstar rated all funds based on past performance, volatility, consistency of returns, etc. independent of the fundxe2x80x99s style. That meant that as one style started to outperform, the funds following this style started to get four- and five-star ratings, while funds following underperforming styles got worse ratings. In 2002, the company introduced its (in)famous style box and started to rate funds within their own style. I think the chart below does make it clear that this had a significant effect on the average ratings of funds with different styles.Morningstar ratings before and after the introduction of style boxesSource: Ben-David et al. (2020).Investors being lazy as they are, tend to follow Morningstar ratings and invest in the highest-rated funds in a given peer group. No matter what consultants and asset allocators claim about the sophistication of their process, in the end, it is past performance that counts because past performance also determines the rating of a fund within its style box. Following ratings or following complex selection processes are in practice all too often just a complicated way of investing in the funds with the best past performance.The left chart below shows that fund flows both before 2002 and after 2002 follow past performance. But with the introduction of the style box, Morningstar at least managed to reduce the amount of flows chasing past performance. And this apparently also influenced style returns. If investors put a lot of funds to work in funds that had strong performance in the past, they create a herding effect that perpetuates the price momentum of past winners. As a result, value stocks, small cap stocks and other styles tended to have longer-lasting trends in the past and outperformed for longer before mean reversion kicked in.After 2002, these flows were reduced and, as the right-hand chart below shows, performance became less persistent. In their study, the researchers show that this lack of fund flows has contributed to the lack of outperformance seen in small cap and value stocks over the last two decades. Does that mean that small cap stocks and value donxe2x80x99t outperform at all and it was all a mirage? No. The value effect and the small cap effect have been observed for much longer than mutual funds have been around. But it is clear from this study that the performance of different styles depends on how investors behave. And as their behaviour changes, so do the value premium or the small cap premium. I am not aware if anyone has done a proper analysis of changing investor behaviour and its impact on styles and factors (except the usual ones showing that after a style is described in the literature its return declines), but I think it pays for both value and small cap investors to think about what has changed in investor attitudes and the investment environment that has reduced the value and size premium. And once you come up with a couple of answers, ask yourself how persistent these changes are going to be.Fund flows following Morningstar ratings (left), creating style return persistence (right)Source: Ben-David et al.

Talking to both fund managers and executives of businesses on these upcoming ESG disclosure regulations, I encounter all kinds of reactions ranging from xe2x80x9cI donxe2x80x99t have time for this. It makes no sense and is just an additional burden.xe2x80x9d To xe2x80x9cGreat, letxe2x80x99s get ahead of the crowd and be transparent about our climate-related risks before everybody else does.xe2x80x9dAs an investor, I always prefer more transparency, but from the perspective of a fund manager or a company executive, does it really make a difference to be more transparent? In a word: yes.That is the conclusion from a new set of experiments by Satoshi Taguchi and Yoshio Kamijo who asked people to participate in a set of trust games. In these games, participants (investors) were asked to hand over a portion of their money to another person (the executive) who uses this money to invest in a project. The executive can get either a high return or a low return on this project. Once the return has been achieved, the executive can then decide how much money to give back to the investors (i.e. how high the dividend should be). The interesting thing is that the level of productivity and thus the return of the investment of the project is only known to the executive. Thus, the executive can either decide to not disclose the level of productivity of the project or voluntarily disclose the level of productivity of the project. Naturally, if the executive knows that the project doesnxe2x80x99t create high returns, she is likely to not disclose that information and if the executive knows that the project is going to be highly profitable, she is likely to voluntarily disclose that information to the investor.However, the researchers also used some modifications to create other states. First, they simulated a situation when the information about the productivity of the project would be unintentionally disclosed (i.e. through an information leak) or situations in which the executive could not choose to disclose or the information, good or bad, had to be disclosed to the investor. Finally, in a fifth setting, the investors could ask the executives for the information and the executives could then voluntarily disclose the information based on the demands of investors.The chart below shows how much money of their initial endowment of 10 units the investors chose to hand over to the executives.Money invested depending on disclosureSource: Taguchi and Kamijo (2020).Note how trust in the executive builds up, the more transparent the executive become, and the more information is disclosed to the investor. If the executive refuses to disclose vital information about the project, investments are low. If the executive cannot choose to disclose or not disclose the information investment gets a bit higher. It is a situation, where investors are willing to give executives some benefit of the doubt and thus invest a bit more. But note how investment increase once information about the project is disclosed. If the disclosure is unintentional (e.g. mandated by regulators) investments already jump compared to the situation where the information is not disclosed. But executives who voluntarily disclose the information receive an even bigger share of the portfolio of the investors. Finally, if the investors ask for information and executives then voluntarily provide it, investments are highest. What is going on here? In basic terms, deeper interactions between investors and executives build a deeper level of trust. By virtue of these interactions of asking for information and then receiving it, an additional layer of trust is built which drives higher investments. Unfortunately, most investors never dare to ask for vital information or donxe2x80x99t have access to executives or fund managers to ask for it. Thus, the best course of action for fund managers and executives is to voluntarily disclose information about their businesses and funds. The basic rule here is the more you disclose, the more your investors will trust you, and the more money they will invest. For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Transparency builds trust - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/transparency-builds-trust"}

But of course, being the eco-mentalist I am, I have to emphasise the enormous cost of Christmas to the environment. On top of everything, I am a grumpy German who doesnxe2x80x99t like to have fun, so let me try to ruin Christmas for you as much as I can.So, youxe2x80x99re probably looking forward to eating lots of turkey. You are dreaming of a table overflowing with all kinds of food, too much to eat for Napoleonxe2x80x99s Army on their way back from Russia should they happen to pass through your neighbourhood. How dare you!On average, a person in the UK prepares food on Christmas that causes the emission of 26kg of CO2. And we prepare way too much of it. The waste amounts to the shells of an estimated 240 million Brussels sprouts, and the peels of 105 million potatoes, 20 million parsnips and 30 million carrots. Simply preparing less food or going on a diet could save 7kg of CO2 emissions per person. Of course, if you are on a diet on Christmas, that is just going to make you miserable, so you can skip the turkey, goose, or whatever bird you are cooking for a vegetarian alternative. This way, you are not only saving another 3kg of CO2 per person but make sure that all your guests on the Christmas table will be miserable as well.With 66.6 million people in the UK, we could thus save 0.666 million tonnes of CO2 while making everyone as miserable as possible.Speaking of being miserable on Christmas, why donxe2x80x99t we all take a page out of the book of former US President Jimmy Carter? If we lower the room temperature in our houses throughout winter by 1 degree Celsius, we can save xc2xa342 a year in heating costs and 184kg of CO2 emissions per household. Want that cosy hygge feeling: Just wear a jumper or two that will keep you warm.On average, Brits spend c. xc2xa3430 per person on Christmas gifts. An estimated xc2xa3100 of these gifts are thoroughly unwanted or useless and will be thrown away afterward. These unwanted gifts create CO2 emissions of c. 4.8 million tonnes, or roughly 5% of a typical householdxe2x80x99s carbon footprint per year.And while we are on the topic of Christmas presents, wrapping paper causes an estimated 1.4 tonnes of CO2 emissions in the UK that can be eliminated by wrapping your presents in old newspapers or putting them into a jute sack that used to hold the potatoes you just cooked for your Christmas dinner (or the sack that used to hold coals if you live in a Charles Dickens novel).Even better, why donxe2x80x99t you instead buy gifts that donxe2x80x99t cause so many CO2 emissions? You can even buy your loved ones carbon offsets to offset their entire carbon footprint for a year. This way, they get that nice glow in their face that comes from looking at a useless piece of paper and having to thank you for it.Normally, I would go on here about the carbon footprint of travelling to see your loved ones over Christmas or worse, taking a trip to the sun. If there is one good thing about Christmas in a pandemic, itxe2x80x99s that this is all gone, so I am not going to tell you that travelling from London to Liverpool by car is creating 62kg of CO2 while using the train causes 15kg of CO2 emissions per person. I will also not tell you that flying from London to New York in economy creates about 1.8 tonnes of CO2 emissions or about 20% of the average personxe2x80x99s annual carbon footprint. And if you fly business class, that carbon footprint increases by a factor of four to five.  The big one. Of course, being environmentally conscious you only go for the real thing instead of a plastic tree. The American Christmas Tree Association (yes that exists) has published a life cycle assessment of natural Christmas trees vs. plastic trees in 2018. According to this study, the manufacture of an artificial Christmas tree causes 14.2kg of CO2 emissions. Since most artificial trees are manufactured in China they have to be shipped to Europe or North America which causes another 2.4kg of CO2 emissions. Then there is the packaging and other things as well as the CO2 emitted as the trees are collected in the garbage and then stored in landfill where they will remain forever, and you have a total CO2 footprint of artificial Christmas trees of 17.9kg CO2.Meanwhile, a real tree will have to grow, during which time it needs water and fertiliser, both of which create CO2 emissions. But in the 7 to 8 years it takes to grow a 2m tree it also captures a lot of carbon from the air. Thus, by the time your Christmas tree is chopped down and ends up in your house, it has a negative carbon footprint of c. -9kg. Transporting the tree from the plantation to your home is creating a little bit of CO2 in the order of 1.8kg and the water used to keep it alive until you throw it out another 0.08kg. Then, it depends on what happens to the tree. If the tree is burnt after use, it releases all the carbon stored in the wood and more to create a total CO2 footprint over its lifecycle of 7.8kg CO2. If the tree is composted after use, a lot of carbon is released into the air as well and the total CO2 footprint is 4.9kg. Meanwhile, if the tree ends up in landfill and slowly rots there, the total CO2 footprint is negative. It is even better if the landfill is linked to an incinerator power plant where the heat from the landfill is used to produce electricity. In this case, the carbon footprint becomes even more negative.In general, thus, we can say that under normal circumstances, where a real Christmas tree is being collected and then ends up as garden waste and is composted (as is the case throughout most of the UK), the carbon footprint of a real tree is a little bit more than a quarter of the carbon footprint of a plastic tree. If you manage to use your plastic tree for four years or more, you are actually doing something for the environment.But then you would have to live with an ugly plastic tree for four yearsxe2x80xa6I hope I made it clear that Christmas is a major natural catastrophe that we celebrate as if it was a joyous holiday. You could do a lot to reduce your carbon footprint each year as I have described above.But then again, itxe2x80x99s Christmas, and if there is one time of the year, where we should not worry about our carbon footprint that much, particularly in a year like this one, it is then. So enjoy Christmas and if you still feel guilty about your lifestyle during the holidays, just make up for it in January and February.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Really loved this one xf0x9fx98x82Merry Christmas to you and your family xf0x9fx8ex84(what's the food print of this tree xf0x9fx98x89) No posts","title":"Let me ruin your Christmas - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/let-me-ruin-your-christmas"}

In their efforts to reduce costs while still generating above-market returns many pension funds have shifted their assets into smart beta ETFs that try to mimic one factor or another.Meanwhile, the factor zoo has grown bigger and bigger and by now encompasses several hundred anomalies that promise significant outperformance. At least within the sample of the publication exploring the anomaly.The typical procedure for research is to describe the anomaly, and then measure the performance of a long/short-portfolio that is long the 20% best stocks (with regards to the anomaly) and short the 20% worst stocks. You win a prize (i.e. being published in a journal or launching a fund) if the performance of that long/short-portfolio has strong performance.Andrew Chen from the Federal Reserve Board and Mihail Velikov from Penn State recently examined 120 factors that are described in the academic literature. On average, the annual return of the long/short-portfolios formed on a factor had an annual return of almost 8%. That is impressive, but unfortunately, most studies donxe2x80x99t take transaction costs into account. So Chen and Velikov did it for them. Assuming that investors have to pay the typical bid-ask spread for the stocks they trade (the authors make sure to use historical transaction data where available instead of quoted prices that may have a narrower spread than investors pay in real life) the authors conclude that the average annual performance of the long/short-portfolio is lower, but a still-respectable 4.6% per year.But investors today are very much aware of the replication crisis (and if you arenxe2x80x99t, read about it here). Thus, most investors expect the performance of the factor to decline after publication for a number of reasons. And that is what the Chen and Velikov observe as well. After an anomaly has been published, its average performance net of trading costs drops to 1.6% per year.Ugh. Itxe2x80x99s starting to look ugly.But wait, there is more.Stock market trading has changed dramatically in the 21st century. The rise of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading has changed the dynamics of share prices and made it much easier for hedge funds to exploit market anomalies. And when Chen and Velikov looked at the performance of factors net of trading costs and after publication but restricted their sample to data from 2005 onwards, all that was left of the performance of the average long/short-portfolio was a meagre 1% per year or 8bps per month. The average performance of stock market factors in the United StatesSource: Chen and Velikov (2020).But before you abandon factor investing altogether, let me stress two important caveats:The chart above shows the average performance of 120 factor portfolios. Some factors continue to have much better performance than others and indeed, Chen and Velikov show that the two factors that appear in one study after another as the most reliable factors, momentum and value, still have better than average returns after 2005 (despite the underperformance of value in the last decade).There is an increasing amount of studies that show that combining different factors in a portfolio can significantly enhance performance xe2x80x93 something I will discuss in the future.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The future of factor investingâ¦doesnât look promising - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-future-of-factor-investingdoesnt"}

There were several ESG funds that were invested in the stock and one fund that claimed to pay particular attention to labour conditions even had Boohoo as largest holding in its fund.How can something like that happen?Well, if you look at the average ESG rating of Boohoo vs. its closest peers ASOS and Zalando, then it seemed as if Boohoo wasnxe2x80x99t such a bad investment. Measured against a universe of more than 19,000 stocks worldwide, Boohoo was better than 71% of them. Both its peers were slightly better, but essentially all three stocks were in the top third in terms of ESG ratings.Average ESG score for online fashion retailersSource: CSRHubInvestors who only looked at the ratings or the ESG data the companies disclosed could easily believe that Boohoo was a pretty good investment from an ESG perspective. But that overlooks a major problem with ESG investing. Because there is no unified standard of disclosure, every company is free to choose which metric it wants to publish. ESG disclosure is costly for companies (it takes both time and money to collect, analyse and publish the data) and in particular smaller companies often donxe2x80x99t have the resources to disclose as much information as their larger peers. ESG investors and ESG rating agencies obviously want as much information as they can get, but they have to make do with what companies are willing to publish. And, in order not to unfairly penalise smaller companies, they often calculate their ratings or make their investment decisions based on the available data and simply ignore the missing data.But that opens up the possibility for companies to game the system. If you have something to hide, you can simply choose to disclose only favourable information about your company. This way, you look much better to ESG investors and it may be even possible to look better than companies that are following better practices overall but disclose more information about their business.In other words, there is important information for investors is the lack of information. The Fashion Transparency Indexengages with more than 200 fashion brands around the world and checks how much they disclose. Note that they donxe2x80x99t judge if a company has good or bad practices, they only judge how transparent a company is. And if we compare Boohoo to ASOS and Zalando it is obvious that it disclosed much less information than its peers in every category that the Fashion Transparency Index uses. A particularly important red flag is that in the area of traceability, Boohoo scored zero points. They provided absolutely no information to investors and consumers where they buy their clothes or source their raw materials. And of course, that is exactly where the scandal was.Transparency of online fashion retailers by areaSource: Fashion Transparency IndexNow, I am not claiming that Boohooxe2x80x99s management knowingly covered up the scandal and systematically withheld vital information about the working conditions in its suppliersxe2x80x99 factories. That is for the ongoing investigations to determine. But what is clear is that Boohoo could have been flagged as a potentially risky investment from an ESG perspective by looking at how much the company disclosed. It is high time that ESG investors pay more attention to disclosures than they did in the past.

First, they could check if economics students (and by xe2x80x9ceconomicsxe2x80x9d, I mean economics, business, and accounting here) were more biased against women than students in other faculties. Second, they could check if the attitudes towards women changed as the students grew older and learned more about economics, finance, and accounting.Now, one may dismiss this study as irrelevant because Chile is a relatively small country far away, but when it comes to attitudes towards gender, Chile happens to be pretty close to the average of all OECD countries.% of respondents under 25 who agree with the statement: xe2x80x9cWhen a mother works for money, the children suffer.xe2x80x9dSource: World Values Survey.

Note: The UK did not participate in the most recent wave of the survey and is thus excluded.The first result, I would highlight from the study is that the first-year students had a more negative attitude towards women than the average of the Chilean population. The gap in gender attitudes between economics students and other students was about a fifth to a quarter of the size of the gap in gender attitudes between men and women. Hence, it is quite big in practice. Notably, the hostility towards women declined after the #MeToo movement became a global phenomenon. Detailed analysis of the different tests for the participating students showed that much of the decline was due to social desirability effects, that is, while their underlying attitudes about women did not change, students were less willing to provide sexist answers in surveys, etc.  Finally, if one compares the attitudes between first-year students and third-year students one can observe that male students have become significantly more sexist during their university years (something that is not observed for students of other faculties), while female students did not. This provides a strong indication that studying economics does indeed foster a somewhat sexist attitude in men. Why this may be the case is hard to explain. The authors claim that the increased sexism in male students is driven by xe2x80x9cbenevolent sexismxe2x80x9d, i.e. an attitude that men should protect women and through their jobs and careers provide them with financial security. This, of course also means that men find the gender pay gap absolutely normal and see no element of unfairness in that. For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.And The Gap between turkey and Netherlands shows you a big point of tension in the Netherlands.

Russiaxe2x80x99s state-owned oil giant Rosneft has proposed to President Putin the introduction of a systematic hedging programme for its oil production. If implemented, Russia would follow in the footsteps of Mexico and become only the second country in the world to protect its oil revenues against price declines.For those not familiar with the Mexican scheme here are the nuts and bolts:Since 2001, Mexico is hedging its oil exports with Asian options that give the country the right to sell oil at the average price achieved over a predefined time. The options are purchased from a consortium of ten banks who then try to spread the risk across the market by hedging their positions.Like most systematic put option buying the programme has on average cost the country money. The IMF estimates that the cost of the put options averaged 0.1% of Mexicoxe2x80x99s GDP each year. However, in 2009, Mexico made a profit of c $5bn and in 2015 and 2016 a profit of c. $9bn. Thatxe2x80x99s about 0.5% of GDP in 2009 and c. 0.9% of GDP in 2015/2016.However, while the long-term cost to the country exceeded its benefits, the country made a gain exactly when it needed the most and thus was under much less economic pressure in the crisis years than other oil exporters. The IMF estimates that this reduction in the volatility of government revenues has substantially reduced the borrowing costs for Mexico in international bond markets. If these benefits are included in the calculation the hedging scheme of Mexico has been beneficial for the country. In fact, the programme is considered so successful in Mexico that the exact terms of the put options have been made a state secret.What Rosneft has proposed is not quite as sophisticated as the Mexican approach. It proposes to use funds from the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund to purchase regular put options for the next two years of production. The company estimates that it could have earned c $120m in the first half of 2020 had the proposed scheme been in place.The advantages for Russia would be several:Russiaxe2x80x99s economy would be protected against a sudden drop in oil prices and the government would have to make fewer cuts to social programmes in a recession.Russia at the moment has almost no external debt, but with declining borrowing costs, the country could potentially tap into new sources of funding.Russiaxe2x80x99s political power would increase since it would be harder for OPEC to pressure Russia into coordinating its oil production with the cartel.Of course, the last point is probably the main attraction to Putin who triggered a price war in March with his refusal to cut production in the light of the Covid crisis. The risk is, however, that this hedging scheme becomes more popular with other oil producers as well. If every oil-producing country would launch a hedging scheme there would probably not be enough investors willing to take the other side of the trade and the options would either become prohibitively expensive or simply unavailable. Furthermore, the more countries follow this strategy, the more reckless their behaviour can become, and we should see more and deeper oil price crashes in the future. In the end, the temptation of increased domestic stability and international political influence would be bought at the price of rising international economic instability. For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Russia copies Mexico? - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/russia-copies-mexico"}

Based on that description alone, you can imagine what I think of politiciansxe2x80xa6But in the world of economics and investing, some concepts have become articles of faith and dogma as well. One such article of faith is that increasing central bank balance sheets (i.e. printing money) must lead to inflation. And even though the last twelve years in Europe and the United States have shown that all that money printing has not only not led to inflation but if anything had deflationary consequences similar to Japan, some economists and investors insist that the monetary stimulus of 2020 will inevitably tip the scales towards rising inflation.Another article of faith is that high government indebtedness needs to be paid with higher taxes down the road and as such is bad for future economic growth. Thus, if debt becomes too high, we need to engage in austerity measures to balance the budget. Yet, more and more studies show that the austerity measures enacted in Europe and the UK after the financial crisis and the Eurozone debt crisis have caused more damage to growth than high debt-to-GDP ratios ever could.Ten years ago, I believed in both those articles of faith. Like so many Germans, I am naturally averse to debt and fearful of inflation. For some Germans, this aversion to debt and inflation can even become a part of their identity, with sometimes tragic consequences. Today, I have severe doubts that either one of these two articles of faith holds true. And in return, I get ridiculed by people who know me from a decade ago and debated me back then. Their argument is that I have been wrong back then, so why should they trust me today? Well, as Keynes allegedly saidxe2x80xa6When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, Sir?Enter Olivier Blanchard. Blanchard is one of my heroes in economics because he is one of those rare economists that donxe2x80x99t tie their identity to a particular school of thought. In the early 2010s he was Chief Economist of the IMF and pushed hard for austerity measures in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the Eurozone Debt Crisis. In 2013, he made an astonishing U-turn, admitting that he had underestimated the negative consequences of austerity on growth. His reputation xe2x80x93 and the reputation of the IMF xe2x80x93 took a big hit from the mismanagement of the Eurozone Debt Crisis and some people wonxe2x80x99t listen to his views anymore. I say you should listen to him now more than ever and give his views more weight than other economistsxe2x80x99 who act like a broken clock and simply repeat the same dogma over and over again.Today, Blanchard argues eloquently why we shouldnxe2x80x99t introduce austerity measures after this crisis. In short, it is a matter of impact. Austerity measures significantly reduce economic growth. Balancing a budget that would otherwise run a 3% to 5% deficit can easily create a recession in a country emerging from a crisis and almost certainly reduces growth by 1 percentage point or so per year for several years in a row. In the end, the cost of austerity is an almost one to one reduction of GDP in the long run. Meanwhile, cutting the deficit to zero reduces the debt-to-GDP ratio after three to five years by maybe ten percentage points. The impact on the cost of government debt is in the range of a few basis points. Hence, the benefit of reducing debt levels is measured in fractions of a percent of GDP, while the costs are several percentage points of GDP.Austerity measures as practiced over the last decade make no sense and should be avoided. That is not to say that austerity is always ineffective. We know today that the cost of austerity can be reduced if it is backloaded, i.e. a country starts with small austerity measures and then gradually tightens the screw year by year. Similarly, deficit reductions can stimulate business confidence and foster investments overcoming the negative effect on growth from reduced government spending. However, I remain doubtful about these arguments and continue to think that they are correct, but in practice, the impact of austerity on business investment is so small as to be negligible. Otherwise, why didnxe2x80x99t businesses invest like crazy during the last episode of austerity?But just because I remain doubtful about these arguments today, doesnxe2x80x99t mean that I wonxe2x80x99t change my mind. If the facts change, I will change my opinion again in the future.

But since then, markets have recovered, and the question is which stocks are still cheap and which ones are not?Most often, investors try to identify cheap and expensive stocks by using valuation ratios like the price/earnings-ratio, EV/EBITDA, or price/book-ratio. Letxe2x80x99s sidestep the discussion if these ratios are true measures of value or not for the moment and focus on a big challenge that investors face when using these ratios.When it comes to PE-ratios, past earnings are in many instances no longer representative of the current circumstances. Thus, trailing PE-ratios lose their information content because the E is too high, and trailing PE-ratios are artificially low. On the other hand, forward earnings may be more accurate but that assumes that analysts are good at forecasting the next 12 months. And in the current environment, this is extremely hard and nigh impossible because nobody knows how the pandemic will unfold and how consumers and businesses will adjust to a xe2x80x9cnew normalxe2x80x9d. Thus, forward PE-ratios have little to no information content because the E is so uncertain that it could be almost anywhere.The same logic holds if you use EV/EBITDA or similar metrics that rely on some form of corporate earnings.This is why for the time being, I have reverted to using PB-ratios. I know there are systematic issues with book value (see, for example, here) but in the current environment, book values have an important advantage over any kind of earnings or profit metric: they are intrinsically more stable.The chart below shows the analyst consensus for earnings growth and book value growth over the next 12 months for a couple of diversified indices. The estimated change in earnings per share (EPS) or EBITDA is typically more than twice as large as the estimated change in book value per share (BPS). It is typically much harder to get a forecast right for a more volatile indicator than for a more stable one. That is just the nature of forecasting. But if analysts are too pessimistic about future earnings growth (which is entirely possible) then forward PE-ratios are too high (because the E is too low) at the moment and stock markets look too expensive based on forward PE-ratios. Similarly, if analysts are too optimistic about future earnings (which they typically are), then forward PE-ratios look too cheap.Expected earnings and book value growth for indicesSource: Bloomberg.Thanks to the lower volatility of book value, using the PB-ratio as a valuation metric is much more dependable in this market than the other metrics. This becomes extremely clear if we look at individual companies instead of entire indices. Particularly in the hard-hit sectors and industries, it is anyonexe2x80x99s guess how earnings will look like. Just look at the expected earnings growth and EBITDA growth for Exxon, McDonaldxe2x80x99s, and General Motors below. How much uncertainty is there around the expected 90% to 140% decline in earnings (NB: Earnings can swing to losses in which case the decline is more than 100%) compared to the expected 0.5% to 3% change in book value? And thus, how accurate do you think are PE-ratios for these companies vs. PB-ratios?Expected earnings and book value growth for companiesSource: Bloomberg.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"How to measure value these days - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/how-to-measure-value-these-days"}

And when I say psychopath, I donxe2x80x99t mean your casual asocial or unlikeable person, I am talking about clinical levels of psychopathy. One study looked at a representative sample of the British population and assessed them with a standardised clinical test. On average, about 0.6% of the British population met the threshold for psychopathy. Levels of below 1% have been observed around the world. Of course, if you look at the people in prisons or in mental institutions, the prevalence of psychopaths is much higher. In prisons, it is typically around 10% to 15%. Unfortunately, functional psychopaths are often attracted to the business world, where they can compete with others in their business for promotions and influence. Amongst business students, psychopathic traits are more prevalent than amongst psychology students, for example. Another study found that amongst 203 individuals who were selected by their employers for a management development programme, the prevalence of psychopaths was 4%. A survey of Australian white-collar workers showed that c. 5% of workers were suffering from bullying from a psychopathic boss.Today, we know that the influence of psychopathic leaders and co-workers on a business is significant. A new study by researchers from the University of Leicester showed that companies with psychopathic leadership have significantly worse stock price performance than companies with a xe2x80x9cnormalxe2x80x9d leadership. Of course, they didnxe2x80x99t perform a clinical psychopathy test on C-level executives to figure that out. All that was needed was a 280 Dollar software to analyse the annual reports. In other words, you could do it, too.What the researchers did was to use the word choice in annual reports (excluding the financial statements and footnotes) and examine the use of self-referencing words like xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cmyselfxe2x80x9d, or xe2x80x9cminexe2x80x9d and checked the prevalence of these words compared to the average prevalence in corporate reports. Psychopaths use such words more frequently than the average person. Similarly, psychopaths use words that refer to others (e.g. xe2x80x9ctheyxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cthemxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9chexe2x80x9d, or xe2x80x9cshexe2x80x9d) less frequently. Their language pattern is also more aggressive, using words like xe2x80x9cattackxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cconquerxe2x80x9d, or xe2x80x9cdemolishxe2x80x9d more frequently. And, of course, psychopaths tend to deflect guilt on others. They are never at fault. So, they tend to use words like xe2x80x9cundependablexe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cterriblexe2x80x9d or xe2x80x9cstupidxe2x80x9d more often.Measuring the prevalence of these four clusters of words in the front sections of annual reports (where the leadership of a company tries to create a narrative around the results) showed that a one standard deviation increase in psychopathic language led to a c1.5 percentage point drop in share price returns in the year after the annual report was published. Companies that were run by psychopaths had lower morale, less cohesion amongst the team, and suffered more bullying. There are several lessons I learn from these results:As a young analyst, I was trained to largely ignore the front section of a company report, because the real information is in the financial statements and the footnotes. Turns out that there is significant information in the front sections as well.As an investor, it takes a small investment in software to discover a substantial source of risk for your investments that is not priced in the market.As an employee, I prefer to work in an environment with as few psychopaths as possible, where I get along with my colleagues and my bosses. That is worth a lot and in the long run means that I and my business will do better. Life is too short to deal with psychopaths, so donxe2x80x99t do it.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Considering the high percentage of psychopaths in prison, is society better served to have them behind a desk rather than at large and left to their own devices?   Or maybe the moral of the story is that the corporate business world is closer to prison than we care to admit...?  As always, thank you for the thought provoking moment.

Maps shape the way we think about the world and influence us in subtle ways, as I have discussed here. That is why I think it is important to look at the world using different kinds of maps and literally change your perspective of the world.Take for instance isochrone maps. While maps typically try to show the distance from point A to point B, isochrone maps show the travel time. The picture below, for example, shows the travel time from London to different corners of the world. The map on top shows travel time from London in 1914, when we could cross oceans only on ships. The dark red area covers places that could be reached from London within five days, the light red area reaching New York City and Chicago, and so on. Note also, how travel times were dependent on ocean currents and trade winds, so that you could travel faster from East to West than from North to South. This dependency on currents and winds also provides a clue to a fun pub quiz question:Which part of the world was last settled by humans? We know they started in Africa and then moved out in different directions. Ignoring Antarctica, where did humans arrive last?The answer to this question will be given at the end of this post.But coming back to maps, the bottom isochrone map shows travel times from London in 2016. How much our world has sped up can be seen by looking at the legend which is no longer in five-day intervals but quarter-day intervals. In other words, our world has literally become smaller when measured in travel times instead of the usual distances.Isochrone maps of LondonSource: Rome2Rio.But maps can also be used to provide answers to interesting questions. We all know the saying that all roads lead to Rome. That might have been the case during the time of the Roman Empire, but it runs out that it still is the case. The people at Move-lab have randomly chosen almost 500,000 starting points all over Europe and tried to find a road connection to Rome. Turns out it works all the time as the map below shows. And that means that all roads lead to Paris, Berlin, or London as well (as can be seen in the cool maps they show on their website).All roads lead to RomeSource: Move-lab.Similarly, if you include flight routes, it will not surprise you that it is possible to reach an airport in Rome from any other airport in the world. You might have to switch planes a couple of times, but you will eventually get there. Our world today is truly interconnected and people, as well as information, spread much faster than they did in the past. This, of course, should also be reflected in your thinking. If you are thinking of stock markets or the economy in isolation, you will often be surprised by weird behaviour that emerges seemingly out of nothing. Yet, the behaviour could have been anticipated if you also kept an eye on fixed income markets or developments on the political or social front. If we had paid more attention to a virus outbreak in a Chinese province in early 2020, our world today would probably look much different today. The isochrone maps above as well as the connection map should serve as a reminder that what happens in China, doesnxe2x80x99t stay in China. At least not in the 21st century.The solution to the pub quiz: The last place on Earth that was settled by humans was the South Island of New Zealand. The fact that trade winds move from East to West or from West to East means that for many centuries it was much more difficult and dangerous to sail North to South or South to North. Thus, the North Island was settled from Australia pretty soon, while up until c. 750 years ago the South Island remained untouched by human civilisation.

Exactly the opposite of what you should do from a performance perspective.There is at least anecdotal evidence that individual investors have increased their investments and levered up their portfolios since the recovery in April. But how long are they going to hold on to these stocks? Are they going to sell in time before another correction? Or are they going to sell too soon or too late? I have touched on the psychological challenges of buying into a recovery here.But one effect, that I might have underestimated is what academics call xe2x80x9cattention utilityxe2x80x9d and I call the xe2x80x9cI love mexe2x80x9d-effect. It is the all too human tendency to enjoy admiration and success for its own sake. When it comes to investing, we all like a winner, particularly, if we have picked it. So, when we buy stocks or other risky investments and we make a profit, we like to remind ourselves of how smart, successful, beautiful, etc. we are. And in the days of online brokerage that is pretty simple: just log in to your brokerage account and enjoy your success.A study on brokerage account logins has shown that people are much more likely to take a look at their portfolios after they have made a profitable investment than when they have made a losing one. They may not sell their investment; they just want to look at it and enjoy their success. Of course, the problem is that the more often we look at our portfolio, the more we notice short-term fluctuations and even the best stocks will eventually have a small setback that lasts a couple of days. But every time they log in to their accounts, they update their price anchor to the latest top.

Some governments have done well and inspired confidence in the general public, while others have failed.But we do know that some people will be more influenced by the events of 2020 than others. Most notably, we know that people who are in their formative years (age 18 to 25) tend to be more influenced by crises than people in other age groups. There is evidence that if you live through a recession or a period of high inflation during your formative years, it will stay with you for many years and potentially your whole life. I guess there is a reason why psychologists call it the formative years.Renowned economic historian Barry Eichengreen from the University of California in Berkely, Cevat Aksay from Kingxe2x80x99s College, and Orkun Saka from the LSE and the University of Sussex have used these findings as inspiration to check if epidemics and pandemics can have a similar influence on people in their formative years. They used the Gallup World Survey, which asked people in 147 countries on an annual basis between 1920 and 2015 to figure out if epidemics influence political opinions. The Gallup survey doesnxe2x80x99t have any useful economic questions in it, so they used the questions if people had confidence in their government, their political leaders, and in the honesty and integrity of elections as proxies for political views. Because the survey covered more than four decades in countries around the globe, they could measure the effect of all kinds of epidemics, from SARS And H1N1 to Cholera and Ebola.First, they confirmed what everyone suspected. People who were exposed to an epidemic lost confidence in their government. But the effect was generally small except for people in the formative years. Exposure to a typical epidemic led to a 2.5 percentage point drop in confidence in government and political leadership.Effect of a typical epidemic on peoplexe2x80x99s confidence in governmentSource: Aksoy et al. (2020)But what is surprising (at least to me) how long this loss of confidence lasts. The chart below shows the drop in the belief in the integrity of elections of people who were exposed to an epidemic during their formative years. What is remarkable about this chart is that it starts to measure the drop in beliefs not immediately in the epidemic but when the people who were exposed to it have come out of their formative years and are aged 26 to 34 and then every year thereafter. Hence, these are only long-term effects.Long-term effects of epidemics on the confidence in electionsSource: Aksoy et al. (2020).Being exposed to an epidemic seriously erodes young peoplexe2x80x99s belief in elections and (by extension) democracy. If you start to think that elections are rigged anyway, then why bother voting. Or worse, vote for a populist or extremist party to xe2x80x9cteach the establishment a lessonxe2x80x9d.The effect is particularly strong in countries with a weak government at the time of the epidemic, where the strength of the government is measured by the unity of government, legislative strength, and popular support. In other words, the United States currently qualifies as a weak government country while Germany and the UK, for example, do not.The results are a stark reminder that democracies donxe2x80x99t have a natural right to survive. Democracy and freedom have to be defended every day, otherwise, people lose trust in it and start to look elsewhere for alternatives. Let this study be a warning that all of us have cut our work out for the coming years.

In order to do that, nations across the globe have to reduce their CO2 emissions significantly. However, while we know how much CO2 is in the atmosphere, we have a much harder time finding out how it got there.Below is the CO2 emission in the Earthxe2x80x99s atmosphere, going back a cool 800,000 years. I have plugged together three different data sources from the Antarctic to get to this graph. The word unprecedented gets thrown around a lot these days, but in this case, I think it is warranted. Humans are on this planet only for about 250,000 years and today we have the highest concentration of greenhouse gases on the planet for at least 800,000 years.CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over the last 800,000 yearsSource: Luthi et al. (2008), Etheridge et al. (2010), NOAA.So, we know whatxe2x80x99s around, but who is responsible for these CO2 emissions? The chart below shows the CO2 emissions of each country in 2016. Each country is rescaled so that the size of the country represents the total CO2 emissions and the colour of the country represents the CO2 emissions per capita. While China is the biggest emitter of CO2 in the world, its emissions per capita are significantly lower than the United States, Australia or the Middle East. CO2 emissions 2016Source: Worldmapper.orgThe problem with the chart above is that it relies on national estimates for CO2 emissions and those are far more difficult to make than one might expect. Knowable Magazine has a great article that discusses the issues with CO2 accounting that is worth reading in its entirety. Basically, it boils down to three major elements:The use of fossil fuels for industrial purposes has been monitored for a long time. Thus, we can track reasonably well, how much oil gets used in a country and what percentage of that gets burnt etc. Nevertheless, there are still significant estimation errors to keep in mind. Apparently, in one year, Chinaxe2x80x99s CO2 emissions were overstated by 14% because the analysis assumed a lower quality of coal had been used in their power plants. A 14% error in one year may not sound like too much until you realise that in the case of China, this error amounts to the total annual emissions of Germany.What is more difficult to measure are the CO2 emissions of private households. We simply donxe2x80x99t have a good statistical grip on household activities to get a good measurement of CO2 emissions. Yet, households typically are responsible for about one third of the total CO2 emissions of a country. The best we can do today is to survey a representative sample of households and their daily habits and then try to calculate a national aggregate from that.Finally, and most crucially, less than half of CO2 that is emitted ends up in the atmosphere, while the rest gets absorbed in the oceans and the ground. Unfortunately, as oceanxe2x80x99s heat up, they can trap less CO2 and thus become a CO2 emitter in their own right. And as the permafrost in Siberia and Canada starts to melt, it releases large amounts of CO2 as well. So far, we do not really know how much CO2 is emitted from warmer oceans and thawing permafrost xe2x80x93 and how to account for that on a national level. Are Canada and Russia going to be held responsible for the CO2 emitted by thawing permafrost? Can you hold a country to account for something that is beyond its control?In any case, CO2 accounting on a national level is about as tricky as national accounting for GDP, for example. Except that we have decades of experience with estimating GDP. Over the coming decade, CO2 accounting has to improve and organisations like Climate Action Tracker and the International Energy Agency are working on that. Even the European Space Agency is chiming in since it aims to launch a bunch of satellites in 2025 that will be able to track every corner of the planet every three days and resolve CO2 emissions down to 2km distance. My guess is that we will see a lot of surprises once we get that data because today, the incentive for many countries is simply to put lipstick on their emissions pig and massage the data in order to reduce the estimated CO2 emissions. International organisations rely on the statistical data for energy usage, imports and exports of fossil fuels, etc. to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions, but countries that produce coal and gas domestically, for example, can simply under-report the domestic production of these fossil fuels and then burn them without anyone ever being the wiser. Once satellite data is available these discrepancies will become visible, just like satellite data allowed for an independent estimate of GDP growth in countries with letxe2x80x99s say questionable economic statistics. What this means for investors is that CO2 emission certificates, which are already introduced in Europe and will be introduced nationwide in China this year, may all of a sudden become much more expensive. Given that CO2 certificates may already be an interesting investment for this decade since decisive climate action requires a price of carbon that is significantly higher than the current price, the price for these emission schemes may have a significant upside risk from these improvements in carbon accounting.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The difficult task of CO2 accounting - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-difficult-task-of-co2-accounting"}

This move comes after Russia decided not to participate in the OPEC production cuts to stabilise prices after the significant decline in recent weeks.The motivation for Russia to not follow the OPEC decisions was likely driven by its desire to hurt the US shale business. Shale oil production needs oil prices of $50 to $60 per barrel to be profitable. The average production cost of a barrel of crude oil in Russia in 2017 was estimated at $17.20/bbl. but obviously, the marginal costs of production are much higher, and Russia likely needs oil prices in the range of $40/bbl. to $45/bbl. to produce oil profitably. The marginal cost of production of a barrel of crude oil for Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is likely at or below $30 per barrel. I have been writing a book on the impact of geopolitics on the economy and financial markets, which will be published later this year. In what follows, I will draw heavily on the contents of this forthcoming book to help investors put these events into a historical context and assess the short-term and long-term consequences of this move.Historical context:This move by Saudi Arabia is not unprecedented. From February 1982 to October 1985, OPEC tried to control supply to ensure oil prices stayed high during the Iran-Iraq War (see the grey shaded area in the chart below). However, for years, several OPEC members secretly pumped more oil than their quota would allow until Saudi Arabia in October 1985 decided to teach them a lesson and started to expand supply dramatically, thus sending oil prices in a heavy tailspin. Since Saudi Arabia and Iran have the lowest production prices in the world, they could survive the low oil prices much longer than other OPEC members, thus eventually enforcing a discipline amongst OPEC members that has held up to this day. It took several years of low oil prices to enforce this discipline but since Saudi would always be the last man standing, it was just a matter of time until other countries would fall in line. It seems to me that Saudi Arabia is following the same playbook this time around. The announcement today sends oil prices to a level much below the level Russian producers need to be profitable. Russia is extremely dependent on oil and gas exports given the economic sanctions imposed by the West, so it may have seemed plausible by the Russian government to defect from the OPEC agreement to sustain its income and at the same time hurt US shale producers. With todayxe2x80x99s actions by Saudi Arabia the calculation has changed dramatically, and it is only a matter of time until Russia will have to backtrack. How long that will take, however, is anyonexe2x80x99s guess. It may happen in a matter of days or weeks; it may take years.Real price of crude oilSource: Kilian (2009).Impact on the economyLower oil prices tend to be good for the economy since prices for petrol and other consumer goods drop. However, we need to be aware that not all oil price shocks are created equal. To quote from my upcoming book:Kilian differentiates between three different types of oil price shocks, a classification system that has become standard and is important to remember for investors:Supply shocks are driven by unanticipated changes in the production of oil. Supply shocks can be negative, such as when Saudi Arabia had to shut down its Abqaiq oil processing plant after a drone attack in 2019, leading to a decline of global output by 5% overnight. As Kilian (2009) shows, such supply disruptions generally are short-term in nature and while they do lead to a spike in oil prices, they tend not to have a lasting impact on the economy or financial markets.However, the fear of lasting supply disruptions can lead to oil-specific demand shocks if oil importers start to stockpile crude oil in anticipation of a longer outage. For example, if the Abqaiq outage had led to a general concern that Saudi outages could not be recovered quickly, oil consumers may have started to stockpile oil and drastically increase the global demand for this commodity. Similarly, the expectation of a prolonged war in an oil-exporting country or an open-ended restriction of production (e.g. the OPEC embargoes of the 1970s) can trigger such a demand shock. These oil-specific demand shocks are the biggest danger for the global economy because study after study has shown that they lead to spikes in oil prices, drops in stock markets and a decline in economic growth. And what is worse, such oil-specific demand shocks can last a long time and thus cause significant damage to the global economy and financial markets.Finally, Kilian (2009) shows that the most common shocks are aggregate demand shocks which are triggered by a general increase or decline in demand for crude oil. These aggregate demand shocks are essentially a reflection of the global business cycle and will thus not be discussed in detail in this chapter. Suffice it to say, that aggregate demand shocks are the best kind of shocks since they lead to higher oil prices but also to rising stock markets as investors understand that the higher oil prices are a reflection of strong economic growth.This is clearly a supply shock and thus we should not expect it to have lasting implications. Nevertheless, if Russia remains stubborn, the current supply shock could last for six to twelve months and depress oil prices for a prolonged time. In this case, studies on the economic impact of oil price shocks on GDP growth become relevant. The table below is taken from a metastudy of 149 studies performed since the year 2000 that examined the GDP impact of oil price shocks. The table is normalised to a 10% increase in oil prices, so to assess the likely impact on GDP of a 20% drop you need to change the sign and multiply the numbers by 2.If we take the short-term projections as the most likely outcome of the current oil price shock, we can expect a boost in GDP growth of 0.2% to 0.4% for the United States, 0.3% to 0.6% for the UK and 0.2% to 0.3% for the Eurozone. However, we need to take into account that the current Covid-19 epidemic provides a background of negative GDP impulses, especially in the Eurozone where the lockdown in Italy will hurt this economy more than already anticipated. Add to that the weakness in the German economy due to its dependence on exports to China and it seems likely that the economic boost from lower oil prices may be overpowered by the economic slowdown from the epidemic. Similarly, for the UK and the United States, it seems to me that the boost from lower oil prices will be largely counteracted by the negative effects of the Covid-19 epidemic. Estimated impact of a 10% oil price shock on GDP growthSource: Oladosu et al. (2018). Note: ST = up to one year, MT = one to three years, LT = more than three years.Impact on financial marketsNormally, oil price declines tend to be positive for stock markets if it is a supply shock because supply shocks typically happen in times of stable demand. However, with the current Covid-19 epidemic as a backdrop, we are witnessing both a potential decline in demand and an increase in supply. Nevertheless, the increase in supply seems to be much larger than the potential decline in demand, so that the supply shock should dominate the market reaction. In general, this should support stock markets (other than the energy sector). In recent years, however, much emphasis has been paid to the nonlinear reaction of stock markets to oil price shocks. To quote once more from my forthcoming book:The nonlinear reaction of stock markets to oil price shocks has been at the centre of interest in recent years. Reboredo and Ugolini (2016) use a copula approach to investigate spill-overs from oil markets to stock markets and they find that more extreme oil price shocks lead to outsized stock market reactions. The figure below shows the value at risk for the weekly returns of stock markets in developed countries. The dark bars show both the unconditional upside and downside risks of these stock markets and the light bars the upside and downside risks given an oil price shock that is in the top 5% or bottom 5% of the historical distribution. The figure shows that stock markets react much more sensitively to bad news than to good news. For example, the Value at Risk (VaR) for the US stock market over one week with a 95% probability is -4.1% on average. But in times of an adverse oil price shock the VaR more than doubles to -8.3%. In reaction to positive oil price shocks, the VaR only increases from 3.6% to 4.6%.Stock market reaction to oil price shocksSource: Reboredo and Ugolini (2016).SummaryGiven the backdrop of the Covid-19 epidemic and the fear this has induced in financial markets at the moment, it is very difficult to assess the short-term implications for markets. However, if we look beyond these short-term jitters, a supply shock like the one we witness at the moment should only be short-lived in nature. Russia will eventually have to fall in line with OPEC quotas at which point, oil prices should rise to the levels we saw last week. In the meantime, the lower oil prices will provide a small benefit to economic growth in developed countries that helps alleviate some of the negative consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic.For stock markets, any setbacks due to the oil price shock should be short-lived in nature except for energy stocks which may remain depressed until Russia and Saudi Arabia decide to cut production again. The producers most at risk from this oil shock are clearly shale oil producers xe2x80x93 especially those that are highly leveraged. The main beneficiaries of this oil shock should be consumer stocks xe2x80x93 especially producers of energy-consuming consumer goods from cars to airlines.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Assessing the oil shock - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/assessing-the-oil-shock"}

The most infamous cases are maps of electoral districts in the United States that have been heavily gerrymandered to favour one party or another. And even though we now can easily quantify how big the partisan impact of gerrymandering is in a state, the US Supreme Court refuses to rectify the situation. The result is that now, the Republican Party has a distinct advantage in national elections which is why both Donald Trump and George W. Bush could become President with a minority of the total votes cast.Outside the United States, the political consequences of maps have been even more harmful. The British Empire expanded its geographical reach not so much with the cunning use of flags as Eddie Izzard claims, but with the help of colouring areas pink that they did not really control (pink being the colour used in Imperial Shipping Maps to denote areas of British influence).Once the British Empire had to give back control to now sovereign nations, they simply drew straight lines with a pencil on maps to delineate the new territories. The Sykes-Picot line separated the Middle East into English and French spheres of influence. Unfortunately, the line was drawn without any consideration for religious or ethnic boundaries, which is why the Kurds did not get their own territory and were mixed together with Shia and Sunni Muslims in arbitrary regions. These regions later became modern nation-states like Syria and Iraq that to nobodyxe2x80x99s surprise have been mired in conflict for a hundred years now.The Sykes-Picot Agreement and modern nation-states in the Middle EastNow there is a fascinating article in the latest edition of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that looks at the economic consequences of maps and I encourage everyone to read it. In it, the authors explain how Christopher Columbus used the Martellus Map of 1489 as part of his push to explore a westward route to India. The problem with the Martellus map is that it incorrectly enlarged the East-West dimension of the Eurasian continent to span 220xc2xb0 instead of 130xc2xb0. Thus, the westward journey to Japan and India looked much shorter than the eastward route known at the time. Without that mistake, Columbus might not have discovered the Americas, they would not have become a Spanish colony, the gold and silver of the colonies would not have been able to finance Spanish hegemony, and the economic and political fortunes of Spain would have been vastly different.It is easy for us to mock inaccurate maps of hundreds of years ago, but modern maps have economic consequences, too. While both Google Maps and Apple Maps have the same data on roads, buildings, etc. the companiesxe2x80x99 algorithms determine which points of interest are highlighted when the user zooms in and out of these maps. As Justin Oxe2x80x99Beirne shows, Google Maps emphasises transit and transport hubs such as train stations, while Apple Maps emphasises points of interest like tourist spots and restaurants. Obviously, this means that it will likely take you longer to get from A to B if you use Apple Maps, but it also makes it easier for you to find the nearest restaurant or department store. But which restaurant or store Apple Maps highlights is also important. Another study showed that restaurants that were not included in Yelp had on average 5% to 12% lower revenues than similar restaurants nearby that were included in the App. In a notoriously competitive industry like restaurants, this can make the difference between a flourishing business and ruin. The same view of the London West End in Google Maps and Apple MapsSource: Justin Oxe2x80x99Bierne.Because maps and the data they show to users have become economically important, they also have become big business. Licencing fees for Google Maps, TomTom maps or other high-quality maps can easily go into the millions. Unfortunately, the map business is riddled with a lack of competition because a few players dominate each step of the value chain. Reducing licencing costs can have unintended consequences. The electric car maker Tesla originally used Google Maps for its navigation system but changed to cheaper open-source software throughout the 2010s. This means owners of an expensive luxury car now use software that can compete with Google Maps in big cities and affluent areas (where most of these cars are driven) but have a serious lack of information in less populated and rural areas where open-source maps just are not as detailed as Google Maps or other commercial providers. The result were strange routing decisions by Teslaxe2x80x99s navigation system that sent drivers several times over the same highway intersection simply because the data in the system was not precise enough.The list goes on but the lesson is clear. Maps reflect choices made by the maker of the map. And these choices are dominated by the incentives the maker has, be they political or economic. As a result, maps can have a surprising influence on the economic fortunes of businesses and our own choices, both positive and negative. It is fascinating to read about these influences in the Journal of Economic Perspectives.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The economic impact of maps - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-economic-impact-of-maps"}

At an official rate of 3.6%, the unemployment rate in the United States hovers around levels last seen in the late 1960s. In the UK, you have to go back to the mid-1970s to find unemployment rates as low as today.But are these numbers really that exceptional? In the chart below, I have used an HP-filter to de-trend the US unemployment rate and isolate the cyclical component of unemployment. As you can see, the cyclical component is low at 1.1 percentage points below trend, but not exceptionally low. In fact, the cyclical deviation in unemployment is less than it was at the height of the economic expansion in 2000 and 2007 and about the same as in the year before the 1990/1991 recession.US unemployment trend and cyclical componentSource: St. Louis Fed.A similar picture emerges once I de-trend the UK unemployment rate. The cyclical deviation from the trend is about one percentage point, less than in 1989 and 2005/2006.UK unemployment trend and cyclical componentSource: ONS.Looking at it this way, the current cycle looks rather ordinary and similar to previous cycles, which, on the positive side, means that unemployment can decline even further from current levels. Of course, the cyclical deviation depends on the actual unemployment rate as well as the trend. And trend unemployment is declining in both countries for quite some time now.But why should this declining trend be real? After all, just because an econometric filter shows a declining trend that doesnxe2x80x99t mean that trend unemployment is really declining. Andreas Hornstein and Marianna Kudlyak from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco have shown that this declining trend might indeed be real. They used the monthly Current Population Survey of the Census Bureau to look at the movement of individual US citizens between being employed (E), unemployed (U) and out of the labour force (N). This detailed micro data enabled them to estimate the true flows between these three states and construct a real-time estimate of the unemployment rate.The first chart below shows the movement of people from being unemployed to being out of the labour force or being employed. These flows remain relatively stable over time with no visible long-term trend.Flows of unemployed people out of the labour force (UN) or into employment (UE)Source: Hornstein and Kudlyak (2020). Note: NBER recessions are indicated in grey.The second chart shows the flows of people between being employed and out of the labour force (EN) as well as from being out of the labour force to being employed (NE). Again, no long-term trend visible.Flows of employed people out of the labour force (EN) or people newly gaining employment (NE)Source: Hornstein and Kudlyak (2020). Note: NBER recessions are indicated in grey.But now take a look at the flows of people who are out of the labour force and become unemployed (i.e. ready to get a job but canxe2x80x99t find one right away, NU) and people who are no longer employed and become officially unemployed (UE). Since 2008, there is a steady decline in these flow rates. This means that unlike in the past, people no longer claim unemployment benefits. They are far more likely than in the past to drop out of the labour force altogether after losing their job (or voluntarily leaving their job) and they are far more likely to move from being out of the labour force back into employment. Flows of people out of the labour force back into unemployment (NU) and employed people into unemployment (EU)Source: Hornstein and Kudlyak (2020). Note: NBER recessions are indicated in grey.This is the impact of the gig economy on the labour market. If people no longer have standard work contracts, they are no longer eligible for unemployment benefits when they lose their jobs. Hence, they will not bother claiming unemployment benefits but instead drop out of the workforce and go back to school etc. Similarly, if they eventually do find a job, it is unlikely to be a job that they find through traditional job searches but instead, they might just become an Uber driver or get another gig somewhere without any decent work benefits. In this case, they go straight from out of the labour force to being employed. The net effect of these trends is a technical decline in the unemployment rate that has nothing to do with the strength of the economy. Given that we can expect the gig economy to grow in size, we should also expect that unemployment rates will continue to experience a long-term trend lower with cyclical variations around this declining trend.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"How exceptional are current unemployment rates? - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/how-exceptional-are-current-unemployment"}

My favourite example of this behaviour is the use of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) in finance. As most readers of this blog will know, the CAPM was developed in the 1960s by Sharpe and Lintner. The model predicts that financial assets should follow a simple linear model and returns should merely be a reflection of the systematic risk of the asset relative to the market. When I studied towards my economics degree at university, I already had a postgraduate degree in mathematics and physics so I was confronted with the CAPM and thought to myself: xe2x80x9cThis is a nice toy model, but surely nobody thinks that you can describe a complex dynamic system like the financial market with a linear model like the CAPM.xe2x80x9dBut when I entered the world of professional finance and asset management I learned to my astonishment that the largest asset managers in the world would take the CAPM not only seriously, but literally.As a physicist, you are trained to assess a theory or a model in two ways. First, you assess the predictions the model makes in the real world. If it is empirically useful, it probably has some element of truth in it. Milton Friedman famously claimed in his essay xe2x80x9cThe Methodology of Positive Economicsxe2x80x9d that one should not judge a model by the realism of its assumptions. That is, of course, total nonsense and unworthy of a genius like Friedman. It is nonsense because there are a large number of random models can make predictions that are remarkably accurate. All the examples of the butter price in Thailand being highly correlated with the price of oil in the United States or the like are such cases of false causalities. But letxe2x80x99s stay with the argument of empirical accuracy for the moment.The CAPM has been violated not just once, but hundreds of times. Factor investing started with the seminal research of Eugene Fama and Ken French in the 1990s who described the value and size factors. By now, researchers have discovered more than 300 different investment factors. And remember what an investment factor such as value or momentum is. It is a statistically significant violation of the CAPM observed in the market. Karl Popper tells us that a theory should be abandoned xe2x80x93 or at least modified xe2x80x93 once it has been empirically violated and so, I cannot understand how professional investors or academics still use the CAPM as a viable benchmark or model to describe the world. In the natural sciences, you would be laughed out of the room if you tried to defend a model that has empirically been violated hundreds of times, yet in finance, companies make money with recommendations derived from the CAPM and academics win prizes for research based on it. Indeed, for academics, a safe career path has been to start with the CAPM and work on an extension of the model that relaxes some of its famously unrealistic assumptions:Investors aim to maximise their utility function (Never mind that nobody can measure a utility function or even knows how such a function looks like in principle).Investors are rational and risk-averse (Never mind that we by now have forty years of evidence how investors deviate from this assumption, it is still used as a fundamental building block).All investors trade without transaction costs and are not taxable (Remind me to ask the HMRC for tax exemption so I can optimise my investments).Investors can borrow and lend unlimited amounts under the risk-free rate of interest (Great, Ixe2x80x99ll buy myself a villa in the Caribbean and send the mortgage application to my bank telling them to go to Bill Sharpe and let him explain why they should give me the money at the risk-free rate of interest).Investors are price takers and cannot influence prices (Ok, this seems like a reasonable assumption).All investments are highly divisible into small parcels (This used to be doubtful, but in the 21st century it is true for all practical purposes).All information is available to all investors at the same time (Calling Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, Raj Rajaratnam, Steve Cohenxe2x80xa6).That academics still use the CAPM a lot can be seen by searching for the CAPM in Google Scholar, the search engine that restricts hits to academic papers. Over the last 20 years, CAPM-related papers have grown roughly at the same rate as papers mentioning the research of Fama and French (which I used as a proxy for work on factor investing). Of course, I cannot say, how many of these papers are critical of the CAPM and how many are supportive, but my impression from scanning the results is that the vast majority of papers mentioning the CAPM try to use the CAPM either as a benchmark model against which to test empirical predictions or try to expand the CAPM by modifying some of the above-mentioned assumptions.Academic research papers referencing CAPM and factor modelsSource: Google Scholar.At least, the larger investment community seems to slowly abandon the CAPM. The chart below shows the 12-month moving average of Google searches for the CAPM, Fama and French as well as factor investing. While searches of CAPM and Fama and French are declining, factor investing as a topic has become more popular, indicating that investors are increasingly using more realistic approaches to investing.Google searches for CAPM and factor investingSource: Google Trends.Which brings me to the second way in which physicists tend to assess the validity of a model, by assessing the realism of the assumptions underlying the model. As you might have guessed, the assumptions of the CAPM shown above are so fundamentally flawed and violated in practice that the entire model is beyond repair. The academic efforts to expand the CAPM into a multi-factor model or relax some of its assumptions are in my case just efforts to ride a dead horse.And my belief that the CAPM is a dead horse comes from more than a refutation of any of the assumptions underlying the model. It comes from a belief that the entire process of modelling financial markets is based on a flawed assumption: the wisdom of crowds.Almost all models in finance and economics are built on the core assumptions that individual investors may not be rational, may be taxable or face other frictions like transactions costs, but if you average them out, the market overall acts as if the assumptions were true.It is the assumption made so often about the wisdom of crowds described so elegantly by James Surowiecki. Yet, many people tend to forget that there are some fundamental requirements that have to be met for a wise crowd to emerge. As Surowiecki points out in his book:There has to be a diversity of opinions.Peoplexe2x80x99s opinions cannot be influenced or determined by other people but have to be fully independent.People can draw on localised or specialised knowledge that informs their opinion.A mechanism to aggregate different opinions fairly and quickly must exist.Each person trusts the collective opinion to be fair and unbiased.In financial markets only conditions one and four are met. Financial markets are a fantastic mechanism to aggregate millions of individual opinions quickly and efficiently. That is what markets are all about. But in practice, peoplexe2x80x99s opinions are not independent. Instead, we are influenced by the media, expert opinions and influencers, our friends and family and even our past experiences. This gives rise to herd behaviour and collective misjudgement in various forms. Indeed, whenever a company executive goes on TV to spin his business as a success story he or she tries to influence a large part of the public to NOT make independent judgements. And similarly, it is by far not obvious why each person trusts in the fairness of the collective opinion. In the age of fake news and the rise of conspiracy theories, the belief in the fairness of the system (be it the political or financial system) is eroding fast and leads to a breakdown of the wisdom of crowds.In the end, I believe that every theory that assumes representative agents (i.e. an average decisions maker who represents the entire population) is doomed to fail. There simply does not exist such a representative agent, rational or irrational. The world is full of people with different beliefs and motivations that cannot be averaged out and it is high time we devote more efforts to develop theories that reflect this diversity.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The models that wonât die - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-models-that-wont-die"}

In my view, one of the key driving forces behind the interpretation of the Covid-19 outbreak is motivated reasoning. For those who donxe2x80x99t know about motivated reasoning, it is our tendency to use facts in the way that best fits our motivations and serves to further our goals. In short, we think we argue like scientists but what we do instead is argue like attorneys. Politicians and pundits do that all the time and you can see it in action with President Donald Trump and his White House aides. At his press conference on the Coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, he held up a page from the Global Health Security Index that showed the United States and the UK are the two countries most prepared to withstand a pandemic. However, the report also states in bold letter that:xe2x80x9cNational health security is fundamentally weak around the world. No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address.xe2x80x9dThere is a reason why the colour coding for the index ranges from yellow to orange and red. No country scored enough points to warrant a green coding. While the White House has an incentive to spin the facts in its favour to avoid a drop in Trumpxe2x80x99s approval ratings that could damage his re-election chances, financial markets have gone into full panic mode based on a different kind of motivated reasoning. The bull market of the last decade has long been derided as the most hated bull market in the world. Even though the US economy was strong and company profitability was good, people were constantly arguing about high valuations and how all of this has to end in tears.Now, we have got an external factor that can shock the Chinese and global economy in ways that are hard to assess. So all kinds of pundits can bend the facts to fit their worldview. Is it any surprise that Nouriel Roubini is suddenly coming out of the woodwork, warning that the worst is yet to come for markets? I think Josh Brown of Ritzholtz Wealth was spot on in his initial assessment on Twitter:February 26th 2020Markets needed a reason to sell and Covid-19 provided one. The fact is that nobody really knows what the effect of Covid-19 will be on the Chinese and the global economy. Currently, most economists agree that the impact on Chinese GDP growth will likely be in the range of 0.5% to 1.0%. Yesterday, the OECD published its assessment predicting a c. 1.0% decline in Chinese growth. I have yet to see a serious economist who predicts a decline in Chinese growth of 2% or more this year.And while economists are no epidemiologists, we are able to assess the likely impact a Chinese growth shock will spread throughout the world. Shagil Ahmed and his colleagues from the Federal Reserve have recently estimated the spread of a severe economic shock in China throughout the world. In their paper, you can find the impact of a one percentage point decline in Chinese GDP on economic growth around the world. The chart below is taken from their paper and shows the impact of such a growth slowdown in China on the global economy. Global spillover of a 1% growth slowdown in ChinaSource: Ahmed et al. (2019). Note: AFE = Advanced Foreign Economies (i.e. developed countries outside the USA), EME = Emerging economies.A one percentage point decline in Chinese growth should reduce US growth by about 0.2 percentage points and developed market growth by about 0.5 percentage points. This is clearly not enough to put the US economy anywhere near recession. However, vulnerable countries like Germany and Italy will likely be hit hard enough to trigger a recession. My opinion remains that Germany and Italy are already in recession and France may slide into one if Chinese growth slows down as expected.Such a growth slowdown would not be nice, but it isnxe2x80x99t the end of the world either. What we should expect as a reaction of financial markets is shown in the next chart. In short, commodities would be hit the hardest with oil prices declining by about 20% and not recovering for a long time while metals prices decline by about 15% and then recover a bit. One would also expect a one to two percentage point drop in world trade a stoner US Dollar and a brief decline of US Treasury yields. All of these things and more have happened since the beginning of the year. If I compare the market action of the last week, I would say that last weekxe2x80x99s panic has significantly overshot the likely impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy and financial markets.Financial market impact of a 1% growth slowdown in ChinaSource: Ahmed et al. (2019). Note: AFE = Advanced Foreign Economies (i.e. developed countries outside the USA), EME = Emerging economies.Now, I can hear the pessimists say that the last week, we have seen evidence that Covid-19 spread to Europe, the United States and other countries and now threatens to become a global pandemic. Hence, the economic impact may be much worse than these simulation show.To this, I reply that SARS spread around the world in 2003 without much of an economic impact either. The main reason why the Chinese economy is likely to slow down significantly is not because of the death toll of the virus. It is because China essentially shut down its economy for several weeks to contain the virus. In the developed world, you simply cannot shut down an entire region and lock people into their houses to stop the pandemic. This is why it is likely that the virus will continue to spread around the world, but at the same time, life will go on. People may shop less in stores but more online. Factories will continue to operate and offices will be filled with people working on whatever they are working on every day. Even if the Covid-19 epidemic can never be contained and will linger on forever, the likely impact on the economy is going to be small. The chart below is taken from a study about the economic impact of SARS, assuming on the one hand that the epidemic was short-lived and on the other hand, that it persisted for 10 years with recurring outbreaks. As you can see, while the Chinese economy might suffer more than the currently anticipated one percentage point, the Western world will likely be fine. Estimated economic impact of SARS pandemicSource: Lee and McKibbin (2004).To summarise, my assessment is that the Covid-19 pandemic is bad and will likely get worse before it gets better. But the economic impact is likely going to be limited. That means that the current market panic is probably overdone. It may sound weird, but if you are trying to overcome motivated reasoning (which I hope I have done here, though I cannot be sure), you will have to learn to be pessimistic and optimistic about the same thing at the same time. Maybe that is why it is so hard for us to deal with facts as scientists do. It often requires us to hold two contradictory views at the same time.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Motivated reasoning in action - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/motivated-reasoning-in-action"}

Twenty years ago the UC Davis Professor published the monolithic xe2x80x9cTrading is Hazardous to Your Wealthxe2x80x9d with Terrence Odean. This paper has become the go-to resource for everyone who wants to understand why trading leads to lower performance and it is one of the papers that I have referred to most often in my career. Now, he seems to have done it again. Together with Aday Morse and Ayako Yasuda, he estimated how much performance investors are willing to forego to invest in socially responsible investments. One common complaint about ESG investing is that it is unclear if it leads to similar, higher or lower returns than traditional investment approaches. I have written several times about that issue before, but the fundamental question really is not if ESG investing has returns that are different from traditional investments. It is whether investors care about these differences?One of the most common reactions I get from traditional investors on ESG investing is that it may well lead to lower returns than traditional investments, if not in recent years than possibly in the future. If ESG investing is truly an approach to reduce exposure to certain risks then green investments should have lower expected returns in the long run simply because they are less risky. The argument of many traditional investors is that it surely would be better to invest in traditional portfolios that maximise returns and use the higher returns to do good in the world through philanthropy. That would be the rational thing to do.But people are not rational. Investors who really care about the environment or societal problems would have a moral conflict if they knew they had stocks of fossil fuel companies etc. in their portfolios. And every financial adviser who works with investors knows that they are willing to forego a lot of returns for the benefit of being able to sleep well at night.With a simple, yet ingenious approach, Brad Barber and his colleagues managed to estimate how much return investors are willing to forego to sleep well at night. They looked at 4,659 venture capital (VC) and growth equity funds from 1995 to 2014. Out of these VC funds, they isolated 159 funds that were impact-investing funds. Impact investing is even stricter than traditional ESG investing insofar as creating a positive societal impact with your investments is a mandatory part of the investment profile. Greenwashed traditional investments or investments in companies and projects that are beneficial to society by coincidence (like health, education or clean energy) are not impact-investing funds. Thus, we do not have to worry too much about all the grey areas of ESG investing in the interpretation of this study.The second advantage of their study is that it looks at private equity vehicles instead of public equities or mutual funds. This has the advantage that investors commit their capital at the beginning of the investment period and then are locked up for several years. So, we donxe2x80x99t have to worry about investor capital flows and can compare the investments in impact-investing VC funds with traditional funds closed at the same time. Given these advantages, the researchers find that ex post, impact-investing VC funds have IRRs that are on average 4.7 percentage points lower than traditional funds. That is a lot. Yet, what really matters is if investors are willing to forego such high returns ex ante (i.e. when they make their investments). It turns out that investors are willing to cut impact-investing funds a lot of slack. Our first chart looks at the excess IRR relative to the median VC fund performance investors are willing to forego in different regions. In Asia, investors are not willing to forego any performance in an impact-investing fund, while in North America investors are on average willing to forego about 1.3% return per year. In Europe, the willingness to pay for impact-investing funds is almost three times as high and investors are willing to forego about 3.6% per year in return for the benefit of having funds in their portfolios that match their values. Over a ten-year investment period that is a cumulative return of 42% left on the table for the ability to sleep well at night.Amount of return deficit that investors are willing to accept in impact-investing fundsSource: Barber et al. (2019). If we look at the types of investors that are most willing to forego returns for the benefit of investing in impact-investing funds, we see that institutions that face public pressure about their investments are willing to forego more returns. Banks, insurance companies and public pension funds are increasingly in the spotlight and targeted by divestment campaigns to sell existing holdings in unsustainable investments. Because of this public accountability, these institutions are often willing to invest in ESG investments and impact-investing funds even if it means giving up substantial returns. The reduced political pressure is worth a lot for these institutions. It is important to note that this trend towards increased public accountability of institutions is, if anything, accelerating. In Europe, definitions and benchmarks of what constitutes a sustainable economic activity are currently under development and in a few yearsxe2x80x99 time, all institutional investors will have to report their investment performance relative to these definitions and benchmarks. As always, once deviations become transparent, the pressure to adhere to these higher standards of investments will increase and institutional investors in Europe will invest even more in ESG assets.Amount of return deficit that investors are willing to accept in impact-investing fundsSource: Barber et al. (2019). Finally, the study also looks at the kind of topics that investors consider important impact investing topics. The chart below shows that investments that try to improve the environment, fight poverty or help minorities and women are highly priced amongst investors while social infrastructure (hospitals, schools etc.), regional development or funding for small and medium enterprises command only a small premium. Amount of return deficit that investors are willing to accept in impact-investing fundsSource: Barber et al. (2019). I can already hear the ESG sceptics complain that this only proves that people are stupid. Why would anyone willingly give up so much return? But the problem is not that people are irrational. They are just different and have different values and preferences. On Wednesday, I will write about one of the most fundamental mistakes economists make in their models, namely to assume that there is an average investor that can be used to understand the market. ESG investing is a prime example that this assumption of average investors is wrong. Only if you accept that there are different groups of investors with different preferences can you understand ESG investing and other trends in the world today.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The most important paper to understand ESG investing - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-most-important-paper-to-understand"}

That post triggered several reactions from readers who xe2x80x93 rightfully xe2x80x93 mentioned that the shadow economy isnxe2x80x99t necessarily bad. Some of it is simply a reflection of the way we measure GDP. The professional nurse, who cares for an elderly person and receives a salary is added to GDP, while the person who stays at home and cares for his or her elderly parent does not. GDP only accounts for monetary benefits if they are actually charged.Also, the shadow economy might look very different in different countries. As one reader pointed out, in countries suffering from civil wars and terrorist insurgencies the shadow economy mostly consists of illegal and criminal activities. The spread of the internet and social media has made it easier for organised crime to establish links with local insurgents and revolutionaries in the developing world. And since laws are typically not enforced and borders relatively easy to cross in a war-torn country, it has become increasingly easy for organised crime to create global value chains by cooperating with local insurgents. Usually, these global value chains focus on the production and export of natural resources and agricultural products. There is a reason why Afghanistan dominates the global production of opium and heroin and Colombia is the worldxe2x80x99s biggest hub for coca production. And in Afghanistan, the opium trade is controlled by the Taliban, while the FARC rebels in Colombia dominated the coca trade in the past. The cooperation between local insurgents as producers and international crime syndicates as distributors is beneficial for both parties. Organised crime doesnxe2x80x99t have to establish local dominance to control the production of natural resources, while insurgent groups can finance their struggle with the export of these products. In recent years, some insurgents even have become logistics operators themselves. For example, cocaine is increasingly smuggled from Latin America to Europe via West Africa where local insurgencies such as Boko Haram finance their operations with trafficking drugs destined for Europe.In industrialised countries, on the other hand, criminal activities and corruption typically only account for a small part of the shadow economy. A 2013 survey in the European Union tried to identify the main reasons why people engaged in the local shadow economy. Trying to avoid high income taxes and social security contributions accounted for c. 40% to 50% of the size of the shadow economy. However, as our chart below shows, the tax rate is not necessarily a determining factor of the total size of the shadow economy. The average size of the shadow economy in industrialised countries is about the same whether you look at low tax countries like Switzerland or Singapore or at countries with famously high taxes, such as the Scandinavian countries or Australia. Other important factors that motivate people to participate in the shadow economy are bureaucracy and labour market regulations that make it hard to engage in legal work or the fear to lose social security payments. In other words, the shadow economy in industrialised countries consists mostly of people who are employed illegally to circumvent social security obligations or continue to claim benefits despite being gainfully employed.Armed with these insights, researchers conclude that to reduce the size of the shadow economy it isnxe2x80x99t enough to simply reduce taxes. In fact, cutting taxes and social security benefits will likely do nothing to prevent people from participating in the shadow economy. Instead, what is effective is the reduction of red tape and entry barriers to legal work. This can come in the form of reduced qualification requirements for certain jobs or partial payment of social benefits for people who come out of unemployment.And as always, the best way to reduce the size of the shadow economy is the hardest to implement in practice. It has become increasingly clear that people who experience the value of paying taxes first hand are least likely to avoid them. Countries like Sweden may have high tax rates, but citizens experience the value for money of their taxes every day in the form of free health care, education and other services. If the perceived value for money of taxes declines and citizens lose trust in the government and the democratic process, they are more likely to drop out of the legal economy as well.Estimated size of the shadow economy in selected countriesSource: Medina and Schneider (2019).For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The make-up of the shadow economy - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-make-up-of-the-shadow-economy"}

As I have said in a recent post, it isnxe2x80x99t at all clear whether China will be able to avoid the middle income trap xe2x80x93 the phenomenon that economic growth starts to fall rapidly in some countries once they reach GDP per capita levels somewhere around $10,000 to $15,000.That there is a clear risk of a middle income trap can be seen in the chart below. It shows the regression coefficient between economic growth and starting GDP per capita for a set of 89 countries. For low income and high income countries, the regression coefficient is negative, meaning that countries with lower GDP per capita have higher growth rates. This is what one would expect since these poorer countries start from a lower base and can increase growth by reducing inefficiencies in the economy. However, the chart also shows that for GDP per capita between $317 and $1,808 in 1960 Dollars ($2,738 and $15,601 in 2019 Dollars), the coefficient turns positive, meaning that countries with lower GDP per capita subsequently have lower economic growth. This is the middle income trap when some countries stop catching up with high income countries. The empirical connection between starting GDP per capita and future growthSource: Feng et al. (2019). Note: The horizontal axis is the natural logarithm of 1960 GDP per capita, the vertical axis is the regression coefficient with future real GDP growth.Despite years of research, it is unknown which factors drive the transition from middle income to high income and which factors trap some countries in middle income status. Take Mexico and Poland, for example. Both Mexico and Poland are middle income countries that border on a large highly developed economy (The United States in the case of Mexico and the European Union or Eurozone in the case of Poland). Both countries are linked to these large developed economies with free-trade agreements enabling them to import and export goods freely. Both countries compete with lower labour costs for foreign direct investments. Yet, between 1980 and 2019, Mexicoxe2x80x99s GDP per capita growth was a mere 0.8% per year, while Polandxe2x80x99s was 2.5% per year. As Homi Kharas and Indermit Gill point out: xe2x80x9cIn the early 1980s, after the oil price shock, Mexicans were 50% richer than Poles. Today, Poles are 50% richer than Mexicans.xe2x80x9dIt seems as if Mexico is a victim of the middle income trap while Poland is not. While there seems to be no universal driver or set of factors that can push a country into the middle income trap, there are a few cases that illustrate the potential pitfalls. Faced with a declining labour cost advantage, some middle income countries try to encourage investments in high-tech industries even though they lack the crucial infrastructure to support such industries. They are lacking a suitably educated workforce, required investment capital and a stable legal system. On the other hand, they may be bogged down by corruption and high regulatory barriers that scare off foreign investors. Another observation is that countries that successfully migrate from middle income to high income status seem to do this based on a specialisation of the economy in some niche areas. Just think of South Korea and Japan that specialised in the machinery, electric and automotive industry. Similarly, Poland and other successful Central European countries specialised in becoming suppliers to the automotive and machinery industry in Europe. Mexico, on the other hand still has an export sector mostly focused on agricultural products and natural resources.Jungsuk Kim and Jungsoo Park from the Asian Development Bank point out that countries that successfully transition from middle income to high income status manage to create positive factor productivity growth while countries that remain trapped in middle income status have negative factor productivity growth.To turn this around, and focus on China as the most important middle income country in the world right now, this seems to imply that China needs to stimulate its productivity growth by increasing its educated and highly skilled workforce, reduce regulatory barriers and focus on high-tech industries where the country can catch up with the West or even leapfrog Western competitors. In some sense, China is on a good path here since the country is educating more students in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) than any other country in the world, it is increasingly opening some of its industries to Western investors (e.g. the automotive industry, banking or the pharmaceutical industry) and its Made in China 2025 strategy focuses on developing capabilities in crucial high-tech industries like AI, robotics, and electric vehicles. These are promising developments and the right steps to foster continued strong growth.On the other hand, we know that countries trapped in middle income status often suffer from a lack of creative destruction. Unlike high-tech countries like Germany, Switzerland or the United States, they do not have a large number of privately owned small- and mid-cap companies that are developing new technologies and are hotbeds of innovation. Instead, a large part of the economy is in the hands of unproductive zombie companies or conglomerates that have domestic monopolies and no incentive to innovate. The keiretsu system of company cross-holdings in Japan and the accompanying zombie banks have contributed to decades of minuscule growth there. Meanwhile, state capture by an elite class of industrialists has destroyed the competitiveness of many industries in countries like Brazil or South Africa. Unfortunately, in China the state-owned enterprises (SOE) control large parts of the economy. These SOE are controlled by party members and suffer from extremely low productivity. If they arenxe2x80x99t opened up to private and international competition in the future, China risks being dragged down by these millstones of the economy. But with the economic slowdown in China due to the trade war with the United States and now the Coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese government relies heavily on these SOEs to boost industrial output. And this means that these SOE become relatively more important in the Chinese economy not less. The result has been a continued decline in Chinese productivity growth in recent years. So far, the situation is not too bad and productivity growth remains positive, but the trend is certainly not Chinaxe2x80x99s friend here.Chinese productivity growthSource: University of Groningen.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Avoiding the middle income trap in China - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/avoiding-the-middle-income-trap-in"}

This question is highly relevant for many reasons, but currently, the most common question, investors ask if ETFs can cause market failure or some form of systemic risk. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has recently published a wonderful overview paper on the research that has been done to investigate the potential systemic risk ETFs pose.I wonxe2x80x99t discuss the question of ETFs as a systemic risk here, but one thing that worries me is that the rise of passive investments can xe2x80x93 at least theoretically xe2x80x93 lead to a misallocation of capital insofar, as relative valuations between stocks are locked in. If Apple is overvalued and suddenly the whole world switches to index funds based on market cap weighted indices, then Apple would remain overvalued forever because nobody would actively underweight Apple shares relative to the market and drive down the share price.In order for markets to remain as efficient as possible, we need active investors who deviate from benchmark indices. And here comes the good news: it seems as if there are still plenty of investors around who do just that.A paper by Ralph Koijen, Robert Richmond and Motohiro Yogo looked at the ownership structure of stock markets in the US, the UK and some other regions and tried to identify the influence of different investor groups on stock prices. They differentiated between seven different investors:Investment advisers: These are the big asset management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity.Mutual funds: These are the true mutual fund firms that are owned by the investors, like Vanguard.Hedge fundsPrivate BanksBrokersLong-term investors: These are the classical institutional investors like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and endowments.Private householdsThe chart below shows the share of ownership of the US and UK stock markets for each of these seven investor types. In both markets, as indeed in every major stock market, the largest group of investors are the investment advisers followed by private households, mutual funds and long-term investors.What makes the research of Koijen and his colleagues so interesting is that they looked at how demand for stocks changed as different characteristics of a stock, like valuation, profitability etc. changed. And this is where the good news for investors starts. The researchers found that as stock characteristics change, the investment advisers and hedge funds react and change their stock holdings. Hedge funds react most sensitively to changing characteristics of stocks, but because they are such a small part of the overall market, their impact on share prices is relatively small. However, the impact of the investment advisers is much larger, both because they shift demand for stocks as their characteristics change and because they control about one third of the market.Despite the rise of ETFs and other passive investment vehicles, investment advisers, hedge funds and mutual funds still move prices and create a levelling force that makes markets more efficient. The researchers estimate that if all investment advisers would suddenly switch their portfolios to passive index portfolios, the market cap of the US stock market would increase by about 30.2% and in the UK by about 8.6%. Some of the largest stocks in the world, like Apple and Alphabet, would see their market cap jump by about two thirds if investment advisers would all switch to passive investing. Why? Because on average these active investors are underweight some of the biggest companies in the world. On the other hand, they tend to be overweight smaller companies and high growth companies, which would lose market cap if investment advisers would switch to passive. Thus, their research indicates that active managers are still the ones who set market prices for different companies and neither passive investors nor long-term investors and households seem to have a material influence on stock market prices. They continue to remain price-takers. And that, in turn means, that markets, at least for now should remain relatively efficient. As long as prices are driven by active managers (be they investment advisers, mutual funds or hedge funds) there is a competition of views that drives stock markets towards a more efficient state. That does not mean that active managers get it right. We all know they donxe2x80x99t and the result can be serious deviations from fair value in single stocks or the overall market. But at least we know, the markets are not broken due to the rise of passive investing. I think, we should repeat the study of Koijen and his colleagues regularly to see if the influence of active investors on stock prices declines over time. And if we see that the influence of active investors becomes marginalized, then we can start worrying about the risks of ETFs to the market.Share of ownership of stock marketSource: Koijen et al.

For an overview of the series and links to the other parts, click here.xe2x80x9cAs expert captains are wont to cause, when all things are quit, at rest and at peace, that the watch nevertheless be duly kept.xe2x80x9dErasmus of RotterdamIn another blog post, I have told the story about a taxi ride I had where the driver told us that in his experience the most dangerous time to drive is Saturday, when the sun is shining and itxe2x80x99s a school holiday. Why? Because that is when people let their guard down, become less alert and more prone to cause an accident. In a rainstorm, on the other hand, people know it is dangerous to dive so they are more alert and watch out for any sign of danger on the road.The same thing tends to be true in financial markets. On 20 November 2006, the VIX, the so-called fear gauge of the US stock market, dropped below 10 points for the first time ever. And since the VIX measures implied one-month volatility for options on the S&P 500 this means that investors on average expected the volatility of the index to be below 10% over the coming month. Back then, nobody was talking about hedging portfolios against a potential crisis and hardly anyone was investing in absolute return products that promised to limit losses in a bear market. Absolute return products only became fashionable in the aftermath of the financial crisis when investors were so shocked by the recent events that they wanted to buy protection for the next crisis. Of course, today, ten years into a strong bull market, absolute return products have become unfashionable once again since they have been unable to keep up with the strong returns of stock markets.In the chart below I have gone through the daily levels of the VIX since its inception in 1990 and looked at events with the 5% highest levels of the fear index. In order to avoid double-counting extended events like the financial crisis of 2008, I have enforced a blackout period of three months before a new event was counted. This means that if the VIX spikes into the top 5% of its historic range (no forward looking bias), I wait at least three months before I count another VIX spike as a new crisis.If we look at the three bars on the right of this chart we can see a clear pattern that the median level of the VIX in the three months before the crisis tends to be quite low, then the VIX spikes and in the three months after the crisis, the level of the VIX remains elevated. This is a reflection of investors fighting the last war. They remain concerned about the last crisis until the memory of it fades and option-implied volatility declines again to more normal levels.VIX levels before and after a crisisSource: BloombergBut looking at the left bar of the chart which shows the median level of the VIX over its entire history shows something else: In the runup to a crisis, the VIX was already somewhat elevated. So, the VIX was signalling some concern in markets but many investors were lulled in by low market volatility that they did not notice or did not react to these early warning signs. In an unpublished paper, I have looked in detail at the relationship between the VIX and the return of the S&P 500 in subsequent months. If you want a copy, feel free to email me and I will send you a pdf. Below is a chart from the paper that shows the average return of the S&P 500 over three months depending on the level of the VIX at the beginning of the three-month period. I have grouped the VIX level into five equal quintiles. The quintile with the lowest VIX levels covers VIX levels up to 13, the second quintile covers VIX levels between 13 and 15.8, then from 15.8 to 19.3 for the middle quintile, 19.3 to 24 for the fourth quintile and levels above 24 for the highest quintile. The interesting observation is that the return of the S&P 500 is high when VIX levels are very low. When markets are calm, they tend to remain calm for a long time. This is why investors get lulled in so easily by calm markets. It is only when calm markets give way to more choppy behaviour that expected stock market returns tend to become negative. And of course, once the crisis hit, then it is too late and stock expected stock market return become very high again because nothing is better for markets than a crisis settling down again. Stock market return based on starting level of VIXSource: BloombergThis behavioural lull can be exploited by investors. Because market crises usually donxe2x80x99t come out of the blue but have early warnings signs, a good strategy for investors can be to monitor the VIX level and look when it rises from very low levels to more average or slightly elevated levels. In those circumstances, there often still is enough time to reduce risk in a portfolio or hedge risks at a reasonably low cost. Of course, the crisis may never come, and markets may calm down again, but that will just create an even more intensive lull that makes the next crisis more dangerous.Stock market return based on VIX movementSource: BloombergPS: The current level of the VIX is in the second quintile of its historic distribution so no warning signs there. However, we had a crossover from the third to fourth quintile in late August, which indicates that the next two to three months are likely to be quite volatile for stock markets.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The Virtuous Investor: Rule 9 - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-virtuous-investor-rule-9"}

In three simple charts this paper clearly demonstrated the dire straits public pension funds are in.Letxe2x80x99s first take a look at the official funding ratios (the ratio of assets relative to the present value of future liabilities) of the 100 or so public pension plans in their sample. In 2001, the average funding ratio was close to 100% but despite the strong returns of stock markets and declining yields in Treasuries that boosted returns on all fixed income asset classes the average funding ratio declined to about 70% in 2016.Funding ratios of public pension funds in the USSource: Lu et al. (2019).And these are only the official funding ratios. Currently, generally accepted accounting standards require pension fund liabilities to be discounted by a discount rate derived from the asset mix of the pension fund. But why the risk and timing of liabilities should be related to the risk and timing of equity returns, for example, is anyonexe2x80x99s guess. It makes no sense to use equity returns as input into the discount rate for pension fund liabilities. Instead, as practically every pension fund expert in the world has pointed out by now, one should use discount rates that reflect the risk and timing uncertainty of the liabilities of the pension fund.Unfortunately, this data is not publicly available but in the paper the researchers made an effort to estimate the true funding ratio of the public pension funds in their sample. And the results are disastrous. The average funding ratio is more likely around 40% than 70%! Estimated actuarial funding ratios of public pension funds in the USSource: Lu et al. (2019).In most countries, private pension funds with such massive underfunding would be forced to either restructure or close. Yet, thanks to some simple accounting tricks, the true level of underfunding has been covered up for years. One of the tricks to use to keep funding ratios high is to keep expected returns for risky assets, such as equities high because that will allow the pension fund to discount liabilities at a higher discount rate. And despite a ten-year equity bull market and steadily declining Treasury yields, the expected returns of public pension funds remain stable at 8% per year. Every investor knows that expected returns vary over time, depending on the valuation of the assets today. But public pension funds seem to be oblivious of that fact.Of course, they arenxe2x80x99t. They know full well that their expected returns are too high at the moment and that their true funding ratios are lower than their published numbers. But they canxe2x80x99t say that out loud because that would start a discussion about who is going to fund the gap. And in the case of public pension funds the answer to that question is very simple: itxe2x80x99s taxpayers. So instead of owning up to the problem, politicians and trustees of public pension plans rather kick the can down the road and assume unrealistically high expected returns and discount rates for liabilities. And to achieve these high returns, they have to reach for yield, particularly in the fixed income space where current yields are extremely low. No wonder, bank loans, high yield and private debt are so popular with pension funds these daysxe2x80xa6Expected returns of public pension funds in the USSource: Lu et al.

I get that no one really needs to use straws but if you think you can save the planet by abolishing plastic straws, you are sadly mistaken. All the plastic straws in the world make up just 0.025% of all the plastic that ends up in the ocean each year. By not using straws, we arenxe2x80x99t even beginning to make a dent in our environmental path of destruction. In fact, I will show in a future blog post that small acts of environmental-friendly behaviour provide us with moral credits that lead to less environmental-friendly behaviour in other areas and to lower investments in ESG assets. And the ability to help save the environment with ESG investments and impact investments is multitudes greater than by saving on plastic straws.That is not to say that I am against reducing our consumption of plastics. In fact, plastic consumption is one of the major environmental damages we humans cause because plastics never degrade and pollute the environment forever. And the amount of plastic we recycle is minimal. Plastics have been around since the beginning of the 20th century but became ubiquitous only after the Second World War. Since 1950, an estimated 8,300 million tonnes of plastics have been produced out of which 2,500 million tonnes are still in use. But only 600 million tonnes have been recycled, and out of these, only about 10% have been recycled more than once. True, we are changing our habits with regards to plastics, but in 2014 only about 30% of plastics used in Europe were recycled, 25% in China and a tiny 9% in the US. We still have a long way to go. Total plastics production since 1950Source: Geyer et al. (2017).But have you ever wondered how our society became a throwaway society? If you go back to before the Second World War plastics were hardly used at all and almost all packaging was made out of paper or glass, from the milk bottles that got filled up by your milkman to the vegetable and fruit that your grocer handed you in a paper bag. Our society was predominantly a re-use and low waste society.As the fantastic podcast Throughline recounted in a recent episode, the plastics industry had to literally teach people to throw away plastic cups and plates as well as plastic wrapping. The arguments the plastics industry made in radio and TV spots as well as in magazine ads like the ones shown below were that single use plastics were more convenient, more hygienic and saved work. After all, the plastic cup was never used before and would never be used again.Advertisements teaching people to throw away plastic itemsSource: Tabitha Whiting, Medium.This was done mostly out of profit motives. After the war, the manufacturing industry got a massive boost from the rising demand for consumer and capital goods. The plastics industry looked like it would be left behind since back then the only use for plastics was for industrial purposes and construction. But they understood that if they could convince people that consumer goods could be made out of plastics and then thrown away after use, it would create an ever-growing source of demand for their products. So, they embarked on a massive lobby campaign to introduce wasteful plastics in every area of society. And they were successful. The share of plastics in solid waste rose from less than 1% in 1960 to more than 10% in 2005 in developed countries. And because solid waste grows pretty much in line with real GDP, this also means that the growth of the plastics industry was a multiple of GDP growth over the last fifty-plus years. Is it surprising that the plastics industry is keen on getting us side-tracked into recycling plastic straws while continuing to produce harmful packaging material and plastic consumer goods?

Nir is a motivational speaker and talks a lot about how to form healthy habits in life. But in this article, he describes how he was challenged by an overweight lady in his audience that her problem is not forming new habits but breaking existing habits that are bad for her. Luckily, I am not obese (though I am overweight), but as I have said on Wednesday in my post on rule eight of The Virtuous Investor, I am a chocaholic. And trying to reduce my sugar consumption in life has been impossible for me.It is the same issue that obese people have with overeating. We know it is bad for us, but we donxe2x80x99t know how to give it up. And no, public shaming does not work at all, as James Corden has so passionately explained in reaction to a rant by Bill Maher about fat people:What Nir Eyal recommends in order to overcome bad habits is what he calls progressive extremism. He recommends starting with a small thing that you can easily give up in life. For example, in my case, I could give up cookies. While I love chocolate, cutting out cookies wonxe2x80x99t be too difficult for me because they are not very close to the top of my list of chocolatey things to eat. Then, he suggests, writing down your decision to cut out cookies from your diet for good in order to provide some subtle pressure on you to stick to this commitment. This sounds like great advice because writing something down is also a way to create discipline in your investment process as I have described in rule seven of The Virtuous Investor. Then comes the hard part (at least, I think this is going to be the hard part for me). Be patient. Try to stick to this rule for several weeks and review your commitment regularly (Eyal recommends every six weeks). I am a naturally impatient person so sticking to some rule, even if it is a simple rule that is easy to follow for weeks on end without seeing any changes is going to be hard for me. I am likely tempted to avoid cookies for a week, then think I have mastered this step and move on to the next thing to cut out of my diet. The problem is, if you move too fast, you tend to overwhelm yourself with too many things to avoid and it becomes frustrating. I think the trick with Eyalxe2x80x99s progressive extremism lies in doing it one small step at a time and not escalating too quickly. Once you have lived for several weeks without the old habit (e.g. eating cookies), you can pat yourself on the shoulder and move on to the next habit you want to overcome.It is arguably a slow process, but I will give it a try because it seems like it is much easier to master this technique than to go cold turkey with bad habits as I have done so often in the past xe2x80x93 and failed. But before I do so, I will probably buy Eyalxe2x80x99s book to get some more insights into his technique.Progressive extremismSource: Based on Nir Eyal.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"I like progressive extremism - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/i-like-progressive-extremism"}

The survey is worth looking at because, well, it comes around only every three years.What I find interesting about the survey is to look at the rise of the Chinese Renminbi (CNY) as a global currency. There are a lot of people out there who think that with the rise of China the US Dollar may lose its status as the worldxe2x80x99s reserve currency to the Renminbi. One necessary condition to become a major reserve currency is to have a deep and liquid market. And indeed, the average daily transaction volume in the Renminbi is growing at breakneck speed. Since 2010, the trading volume in Renminbi has grown by about 26% per year on average. Compare that to the 6% average growth rate in US Dollar transactions and you understand that the Renminbi is catching up fast.Average daily trading volume of Chinese RenminbiSource: BIS.Today, the average daily transaction volume in the USD/CNY is $269 billion. That is almost as much as the $287 billion in the USD/CAD and quite a bit more than the volume in the USD/CHF.But before you get too worried about the rise of the Renminbi to world dominance, it is necessary to put these numbers into perspective. And that is where the but comes in. The share of the Renminbi in the global currency markets is a mere 4.3% today. Compare this to the 88.3% market share of the US Dollar and you understand that we are a long way from the Renminbi becoming a serious contender for global reserve currency. At the moment, the Renminbi is the most traded emerging market currency in the world but still only the eighth most traded currency overall, quite a bit behind the Swiss Franc and the Canadian Dollar. Thus, arguing that the Renminbi could become the worldxe2x80x99s reserve currency is like arguing that the Loonie or the Swiss Franc could become the worldxe2x80x99s reserve currency. Itxe2x80x99s a bit premature.Global market share by currencySource: BIS.But of course, transaction volumes in the Renminbi grow much faster than in the US Dollar. If we extrapolate the average growth rate of the last ten years into the future, then the Renminbi would overtake the US Dollar in 2037 or so. But even that might be an optimistic assumption because as with every new market, growth rates slow down as the market matures and base volumes increase. If we assume that the US Dollar and the Renminbi grow at the same pace as in the last three years, the Renminbi would overtake the US Dollar only in 2050 or so. Thatxe2x80x99s about the time when the Renminbi can become a serious contender for global reserve currency. But that does not mean it will automatically become the global reserve currency. There are significant political hurdles to overcome. The US economy was much larger than the British economy and the US Dollar as prominent in global currency markets as Sterling for many decades before the US Dollar replaced Sterling as the global reserve currency.

It is a very great token a man to be reject from the mercy of God when he is vexed with no temptations.xe2x80x9dErasmus of RotterdamHi, my name is Joachim and I am a chocaholic. I admit to living a good life most of the times. I donxe2x80x99t smoke, I almost never drink, and I eat less and less meat. Yet, I am addicted to chocolate. To be more precise, I prefer Swiss chocolate, which is just better than Belgian chocolate (apologies to my Belgian friends). In case you ever want to buy me a present, I prefer chocolate from Lxc3xa4derach and Sprxc3xbcngli. I cannot live without chocolate or at least my daily dose of sugar (if there is no decent chocolate, a soda will do). I know this increases my risk of diabetes and obesity and shortens my life expectancy, but then again, what is a life worth that has no joy in it? I try to be good and healthy most of the times, but often, I cannot resist the temptation of chocolate.And the same is true for my investments. I have a portfolio that is geared towards achieving my individual goals and follows a long-term investment plan. Yet, I am constantly tempted to deviate from this long-term portfolio and become a sinner:I have a tendency to invest in short-term opportunities, even though I know that trading is hazardous to my wealth.I am tempted to invest based on a good story (e.g. technology is going to revolutionize the world) instead of looking at data.I am tempted to invest my portfolio in companies I think I know, which introduces would introduce a home bias into my portfolio.The temptations of investing are manifold, and it is all too easy to give in to these temptations. In fact, most people do give in to them as the chart below shows for the case of home bias in equity portfolios around the world. Home bias around the worldSource: Faruqee et al. (2004).As Erasmus of Rotterdam wrote, temptations are nothing to worry about. They are a part of life and we all have to deal with them. And there are two main ways to deal with them. First, one can become an investor monk who stays away from all temptation and devoutly follows only the long-term plan. As I have written in the first rule of the Virtuous Investor, this is clearly the best way to maximise investment success. But honestly, who is disciplined enough to stick to a long-term investment plan for decades?Let me rephrase that. Who is disciplined enough to stick to a long-term investment plan for decades and is not German?Unless you have super-human levels of self-discipline like the Germans, it is unlikely that you will be able to withstand temptation all the time. You will give in and that is fine. The problem only starts, as Erasmus said, when you feel you have no temptations. That is when you have given in to them and you can no longer differentiate between what is good for your investments in the long run and what makes you feel good. The outcome is likely going to be disastrous because many of these temptations cost a lot of performance. Below is a famous chart from the seminal study by Barber and Odean on trading behaviour and its impact on investment returns before and after costs. The more investors trade, the lower their returns after fees.Trading is hazardous to your wealthSource: Barber and Odean (2000).But there must be a middle ground between becoming an investor monk and giving in to all the temptations of the investment world. What I would suggest is to make room for the temptations in your portfolio and ringfence them, so they cannot negatively impact your long-term portfolio.One way to do this is to invest 90% or 95% or your savings in your long-term investment portfolio. Then, you go and open another account with a discount brokerage. This will be your investment playground. With 5% to 10% of your savings you can invest to your heartxe2x80x99s delight and buy all the things that sound great and make you feel smart as an investor. The first rule for this playground is that you are not allowed to move money from the long-term portfolio into the playground. If you run out of money in your playground thatxe2x80x99s it. No more playing with the other children. The second rule for this playground is that you are not allowed to enter into debt. This means no naked short options, no Lombard loans on your portfolio and no investments that require additional injections of capital in the future that is not covered by money in the playground portfolio. These two rules are designed to ringfence your long-term portfolio from any mistakes you might make in the playground portfolio. Ideally, you also record all your investments in an investment diary as I have proposed in rule seven last week so that you can review your investment decisions and the temptations you have succumbed to. Over time, you may find that these temptations become so unpalatable that you avoid them altogether. Though, I wouldnxe2x80x99t be so sure of that. No matter how much bad chocolate like Hersheyxe2x80x99s Kisses I eat in my life, I seem to be unable to ween myself off of chocolatexe2x80xa6For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The Virtuous Investor: Rule 8 - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-virtuous-investor-rule-8"}

Itxe2x80x99s like working in IT. If things go wrong, everyone comes and blames you but if things go well, nobody comes and says thank you.A main feature of investing is that you cannot try out new ideas in a laboratory and perfect them there until they are ready for the real world. You have to try investment ideas in the real world. This also means that things not only can but will go wrong. The job of an investor is to protect the portfolio from unwanted or excessive losses.The problem is that managing risks and protecting a portfolio comes at a cost. If you hedge a portfolio with derivatives, costs will be incurred. If you reduce risk with lower risk investments, you typically face lower returns. And if you diversify risks properly, you will end up with investments that perform worse than your original investment (if you donxe2x80x99t, chances are your xe2x80x9cdiversifiedxe2x80x9d will not protect you when markets turn sour).All of this seems obvious in theory, but the problem is that if you protect against risks and the risks never materialize, you are left with lower performance.Assume you expect a recession to hit the US in 2020. What can you do? You can reduce your stock holdings and replace cyclical stocks with defensive stocks. Or you can shift from stocks into bonds. Or you use options and futures to hedge your equity exposure, etc.If the recession materializes and stock markets tank you feel pretty good about yourself and your decision to reduce risks. But what if the recession never comes and the bull market continues?Over the last decade, many people have predicted a recession in the US that never came:In the summer of 2011 Europe was in the midst of a debt crisis and the US was at the brink of defaulting in its debt over a debt ceiling standoff in Congress. Stock markets corrected but recovered quickly again.In late 2015, oil prices tanked in the midst of a supply glut and a Chinese growth slowdown, yet the US economy and the bull market in stocks continued with few setbacks.In 2016, Donald Trump was elected President and some people expected an imminent recession. Yet, once again, nothing happened.Every time it would have been rational to protect your portfolio against market setbacks and every time, the investor would have looked stupid in the aftermath.But nobody ever asks the xe2x80x9cwhat ifxe2x80x9d question. What looks like unnecessary defensiveness might have turned out to be the right thing to do if the world had taken a different turn. People that are today celebrated as investment heroes because they had stayed invested in risky assets all the time would have been criticized as reckless, while people who are derided as too cautious or bearishmight be the stars of today.Take the case of GMO. For years, the company has warned of high valuations and the possibility of a market bubble that may burst at any time. As a result, the portfolios of the firm were probably more defensively positioned than other asset managers and their performance was weaker than their competitorsxe2x80x99. Does that make them worse asset managers? Well, they warned of overvalued markets in the late 1990s and turned out to be right (though about two to three years early). In the early 2000s, after the tech bubble burst, GMO was hailed as the firm that saw it all coming. Had the bull market of the late 1990s continued a few more years or the current bull market ended a little bit earlier, the public perception of GMO would have been 180 degrees different. The same portfolio and the same asset manager but a vastly different public assessment of their skill. If you criticize GMO for their caution today, you ignore the counterfactual. If you praised them for their caution in the early 2000s, you did the same.The longer a bull or bear market lasts, the more impotent the counterfactual becomes because more and more people who bet on a reversal of the markets (either from bull to bear or from bear to bull) look stupid and will be derided by other investors as people who donxe2x80x99t understand this market. Of course, the counterfactual is not less likely ex ante than the actual outcome. And investors need to position their portfolios before an event, not with the benefit of hindsight. Thus, the most dangerous thing we can do today - after a bull market in equities that lasted more than ten years - is to ignore the counterfactual and focus on just one scenario. Whether you are bearish or bullish, the most important question to ask is: xe2x80x9cWhat if I am wrong?xe2x80x9d How would you position your portfolio then? And if the answer is vastly different from your current portfolio, what makes you so sure you are right? As Robin De Niro says in the movie Ronin:xe2x80x9cWhenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt.xe2x80x9dAnd if there is a reasonable doubt about your expectation for the future then it is better to stay away from extreme positions, be they extremely bullish or extremely bearish. Today is not the time to be all in on equities nor is it time to sell all your equities. In fact, it is never time to be all in on equities or to sell all your equities because the future is never certain. And neither you nor your portfolio should ever be certain about the future either.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The impotence of the counterfactual - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-impotence-of-the-counterfactual"}

The UN even went as far as banning any speaker from the dais who did not come up with a concrete proposal and commitment to fight climate change. No wonder the climate summit only lasted for one day. But letxe2x80x99s not focus on the fact that I would advocate for this restriction on speakers to be applied in every Parliament in every country.The dissatisfaction of the public with their leaders when it comes to fight climate change is palpable everywhere. In Germany, the current government managed to come up with a climate action plan recently that was so weak and noncommittal that it created a fire storm of criticism from all sides of the political spectrum (except the Alternative fxc3xbcr Deutschland, the sole party in Germany that denies climate change).Gallup then published the results of a global survey on how satisfied people are in general with the actions taken to fight climate change. The chart below shows that in countries like Germany, the UK or Ireland, less than 40% of people are dissatisfied with climate action. But these are countries that are at the forefront of the fight against climate change. In these countries, climate change is a major topic that is frequently discussed in the media and there is substantial public pressure on political and business leaders to fight climate change.In countries like the US, on the other hand, more than half the population is dissatisfied with the actions taken so far to combat climate change and in Brazil, this share is as high as two out of three people.Dissatisfaction with climate actionSource: Gallup.In the US, this dissatisfaction with politicians can easily be traced to the election of Donald Trump as President. Under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama about 60% of the American public was satisfied with the actions taken to fight climate change. With the election of Donald Trump, this share immediately dropped below 50% and has remained there ever since.According to the Yale Prgram on Climate Communication, 60% of Americans think that the President should do more to address global warming. What is astonishing is that in these polarized times, practically every county in the US shows a majority of people who think the President needs to step up (yellow- and orange-coloured counties in the chart below). Even in deep red states like West Virginia and Kentucky that have a major coal industry, a majority of citizens thinks the President needs to do more to address global warming.Share of Americans who think the President should do more to address global warmingSource: Yale Program on Climate Change CommunicationBut as I went through the results of the Yale Program on Climate Change, I noticed one really surprising result. Apparently, 70% of the population in the US thinks that environmental protection is more important than economic growth. This is astonishing, since the US is the one country in the world where economic growth is like a fetish. Absolutely everything has to be done to maximise growth, no matter the long-term consequences. If we look at the chart below, we again see a clear nationwide consensus in favour of environmental protection. Cynics may argue that people only prefer environmental protection over economic growth as long as they have a job, but the overall majority is so large, that it is hard to argue that people are ignorant about potential trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection. About twice as many people give preference for environmental protection over economic growth than the other way around. In my view, politicians should take heed of these results and businesses who think they can continue with business as usual should be aware that there is a massive public backlash waiting for them the moment they pollute the environment and this is picked up in the media.Share of Americans who think environmental protection is more important than economic growthSource: Yale Program on Climate Change CommunicationFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"People arenât happy about climate action - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/people-arent-happy-about-climate"}

Because it works. And to be honest, the only reason why I added these pictures to this post is so you have something to enjoy in this articlexe2x80xa6Now take a look at the CFO in your company. If you did not know him, would you trust him? If so, there is good news: your business is probably saving a lot of money on audit fees.Tien-Shih Hsieh from the University of Massachusetts and his colleagues used facial recognition software to look at the pictures of 1,179 CEOs and 1,360 CFOs of 845 listed companies in the US. The CEOs and CFOs were in charge between 2001 and 2014.In a first step, the researchers used images of the CEOs and CFOs taken from the internet and measured distinctive facial features that are traditionally linked with trustworthiness. In particular, they measured the angle of the eyebrows, the shape of the face and the width of the chin. Previous studies have shown that people with rounder faces, wider chins and more arched eyebrows are generally perceived to be more trustworthy. In contrast, people with narrow chins, elongated faces and flat eyebrows are considered to be less trustworthy by the public. The researchers could replicate these findings with their set of pictures of CEOs and CFOs which allowed them to look at the relationship between facial trustworthiness of executives and the audit fees the companies paid. It turns out that audit firms offer a significant fee discount for CFOs that look more trustworthy but not for CEOs. The effect is particularly strong when a new audit firm is hired, and the two parties do not know each other that well. Holding other things such as company profitability, credit risks etc. equal, a CFO with a face in the top quartile of trustworthiness gets a 5.6% discount in audit fees. That may not sound like much but given the average annual audit fee in their sample of $4.3m, this discount is worth $242,000. The median audit fee is lower at $2.25m, but even then the discount is worth $126,000.Over time, the discount granted by audit firms narrows, but it takes many years for fees to approach the levels of audit fees for firms with CFOs that donxe2x80x99t look trustworthy. Over 15 years, a xe2x80x9ctop quartilexe2x80x9d CFO can save the company $108,000 per year in audit fees. So next time your CFO quits, you might want to hire someone with a trustworthy face and then change auditors. This way, your new CFO practically pays for himselfxe2x80xa6CFO facial trustworthiness, audit fees and audit tenureSource: Hsieh et al. (2019).

Part of the argument was the seasonally weak demand for gold from China and other countries. And indeed, since the report was published, gold prices have declined by up to 2.7% in a volatile downward trend. However, since the beginning of May as trade fears started to dominate financial markets again, the picture has slowly shifted. Unlike last year, when hostile trade rhetoric led to a strong appreciation of the US Dollar and hurt Asian markets more than US markets, this time, the lift to US assets seems much more muted. In 2017, the Bloomberg Dollar Index rose 3.1% after Donald Trump introduced import tariffs on solar panels and other goods. In 2018, the introduction of steel tariffs led to an appreciation of the US Dollar by 6.5% in two months. And in 2019? Since the beginning of April, the Bloomberg Dollar Index rose a mere 0.8%. Looking at the chart, you would be hard pressed to find the time when the US-China trade talks broke down or when Donald Trump announced tariffs on Mexican imports. On the other hand, classical safe haven assets like Treasuries have come back into fashion. In 2018, 10-year Treasury yields did not react to the steel tariffs at all as the US economy was still benefitting from the sugar rush of the US tax cuts earlier in the year. This year, this fiscal stimulus has faded and while economic growth is holding up nicely in the US so far, the risks of an economic slowdown are increasing. Correspondingly, 10-year US Treasury yields have declined sharply from 2.59% in mid-April to 2.16% today. About half of that 43bps decline in yields has been due to declining inflation expectations, while the other half has been due to declining real yields. In other words, we are witnessing the classic shift in expectations that comes with rising recession fears. Inflation expectations, as well as real rates, are declining. What is different this time, though it makes sense if one assumes that the US economy is likely to slow down faster than the economy in Europe or Asia, as we have argued in our recent Market Outlook , is that the US Dollar is not strengthening that much. One major beneficiary of these developments should be gold. Not only does gold head into a period of seasonally strong demand at this time of year, but the relatively stable US Dollar, together with declining bond yields, should provide support to the precious metal. If Donald Trump follows through with his trade war with Mexico, he is effectively opening a second front, besides the conflict with China, which is likely to hurt the US economy at least as much, if not more, than the tariffs on Chinese imports. This should give additional support to gold in coming months. History teaches us that fighting a war on two fronts at the same time is never a good idea. In this case, the loser could be global stock markets while the winner could be gold.Gold seasonalitySource: Bloomberg.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Market sentiment is shifting and that may favour gold - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/market-sentiment-is-shifting-and"}

The stress induced by social media and all kinds of technology is tremendous. According to Virgin, six out of ten people feel stressed by technology. The range of symptoms reaches from sleep deprivation and lower quality of sleep to anxiety and depression.This experience has triggered an entire cottage industry of digital detox providers and a National Day of Unplugging held every year on 1 March. These are all good ideas and they really help reduce stress, but they can also be used to reduce stress in general.Years ago, my wife and I introduced xe2x80x9cgadget-free Sundaysxe2x80x9d. Because we were both very stressed at our jobs (not just from the use of technology but due to other factors as well), so we decided that every Sunday we would shut down our smartphones and abstain from using the internet, TV, email, phones or any other form of electronic media. Before we started the experiment, I was concerned I would be bored all day (I do get bored easilyxe2x80xa6) and that a gadget-free Sunday would turn out to be a rather stressful day. I could not have been more wrong. The Sundays without TV and the internet turned out to be like mini holidays. The house was quiet and we could both relax, talk to each other and when the weather was nice, just enjoy nature. It turned out to be the best recipe to charge our batteries in a short amount of time and I still recommend gadget-free Sundays to everyone who has had a stressful week.We have since expanded the concept to our vacations. We found that one of the best ways to have a relaxing vacation is to go to a car-free island or village. The mere absence of cars slows down the pace of life so much that it creates an incredibly relaxing effect on the people who live there and the tourists who visit. The list of car-free or practically car-free places in the world is quite long, by the way. We have been to places like La Digue in the Seychelles and Zermatt in Switzerland, but I hear Lamu Island in Kenya and Hydra in Greece are also very nice. Over time, we have upped the ante and try to rent places in a car-free surrounding (or at least an area with very few cars) that comes with a dog, but the secret of how to do that will not be revealed.

Ride sharing company Lyft launched on 28 March 2019 and saw its share price decline 17% within the first month of trading. Its bigger rival Uber fared even worse, debuting on 9 May 2019 and declining 17.6% in the first three days of trading. Since then, the stock has recovered somewhat, but it is still significantly below its IPO price. On the other hand, foodtech company Beyond Meat launched on 1 May 2019 and tripled its share price in the first three days of trading.None of these companies are profitable at the moment and analysts donxe2x80x99t expect them to become profitable in the next couple of years. This, in turn, has created a lot of media attention and comparisons with the IPO boom of the late 1990s. So, I went to the website of IPO guru Jay Ritter and checked the recent market conditions. Our chart shows the number of tech and biotech IPOs since 1980 as well as the share of companies that were unprofitable at IPO. The good news is that while 2018 saw the second largest number of tech and biotech IPOs since 2000, the sheer number of IPOs remains very low by historical standards. There are other healthy signs as well. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, the average age of a company at IPO dropped to just four years in 1999, while today it is 12 years. Thus, companies cannot just run to the stock exchange anymore with a largely unproven business model to cash in on initial strong growth. Tech companies looking for an IPO today must have a much longer track record in order to attract investors. Furthermore, the average price-to-sales ratio of tech IPOs in 2018 was 7.6, above the long-term average since 1980 but still well below the excesses of the late 1990s.Given these lower valuations, it is not surprising that the long-term performance of recent IPOs compares quite well with historic averages. Jay Ritter does not separate long-term performance of newly-listed companies by sector, so we have to use his statistics for all IPOs in the US, not just tech and biotech IPOs. The return of newly listed companies since 1980 in the first three years was on average 17.9% below the market return. However, the companies that had an IPO in 2016 managed to beat market returns by 15.2% in the three years since their IPO. In general, between 2000 and 2016, newly-listed companies managed to have the same return in the first three years after listing as the overall stock market, which is quite a good track record, in my view.But in the tenth year of a stock market boom, one should expect IPO standards to erode somewhat and this is indeed what we have seen. The share of newly-listed companies in the tech and biotech sector that are profitable is now at the lowest level since the measurements began in 1980. Only 6% of the tech and biotech IPOs of 2018 were profitable at the time of listing. So far, this has not led to lower performance over the long run as the three-year returns shown above indicate, but it is unclear how far the shares of unprofitable companies will fall in a bear market, whenever it comes. More worryingly to me, however, is the rise in IPOs with dual share classes. Both in 2017 and 2018, 13 tech IPOs had dual share classes giving different voting rights to the different share classes. As a share of the total number of IPOs in the tech sector, this is the highest share ever recorded and indicates a worrying trend that tech entrepreneurs and VC companies are increasingly trying to raise capital without handing over control to outside shareholders. The result is a rising number of newly-listed tech companies that have little incentive to act in the best interest of public shareholders, and that is something that might lead to disastrous results for individual companies. The current IPO boom in perspectiveSource: Jay Ritter, Fidante Capital.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Putting the IPO boom into perspective - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/putting-the-ipo-boom-into-perspective"}

This makes sense if one understands that the valuation of their shares is calculated off the amount of proven reserves an energy company owns. And despite the push for climate action, most fossil fuel producers show no intention of cutting back on their exploration and development of new fields. According to Rystad UCube, capital expenditures (Capex) of oil and gas producers are expected to rise by 85% over the coming decade and will eventually reach more than $1tn per year. Much of the exploration and development will take place in areas that have not been developed so far, such as Guyana.The problem is that the production from the existing oil fields is already likely to push global CO2 levels beyond the levels that will warm the climate by more than 1.5xe2x81xb0C. In other words, if we are successful in stopping climate change, the existing reserves of oil and gas companies will become partly stranded and have to remain in the ground forever, causing a decline in the valuation of these companies. Now look at the chart below from Global Witness , based on Rystad data. Over the coming decade, Exxon alone is scheduled to invest $167bn in oil and gas exploration and development. That is half the market cap of the company. If the world manages to achieve the climate goals set in Paris in 2015, these investments would all become worthless. Thus, Exxon faces a share price decline in excess of 50% if the fight against climate change is successful.

The approaches to factor investing and smart beta are manifold, and this free book provides a good overview over the most common approaches and how to include them in the asset allocation of a portfolio. As a quantitative oriented investor, I am a fan of smart beta and factor approaches to investing because they impose discipline and an evidence-based approach to investments.Thanks to a series of Hedge Fund Research (HFR) indices across different asset classes, these approaches to factor investing can now be tracked on a monthly basis and we can identify unexpected developments relatively quickly. And currently, something unusual is happening in the factor space. No factor works all the time so periods of underperformance or negative performance in factor approaches are to be expected. But there are some factor pairs that tend to have negative correlation with each other. For example, momentum factors tend to work when value factors donxe2x80x99t and vice versa. It is rare that momentum and value work at the same time. In the past, I have managed large cap equity portfolios and I used a factor-based approach focusing on value and quality to identify attractive investment opportunities. This was particularly helpful during the Eurozone debt crisis of 2011 and 2012, when the quality factor helped us avoid value traps in the Eurozone.However xe2x80x93 and this is something I cannot explain but only observe xe2x80x93 in 2019, almost all factors seem to have stopped working. Our chart shows some of the most prominent factors used in the equity space. The smart beta index, which combines different alternative weighting schemes like equal weighted indices, minimum variance indices and risk parity approaches, has declined since early 2018 and is down 5.4% in the first three months of 2019 after declining 13.9% in 2018. Value and high dividend stocks have been struggling since late 2017 as well, and while in the first half of 2018, momentum performed well, this factor has seen negative returns since summer 2018 as well. Small cap and quality stocks have been underperforming for much of the last three years anyway, but their underperformance seems to have continued in recent months as well, after briefly stabilising in late 2018.In short, we live in an environment where all the stocks that traditionally should be underperforming are amongst the best performing stocks.

While some readers agreed with me, it seems I may have hit a nerve with the younger generation, some of which complained to me that social media and modern technology are socially useful inventions. And my reaction to that is that some of these inventions may indeed be useful, but others may be as socially useful as the invention of cigarettes. And a recent study on the usage of Facebook shows what I mean.Hunt Allcott and his colleagues from Stanford University and New York University managed to recruit c. 2,700 Americans in late 2018 and asked a random sample of them to deactivate Facebook for several weeks in the runup and immediate aftermath of the Midterm Elections on 7 November 2018. They then measured the changes in behaviour of the participants who deactivated Facebook and compared it to the participants who did not. The researchers focused on three important areas: subjective wellbeing, political engagement and how participants used their time after they deactivated Facebook.The political dimension is not my focus today, but I want to mention that participants who deactivated Facebook became less knowledgeable about the current political news but also less polarized in their views. Both Republican and Democratic voters moved their opinions more to the centre of the political spectrum and the effect of xe2x80x9cde-polarisationxe2x80x9d in their political views was almost half of the increase in political polarisation observed in American politics between 1996 and 2016. Thus, the study indicates once more that Facebook may play a role in the increasing polarisation of the political landscape.However, what interests me more is how people who deactivated Facebook use their \"free\" time and how they feel after deactivating Facebook. On average, the people participating in the study spent one hour per day on Facebook beforehand. After deactivating it, the time gained was used by all kinds of activities ranging from watching TV to meeting friends and family in person. One of the biggest increases in time spent was to go out for dinner with friends, apparently. And we know from previous studies that spending time with family and friends is the best way to improve wellbeing.Thus, it should come as no surprise that the increase in life satisfaction and happiness of those people who deactivated Facebook was significant (see our chart below). Similarly, people felt less depressed and less anxious. Feelings of loneliness and boredom also declined but these effects were not statistically significant.In other words: Facebook does reduce subjective wellbeing and getting off Facebook has a positive effect on wellbeing and happiness, which in turn has long-term health benefits. As one participant wrote:xe2x80x9cI was way less stressed. I wasn't attached to my phone as much as I was before. And I found I didn't really care so much about things that were happening [online] because I was more focused on my own life... I felt more content. I think I was in a better mood generally. I thought I would miss seeing everyone's day-to-day activities... I really didn't miss it at all.xe2x80x9dYet, the authors of the study also concluded that Facebook provides significant benefits to consumers. They conclude that this is the case because they asked the participants in their study to value the use of Facebook in monetary terms. They asked how much they would be willing to pay to re-activate Facebook and the answer was an astonishing $100 for four weeks of access to Facebook. And whatxe2x80x99s more, this number did not decline after four weeks of xe2x80x9cgoing cold turkeyxe2x80x9d on Facebook.The authors claim that this result shows that Facebook has significant positive value for users, but I think this is a misinterpretation of the results. People are willing to pay enormous amounts of money to buy cigarettes, vaping devices and other forms of legal drugs even though study after study shows that wellbeing increases if they give up smoking. In this sense, the results show to me that Facebook is like a tobacco company selling unhealthy goods and services to consumers and exploiting their addiction. And while people who stop smoking have a certain resilience to taking up smoking again, once they have abstained for a few months, it seems that the addictive effects of Facebook may last longer than the ones of cigarettes. That may simply be because by now so many people are on Facebook that it has become a significant part of almost everybodyxe2x80x99s life, so that missing out on Facebook creates some kind of permanent state of withdrawal. But as the study shows, the price for missing out on Facebook is increased happiness and life satisfaction. Not the worst trade-off.Change in wellbeing after turning off FacebookSource: Allcott et al. (2019).Note: Negative feelings are multiplied by -1 so that points to the right of the red line indicate improvement of wellbeing and points to the left indicate deterioration of wellbeing.

I have shown that based on this methodology, it seems much more likely that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will just be a fad rather than the oft-hyped replacement of fiat currencies. It also allows us to state that Microsoft and IBM will likely still be around long after nobody remembers Facebook anymore.The Copernican Principle becomes even more fascinating if we apply it to social concepts like capitalism or socialism. Capitalism can be traced back to at least 16th century Britain, if not further. For the sake of argument, letxe2x80x99s take the foundation of the first stock company, the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) in 1606, as the symbolic starting point of modern capitalism. Then capitalism, with its structure of shared ownership of the means of production by owners of capital, is roughly 400 years old. Socialism, on the other hand, can be traced back a long time too, but a commonly accepted starting point can be found in the publication of Marx and Engelxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cDas Kapitalxe2x80x9d in 1867. Thus, socialism as a potential form of governance is about 150 years old. The Copernican Principle allows us to estimate that with a 95% probability, capitalism will still exist in this world 10 years from now and up to another 15,600 years, while socialism will exist at least for another four years and up to 5,850 years into the future.So, to all my socialist friends I will say that your dream of abolishing capitalism is unlikely to happen any time soon and to my capitalist friends I will say that you will likely be challenged by socialists for centuries if not millennia to come. Now, you might say these calculations are ridiculous, but I dare you to come up with a better guess that is grounded in sound logic and does not rely on hypothesis and projections of the future that may or may not be proven right. The political pendulum constantly swings between left and right. In the 1950s, the pendulum was right of centre, but then swung to the left in the late 1960s and during the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s it swung right again until the advent of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). In the aftermath of the GFC, left-wing politicians seemed to have had the upper hand before right-wing populists gained popularity. Today, we see a resurrection of the left in reaction to the rise of right-wing populism. And so, the world continues in a constant struggle between the ideas of the right and the left.Now letxe2x80x99s get even more audacious and try to predict the future of the human race. Humans in their current form as homo sapiens have wandered the earth for about 350,000 years. Using the Copernican Principle, we can estimate a 95% confidence interval for the extinction of humans on Earth and end up with an estimate of 8,974 years to 13.65 million years from today. This means that the religious fanatics who try to convince you that the end of the world is near are probably wrong xe2x80x93 but I guess you knew that already. More importantly, the Copernican Principle allows us to state that humans are likely to be around long after capitalism and socialism have been replaced by some other form of social governance. More troubling, though, the Copernican Principle states that humans will outlive democracy and eventually replace it by some other form of political rule.Thus, even though the Copernican Principle starts with the assumption that we are not living in a special moment in time, it leads us to conclude that in some way, our times are special because they are dominated xe2x80x93 at least in the West xe2x80x93 by democracy and a high degree of individual freedom and prosperity. The Copernican Principle tells us that these circumstances will not last forever and that humans will xe2x80x9coutlivexe2x80x9d these periods eventually. Luckily, it seems that we will have a couple of millennia before that happens.Of course, I cannot end on this rather hopeful note. Because while the Copernican Principle is applicable to situations that are driven by social interactions, there is one prominent area where the Copernican Principle is not applicable: science. Because the laws of nature are fixed and rather deterministic (at least once you are human or anything else bigger than an atom or a molecule) predictions about future developments in nature can be made with a much higher degree of accuracy than the Copernican Principle allows. And science tells us that climate change will make life on Earth much less comfortable in the coming decades. Science also tells us that the idea of leaving Earth and colonising Mars, let alone another planet outside our solar system is completely ridiculous and a waste of time and resources. Science also tells us that we are not alone in the universe but that other life forms exist. But it also tells us that it is extremely unlikely that we will ever meet them or make contact. And finally, science tells us that the sun will eventually run out of fuel and expand into a red giant star. The good news is that the sun will not swallow Earth as it expands, because our planet is too far away from it. The bad news is that the expansion of the sun will pull our planet out of its orbit, so that it will spiral into the sun and burn. And that will be the end of life on Earth and in the solar system in general.PS: Donxe2x80x99t worry. I am not depressed, and I am not going to jump off a bridge anytime soon.

Cryptocurrencies are going to replace fiat currencies and capitalism is coming to an end within a generation. What lucky coincidence it is that it is us who happen to live at the exact time when cryptocurrencies end the reign of fiat currencies as store of value, or when capitalism finally gets replaced by socialism, or some other guiding principle to create well-being! In fact, this line of argument turns us and the times we live in into a very special moment in time - however it is more likely that we live in just some random epoch that seems special to us because we are in it, but in fact is not special at all.Prof. Richard Gott of Princeton University was to my knowledge the first to analyse this kind of flawed thinking in an article in Nature. During a trip through Europe as a young man in 1969 he stopped at the Berlin Wall and was musing whether he would see the Wall come down during his lifetime. Was the probability of the Berlin Wall coming down higher or lower than the probability of Stonehenge being destroyed during his lifetime? Because he did not think that him visiting the Berlin Wall happened at any special time, he thought it is very unlikely that he would be visiting the Wall the day before it came down. Similarly, it was highly unlikely that the Wall would stand many hundreds of years in the future because that meant he would visit the Wall very close to the beginning of its lifetime. He thought, if he visited the Wall at some random point in time there would be a 75% chance that he would be visiting the Wall after a quarter of its total lifetime had passed, and a 75% chance he would be visiting the wall after three quarters of its lifetime had passed. At the time of his visit, the Wall was eight years old, so he calculated that there is a 50% probability the Wall would come down sometime between 1971 and 1993 (see chart below). Stonehenge, on the other hand, had been around for roughly 4,000 years, so he calculated that, with a 50% probability, Stonehenge would survive another 1,300 to 12,000 years from the day of his visit.Of course, history proved Gott right, but it also allowed him to develop a general theory that allows one to estimate the likelihood of future survival only by knowing how long something had been around. For example, the longer a show has been performed at the West End, the more likely it is that it will be performed for a long time into the future. Shows that have only recently started, on the other hand, have a high likelihood of being cancelled in the next few months. This is simply a reflection of the fact that very few shows are incredibly successful (e.g. The Lion King or Cats) while most shows are not popular enough to survive for many years.The same is true for economic phenomena like stores of value or different technologies. Certain exceptions notwithstanding, most technologies are replaced or xe2x80x9cdiexe2x80x9d very quickly. Do you remember the steam cars or electric cars of the early part of the twentieth century? Cars powered by internal combustion engines were more efficient and thus drove early electric and steam cars into extinction xe2x80x93 and the companies that built them with it. Similarly, hardly anyone today remembers MySpace, an early form of social networking, while everyone today thinks that Facebook will be with us forever.The approach of Richard Gott allows us to estimate the likely time a given company or technology will survive in the future. If our current moment in time is not in any way special (it could be, but it is unlikely) then Gottxe2x80x99s so-called xe2x80x9cCopernican Principlexe2x80x9d allows us to calculate a confidence band for the future survival. I stress that this estimate is based on complete ignorance about the driving forces behind a phenomenon and, as a result, the confidence intervals are very wide, but it nevertheless, provides a good first guess, because unlike the work of so many futurists, it is grounded in sound logic and maths. Letxe2x80x99s see how this works in practice.When it comes to stores of value, gold has been used as a store of value for at least 5,000 years, while fiat currencies have been around only since the end of the gold standard in the 1930s, i.e. about 90 years. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, on the other hand have been around for only about ten years. I wonxe2x80x99t bore you with the exact maths, but the Copernican Principle predicts that:Gold will remain a store of value sometime for at least another 128 years and up to 195,000 years (95% confidence interval).Fiat currencies will remain a store of value for at least the next two years and up to the next 3,510 years (95% confidence interval).Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will stop being accepted as a store of value sometime between the next three months and 390 years from today (95% confidence interval).In other words, it is highly unlikely that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will outlast fiat currencies and gold will likely still be accepted as a store of value long after fiat currencies have gone out of fashion. This does not mean that Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general will not replace gold and fiat currencies, but it is highly unlikely that they will and I, for one, would not bet my money on it.Similarly, we can look at the expected lifespan of technology companies.Facebook has been around for 15 years now and with a 95% probability will be around for at least another six months and up to another 585 years.Microsoft has been around for 40 years and with a 95% probability will still exist in one year and up to another 1,560 years.IBM has been around for more than 100 years and with a 95% probability will still exist in two years and up to 3,900 years.Note that this likelihood says nothing about the profitability of either company, it just states that because IBM has survived so many more technological changes than Microsoft, and Microsoft in turn has adapted to many more technological changes than Facebook, it is more likely that Microsoft will survive a technological change that can bring down Facebook And IBM will survive changes that could bring down Microsoft.How Gott estimated the remaining lifetime of the Berlin Wall in 1969Source: Desispeaks.comFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The Copernican Principle - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/the-copernican-principle"}

I thought that given the global economic slowdown, cyclical stocks would likely disappoint and post negative earnings growth, while defensive stocks would do better. With the earnings season in the US now practically over, it is instructive to look at the final tally.On average, earnings declined by 0.5% in the first quarter 2019 according to an analysis by FactSet, which was pretty much in line with what was expected by analysts going into the earnings season. For the second quarter 2019, analysts expect earnings to decline yet again, on average by 1.1% at the moment. But look beyond the headline number as our colleagues at FactSet have done and you will find some interesting developments. Rather than separating companies between cyclical and defensive sectors, they looked at the earnings growth of companies with more than 50% of sales outside the US vs. companies with more than 50% of sales in the US. The more domestically oriented companies in the US reported average earnings growth of 6.2%, thanks in large part to the strong US consumer. More internationally exposed companies, on the other hand, saw their earnings decline on average by 12.8%. These are predominantly cyclical companies in the IT and industrials sector that serve a global customer base.This big difference between domestic and global companies in the US reminds me of the situation in the late 1990s when the global economy slowed down well before the US economy did. This slowdown started in 1998 with the Asian crisis and then spilled over to Europe and other regions in 1999 before ending the US expansion and causing a recession there in 2000. Today, the US economy remains strong compared to other regions, but we are again witnessing a slowdown in China and Europe that is manifesting itself in US corporate earnings. If this economic slowdown in Europe continues, it could eventually end in a recession in the Eurozone that, together with the negative impact of the US-China trade war, could push the US into recession in 2020. Whether this will really come to pass is unclear at the moment, and it will be important to see if the European recovery of the first quarter continues in the second and how well China can cope with the US tariffs given the massive stimulus that is being employed this year.The international slowdown that led to the US recession in 2000Source: Bloomberg, Fidante Capital.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Echoes of the late 1990s - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/echoes-of-the-late-1990s"}

Given that this commentary is read mostly by people working in the financial industry, my guess is that many of my readers might have doubts from time to time. After all, we are not firefighters or doctors but money managers and relationship managers. Nevertheless, I was astonished to see the results of a recently published study amongst 100,000 workers in 47 countries that measured what percentage of the workforce considers its job socially useful or useless.8% of workers perceive their jobs as socially useless and 17% are not sure, which indicates that they at least have some doubts about the usefulness of their jobs beyond providing an income to the worker. But this also means that c. 75% of workers consider their job socially useful, or in other words: a large part of the workforce is delusional about the usefulness of their jobs.We live in the 21st century, for heavenxe2x80x99s sake! Unless you are a doctor, farmer or carpenter, chances are you are working in a job that is not necessary and potentially not useful for society. Here is a simple test: If the tasks of your job did not exist a hundred years ago, chances are, it is not contributing very much to society. Most of the jobs created in the last century were invented to provide inputs for parts of the economy that are clearly not essential in nature and would hardly be missed if they were no longer there. If you are a millennial reading this and are outraged about this statement, consider that we used to have a pretty good life before the internet and smartphone came along. Neither of these inventions are necessary and their usefulness for society is at least debatable.In any case, the study showed that there are significant differences in the percentage of workers who perceive their jobs as socially useless. Amongst firefighters, social workers and teachers, the percentage of people who consider their jobs useless are the lowest and often close to zero. But things are more interesting when we focus on the opposite end of the spectrum, the 20 jobs with the largest share of workers who consider their jobs socially useless. Amongst them we find sales and marketing professionals (which include PR professionals), finance managers, brokers, and economists (I am not going to comment on that). In other words, office jobs in the service industry and in business areas that are not producing xe2x80x9cstuffxe2x80x9d are often considered to be socially useless.Funnily enough, the study also found that managers tend to find their jobs socially useless less often than the employees who work for them. A regression analysis shows that the percentage of top-level managers who considered their job socially useless was c. 2.4 points lower than their employees, all else being equal. This can also be seen in our chart below. 21.0% of sales professionals consider their jobs socially useless, while only 11.4% of sales managers consider their jobs useless. I will let you come to your own conclusions as to what may cause this difference in perceptionxe2x80xa6Top 20 occupations by share of workers who consider their job socially uselessSource: Due and van Lendt (2019), Fidante Capital.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"Socially useless jobs - Klement on Investing","url":"https://klementoninvesting.substack.com/p/socially-useless-jobs"}

He had the rest of the week drawn up as a grid too, with blank spaces for last-minute jobs that might pop up on his newly purchased smartphone.He loaded the truck with the tools of his trade: edgers and whips, a spade and a rake, a refurbished secondhand push mower, and drove the ride-on mower (also a refurb) onto the small trailer behind his 15-year-old F150. He put a lunchbox with two turkey sandwiches and four bottles of frozen water into the cab. They would melt during the hot Florida spring day, keeping his food cold and providing hydration as he worked in the full sun.Sometime after 8am, he started having abdominal pains. The worst of his life. My father - no hypochondriac, also the habit of a lifetime - called 911. The hospital did some tests and discharged him by 10am, diagnosis mild constipation, prescription two kinds of laxatives. He didn't feel better. His last few outgoing texts were to friends letting them know he couldn't meet up later, he was sick. He went on to complete 3 of the 5 jobs on his schedule.He died that night. 70 years old, retired not even one day of his life. When we found his phone, most of the missed texts and calls were from the app, set to automatically ping when he didn't check in online for his agreed jobs.\"What, are you too proud to scrub a toilet?\"That was a question I have heard a lot. After coming out as a former sex worker in 2009, I could count on at least one know-it-all standing up to pronounce more or less this exact accusation at every book signing, public speaking event, or festival I appeared at. The question askers never stuck around to hear, really hear the answer: it's hard to get a job in the UK as an American student, I couldn't work more than 15 hours a week, no one was allowed to hire me if any qualified EU applicant was available, and that wouldn't have made a dent in my bills anyway. xe2x80x98Too proud to scrub a toiletxe2x80x99 also seemed to be the takeaway most columnists went with when discussing my writing. According to everyone with a public opinion my problem was not lack of cash but that I was too proud, or precious, or whatever to do real work. I was spoiled.Thing is, I wasn't just spitballing about whether or not scrubbing toilets pays the bills. I knew already, from experience, that it would not - because cleaning was the very last job I held before moving to London. I worked for months at a hostel in Aviemore while writing up my PhD thesis. In between changing beds and mopping bathrooms, I collated data on forensic pathology cases and assembled chapters on the processes of human decomposition. Because I also was the hostelxe2x80x99s cook and lived on site, I was able to save almost everything I earned. I thought this would put me in good stead for the autumn, when I planned to submit my PhD back in Sheffield, then move to London to look for work. Long story short: my calculations of expenses for life in the capital city were way, way off. By the time I paid the extortionate deposit and rent on a sad little room in Kilburn, I was already out of cash. But with my PhD not yet approved I couldnxe2x80x99t apply for science jobs. So I became a call girl. A choice that I thought (also mistakenly as it turned out) would be lucrative, not require a particular visa, and that I could leave behind as soon as I started my xe2x80x9crealxe2x80x9d career.That was then. This is now: I'm scrubbing a toilet in a million dollar house in one of my countyxe2x80x99s fanciest neighborhoods. American Standard. The water in the American Southwest is mineral-heavy and leaves rings on everything; I'm not so much scrubbing as chipping away at stalagmites of built up lime. It's the first toilet I'll clean today, the first of four bathrooms in this house, but it's not the last time I'll think about those people who imagined I was too proud to scrub a toilet. I've been scrub-a-toilet poor before; itxe2x80x99s not that big a deal. No, instead they were telling me the thing they considered to be the last-resort job of choice before \"selling your body.\" Their deepest fear, the most undignified thing short of being a whore (which as we all know is the worst thing a woman can do).Thatxe2x80x99s the calculation according to society. Whore is worst, cleaner is second worst, and no one in their right minds would do either. Let alone both. Yet the jobs persist. Even in a recession. Even in a pandemic. Key workers both. Not the front lines, accumulating accolades and sometimes hazard pay, but the back lines, doing jobs few want to admit always need done.Even in the midst of a global pandemic it seems cleaning after oneself is still a job for someone else. Lifestyle columnists Sarah Ditum and Janice Turner raised a few eyebrows when they staunchly declared the unavailability of house cleaners in the first wave of covid to be beyond bearable. Not for them picking up the mop, or worse yet, asking onexe2x80x99s husband and children to chip in. No, went the logic, cleaners wanted the work. They loved their clients. Ixe2x80x99ve heard people say things like that before almost word for word. People who are the customers of sex workers. Do I have to tell you women like those are just the sort of people whose husbands I once would have fucked for money? I know it, and I guess they know it too.If you too are in possession of a house and neither the time nor the inclination to clean it, you could book me or someone like me through any number of websites and apps. They all have slick, modern sites, enormous market capitalisations, and most importantly in this buoyant gig economy: they employ none of the people who show up at your door to do the work.The landing pages show clean, modern homes resplendent in bare wood, white tile and brushed metal fixtures. Homes with six-burner gas ranges and fresh cut peonies in fishbowl vases. The kind of homes that few of the cleaners could ever dream of calling their own. The vibe is upscale, quiet suburb or cool high-rise urban.And if you donxe2x80x99t mind what happens to your body, to your health, then there are always jobs like this, just not careers. With ubiquitous smartphones and widespread internet services that previously were available mainly to the well-heeled can be booked at the touch of a finger. In many ways the rise of sex workers on the internet when I was an anonymous blogger presaged the way many would soon be working in the 21st century.My entry into cleaning for apps is straightforward. Sign up, submit a photo of my driver's license, wait for a background check. Answer a few (very few) questions on my experience as a cleaner. I have a bit, from the aforementioned pre-London days turning over an 80-bed hostel in the Scottish Highlands for a summer, to helping out friends with holiday cottages. I'm accepted on the platform and my rate is set at $15 per hour. That's 4 dollars an hour above the nearest cityxe2x80x99s minimum wage, more than twice the Federal minimum of $7.25, but well below anything that could result in the \"thousands\" the app's ads on Craigslist promised. Up to thousands, I remind myself. Technically that means anything above zero. I'm assured through a short series of videos that work is straightforward and easy to come by, and that any problems I might experience with the app itself are quick to figure out. I'm told if I book 10 jobs this week my rate goes up, maybe as high as $22. I complete the series of Youtube videos that constitute training and log on.There are no jobs. At all. Not today, and not tomorrow.There's one in three days! I click, eager to \"claim\" before anyone else does (because that must be what's happening, right? There are no jobs because they're already taken?) But when I google the location I find it's in central Colorado - a 330-mile round trip from where I am now. Sure, there's a $20 \"bounty\" for picking this one up, should I choose. But I decide to forego it. There is zero chance at this rate I will ever earn more than $15 an hour through the app.We live in the age of the side hustle. Everyone I've met since moving back to the US has one. The fine artists with an Air B&B, the candle maker who cleans for them, the solar installer who is also a part-time fire captain, the fire captains who sell third party phone cases on Amazon. The jiu-jitsu instructor with a window washing business. The college professor who works as a part-time paramedic on ski patrol. The ski patroller who proctors exams at the college.There is no mystery as to why. None of these people are rich or have any illusions of becoming so. Side hustle as a phrase sounds cool, as if a few hours of your week here and there will make it rain and make the Moet pour. The reality is more prosaic. Life in the land of opportunity is expensive. With a stunted public transport infrastructure, cars are a necessity if you want to get by in most of America. The college degree has more or less taken the place of a high school diploma, sought out even for entry-level customer service, and the expansion of the student loan industry leaves many in debt long beyond their 40's. Credit rating determines everything from your ability to rent accommodation to even whether or not you get a job, obliging people to spend and keep spending in the name of being a trustworthy consumer. Being a consumer obliges you to work. Once entered, the cycle has no end. Not even retirement, for those (unlike my father) lucky enough to contemplate it: in 1985, 10.8% of people over 65 in America were still working. The number in 2017 was double that, and expected to become still higher when the twilight years of Baby Boomers give way to geriatric Generation X.It gets worse. A shocking number of America's personal bankruptcies are due to inability to pay medical bills. From a high of 1.5 million in 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act came into law, it declined to 770 thousand in 2016. And yet the problem is not solved: the requirement to buy insurance even on price-capped markets still leaves a lot of room for expenses in the form of deductibles that can be thousands of dollars or more. People still avoid accessing preventive care and instead end up in the emergency room, sometimes not until they are on death's door. We may be in post-Obamacare America, with many on the left making noises about some form of universal, free-at-the-point-of-delivery healthcare, but the wolf of sudden medical emergency could turn up and destroy your life anytime. Even in the coronavirus pandemic America did not manage to elect a candidate who promises universal healthcare.Four-Toilets is not a bad job as these things go. I know that immediately. It isn't a 330 mile round trip to get there, for starters; only an hour from my house. The place is owned by a couple of about my age, pet- and child-free. They are not hoarders, and while some of it requires elbow grease (the aforementioned hard water in toilets situation) they've not left cleaning so long that any of it is out of hand, save a giant walk-in shower I spend about a third of the allotted five hours scrubbing.The man goes out, and when he comes back, has brought me a sandwich. I don't have time to eat on the clock of course. The app's clients feed in the size of the job and the app gives them an estimated finishing time (no breaks). I do the last toilet, vacuum and mop, and am done bang on the hour the app predicted. I can't help but wonder if there was a box they ticked that said \"our house is already pretty clean\" (it was) or if, in the future, similarly-sized jobs with less scrupulously tidy clients will be assigned the same five-hour time slot.I don't think about that, just sign on to the app to confirm completion of the job, load up my car (you are required to bring all supplies, including mop and vacuum, and more recently, PPE), and accept a shyly-offered $30 tip from the man. They want to book me again, once every fortnight. I say I'll have a look on the app but I'd like that.I have no illusions: few jobs will be as straightforward as this. On the drive home, I start making a list of what I need to replenish. Paper towels, microfibre rags, oven cleaner, furniture polish. Pick up some limescale remover! And some drain unclogging liquid. The tip covers my time driving to and from the house, and the gas, just about. It reminds me of being an escort when the client's tips usually covered my transport.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Do you have any idea as to why sex work is viewed differently in Australia or New Zealand(or even the Netherlands and Germany)? All four are very capitalist societies like the US and UK. Yes, I know the laws are different in these places but there has to be a reason the law is different. One obvious explanation is radical or carceral feminism doesn't have really that strong of roots in any of these places and all four are basically very male dominated societies.Beautiful reportage.

It currently sits at #2 on the App Store charts in the US. The app is primarily a place where you can go to watch short and looping videos of people doing anything and everything, from dancing  to sharing tip and tricks on how to cook the best fried rice.The main screen in TikTok is called the xe2x80x9cFor Youxe2x80x9d page (FYP) which algorithmically surfaces videos the app thinks you will enjoy most. You can swipe up to go to the next video, or swipe down to see the previous again. If you watched a typical user on TikTok, you would see them staring at their phone while swiping up every 10-30 seconds for a hours at a time. There is such a variety of content on TikTok that any user can find videos and creators they likexe2x80xa6but it is the best-in-class algorithm that surfaces these videos that really gives TikTok its edge over the competition.Both Instagram and Snapchat have tried to clone the exact feature-set of TikTok, however, they have had limited success with their versions. I think the biggest reason for their failures so far is they do not have the creator talent that TikTok has. While both Instagram and Snapchat have larger and more accurate networks of your friends and family, the popularity of TikTok is not driven by that. TikTokxe2x80x99s content comes from celebrities in the same way that movies and shows on Netflix or HBO are driven by the leading actor or actress. The best people in a position to create TikTok-like content are creating that content on TikTok. Additionally, a lot of the content on Instagram Reels is actually just re-posted videos from TikTok. It is as if Netflix was only filled with low quality reposts of tv shows from HBO.On Instagram and Snapchat you are primarily seeing content from your own network of friends. However, there is no reason to assume that group of people is the most entertaining group of people in the world. Or that they would be the best dancers, or the best chefs. On TikTok, because the content is driven by an engagement algorithm and not your friend circle, you can watch content from the most entertaining creators in the world.Lastly, this fact has allowed xe2x80x9cregular peoplexe2x80x9d who are not usually considered celebrities to create large followings on TikTok, because they are actually one of the best people in the world at creating entertaining content about a certain topic. TikTok has created a middle-class of creators who can make a sizable amount of money by posting videos that millions across the world consume. The other feature that has powered the growth of these creators is remixes. One example of a remix is when a user creates a dance to a song, and then thousands of other users will post their own video doing the same dance to the song. This creates attribution to the original post and helps spread the influence of that user. There are many dancers on TikTok who have created dances to songs that were xe2x80x9cremixedxe2x80x9d by millions. This also works as a method to drive up the popularity of songs. There are now so-called xe2x80x9cTikTok songsxe2x80x9d which are songs that gained awareness through users posting dance videos with that song in the background. TikTok even published a list of the most popular songs in 2020:As the TikTok blog post states:The below list of the ten fastest songs to reach 1 billion video views reflects the community's enthusiasm for new songs by stars like Drake and Billie Eilish, but some of the year's most viral hits came from unexpected sources. The list includes rap hits from regional stars like Detroit's Sada Baby and Houston's BeatKing, and songs by artists like Popp Hunna and WhoHeem who were virtually unknown before their viral moment. Songs didn't have to be new, or even recently released to cross the billion view threshold: \"Say I Yi Yi\" (2002) and \"Where Is The Love?\" (2003) demonstrated how the TikTok community can turn catalog cuts into viral hits. Check out the top ten below: We can see that TikTok is not only expanding the influence of their most popular creators, but it also acts as a new platform for up and coming artists to post their music in hopes of it blowing up to a catchy dance. If you donxe2x80x99t know any other TikTok users personally, your experience isnxe2x80x99t any worse. This could never happen on a typical social network because you are limited to only seeing what your friends post.Netflix and YouTube were the first platforms to surface entertainment content from users around the world based off of algorithmically driven engagement, however, TikTok has taken it to a whole new level. Netflix shows are typically 20-60 minutes and movies are usually closer to 2 hours, while YouTube has an average video length of around 12 minutes. However, TikTok videos are always less than a minute. This means that TikTok is getting an order of magnitude more signals to use in their algorithm. More signals mean a better algorithm that can more precisely show you the exact content you will enjoy the most.TikTok is a new mobile-first hybrid of streaming service and social network. In a sense, TikTok is everything Quibi wasnxe2x80x99t: a mobile-first entertainment network. Instead of taking the Quibi path of hand-selecting Hollywood content like a typical production studio, TikTok outsourced content creation and used algorithmic curation. Instagram was the original mobile-first social network, and TikTok has now become the first mobile-only entertainment network.If you have not tried TikTok because you donxe2x80x99t think there will be any content you enjoy, I encourage you to give it a try.

I have asked some of my friends at others schools, and they all tell me that they had very similar experiences.The primary reason for this, is that it is extremely easy to add new friends on Snapchat. Using a branded QR code that contains a userxe2x80x99s profile information, called a Snapcode, a user can quickly add another just by opening the app.The use of these Snapcodes allow users to quickly share their profile so other users can add them to their friends. This is much faster than adding somebodyxe2x80x99s phone number to your contacts (1 second scanning a Snapcode vs. 1 minute manually typing out their name and phone number). This comes in especially handy during an event like orientation; where groups of people who have never met all want to exchange information to stay in contact. Additionally, since adding someone on Snapchat is a two-way action (just like Facebook friend requests), only one person has to scan the Snapcode to become friends, and now both people can stay connected.The other aspect that makes Snapchat ideal for first time connections is people often have a lower barrier of entry into their Snapchat friends than they do into their phone contacts. This means, that there are lower stakes in asking for someonexe2x80x99s xe2x80x9csnapxe2x80x9d as opposed to asking for their phone number. This is much more of a cultural phenomenon as opposed to a feature within Snapchat, but this drives a lot of people to reach for Snapchat as the first place they connect. Whether at a party, or on a dating app, adding each other on Snapchat is often the default way to move the conversation forward.With Snapchat being the first place many people in college are adding each other, it now means that they can use all of additional features of Snapchat to help manage their newly formed connections. Salesforce (a leading CRM provider) defines a CRM as such:Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships to grow your business.For college kids, we can think of using CRM software as a way to improve your personal relationships, instead of your professional relationships. Through this view, we see how Snapchat provides a range of features targeted at improving usersxe2x80x99 personal relationships:Location: Snapchat allows a user to see where their friends are throughout the world on an easy to use map. This means I can easily see if I have any friends in the city Ixe2x80x99m currently staying in, or I can look to see where a specific friend is. If I am visiting a new city that I may not know particularly well, I can go on Snapchat and message any friends who may be in the same area. You can also choose to only share your location with specific friends, or disable the feature entirely.Streaks + Charms: For friends that you communicate with frequently, Snapchat has a system of xe2x80x9cstreaksxe2x80x9d where you get a badge next to their name with a number to signify how many days in a row you have stayed in touch (both users must send the other a message every 24 hours). This has no doubt helped with retention and engagement for the app itself, but it also provides a nice push to continue to stay in touch (every day!) with your friends. It is not uncommon for people to have many streaks that are in the high hundreds or even thousands of days, meaning that these people have snapped each other every day for 3 or 4 years. My personal longest streak is 1,455. In addition to streaks, Snapchat also a number of trinkets, which it calls xe2x80x9cCharmsxe2x80x9d, that describe your friendship with another user. Here is an example of what that looks like:Birthdays + Signs: Similar to Facebook, Snapchat also shows you when it is one of your friendxe2x80x99s birthday. This makes it easy to send them a happy birthday message to reignite a relationship that may have dwindled out. Additionally, based off of a userxe2x80x99s birthday, Snapchat now displays astrological signs. You can read about your own astrological chart, or explore a friendxe2x80x99s chart. This is not something that I use, but it is another way to keep in touch with your friends.With all of these features encouraging engagement, the final piece of the puzzle that makes Snapchat ideal for maintaining a large number of personal relationships is its primary messaging format: selfies. The idea of sending selfies back and forth (often without any context or other text) may seem strange to someone who did not grow up using Snapchat. However, it has become commonplace now with young adults and teenagers. Since sending a selfie is very quick and low pressure, while also intimate, it provides a quick and efficient manner to continue your relationships with little effort. While it may seem trivial, seeing a friendxe2x80x99s face every day does bring a certain type of closeness to that relationship. In a time where our faces are often hidden behind masks, a selfie of your best friend can be just what you need to brighten your day.Snapchat not just encourages you, but makes it easy, to stay in touch with your friends over long distances and long periods of time. So, itxe2x80x99s no surprise that Snapchat is the place where college kids choose to maintain and grow their personal relationships.xe2x9cx8cxefxb8x8f JasonThis is just the second article that Ixe2x80x99ve published for my newsletter.

According to Our World in Data, we have only given out about 2.8 million doses. Additionally, the CDC said that it had delivered 10.2 million doses to states as of Wednesday. This clearly misses the Trump administration promise to give out 20 million vaccinations by the end of 2020 (not exactly surprisingxe2x80xa6but still). This NYTimes piece is tracking both vaccine distributions and dose administrations across different states.While these numbers are going in the right direction (thankfully this is a number we want to keep increasing), we are not giving enough people the vaccine each day. I see piece after piece after piece talking about how slowly the vaccine rollout is going, itxe2x80x99s not like this is a secret. It is very clear that giving vaccines to people RIGHT NOW is not something we can mess up. With the new strain of the vaccine spreading throughout the world, every second we are wasting means an increasing amount of deaths. Just take a look at this article from The Atlantic, The Mutated Virus Is a Ticking Time Bomb.I saw earlier in the week on Twitter Patrick Collison and Patrick McKenzie tweet out the same article by Scott Aaronson. It is an exploration of what we could have done differently in the US to develop and distribute the vaccine over the summer. While Ixe2x80x99m not sure if everything he proposes would work (I think we still need strict safety protocols to ensure the efficacy and safety of vaccines), the point is that we need action and we need to start trying things. Now that we have two vaccines which all the data so far point to being both efficacious and safe, we need to be doing everything in our collective human (and robot) power to deliver these vaccines into peoplexe2x80x99s arms. I think this excerpt from the update on Scottxe2x80x99s post particularly stands out:Crucially, this is not because of any problem with manufacturing or supply, but just because of pure bureaucratic blank-facedness. Incredibly, even as the pandemic rages, most of the vaccines are sitting in storage, at severe risk of spoiling xe2x80xa6 and officialsxe2x80x99 primary concern is not to administer the precious doses, but just to make sure no one gets a dose xe2x80x9cout of turn.xe2x80x9d In contrast to Israel, where theyxe2x80x99re now administering vaccines 24/7, including on Shabbat, with the goal being to get through the entire population as quickly as possible, in the US theyxe2x80x99re moving at a snailxe2x80x99s pace and took off for the holidays.xe2x80x94 Scott AaronsonHere are some of Patrick McKenziexe2x80x99s ideas to solve the problem:January 1st 2021January 1st 2021January 1st 2021I think these are great ideas. Every single Wallgreens and CVS store in the country should be getting doses ASAP. We absolutely need to prioritize front line workers, elderly citizens, and other high-risk individuals; however, the key word is prioritize. The idea that there are leftover doses that are not being delivered to people who are willing to get the vaccine (and wait in line or pay to do so), is mind-blowing. It is unconscionable.In a response to Patrickxe2x80x99s Twitter thread, a user responded with this:Patrick McKenzie @patio11January 2nd 2021If this is true (which I have no reason to think itxe2x80x99s not), whoever prevented this is the one who should be fired and their license taken away. This is so fucking backwards I donxe2x80x99t even want to think about it. First, if those are the rules, they should all be broken so that we can administer as many doses as possible and anyone that stands in the way should be fired. Second, the system (institutions and people and bureaucracy) that made these rules need to be reformed or disbanded. Full Stop.Before we started giving out doses, much of the conversation revolved around how we can manufacture enough vaccine doses and get them to where they need to be so they can be administered. However, we can see now that the last mile delivery is the real bottleneck. We should be administering as many doses as possible, where the only bottleneck is actually how fast we can manufacture and ship vials to vaccination sites.Instead, we have governors increasing penalties for people who are doing trying to do their best to give the vaccine out to as many people as possible. Increasing penalties will mean that people spend more time making sure they follow every little rule (in fear of fine or revocation of their license) than they spend actually administering the vaccine.Again, this is a time for deregulation, to make sure that everybody is working together towards a common cause: getting vaccine doses into peoplexe2x80x99s arms. This should be a war time effort. Within the next two weeks, America needs to dramatically scale the number of shots we are giving out, because right now is our only chance.In Israel, instead of doubling down on already overly bureaucratic rules, this is what they are doing:xd7xa0xd7x93xd7x91 xd7x90xd7x99xd7x9c Nadav Eyal @Nadav_EyalDecember 31st 2020This should not be controversial. This is so clearly the path that every single country in the world (yes, including the US) should be taking right now.Ixe2x80x99d love to hear more ideas about how we can get vaccines into peoplexe2x80x99s arms.

The idea is that users will be able to lend to margin traders on the platform. Lending opened on the 28th and almost immediately filled up. Given how busy I was this week, I wasnxe2x80x99t able to participate. However, Ixe2x80x99m looking forward to seeing how this progresses in the future and will look to take part when it presumably opens up indefinitely.A court recommended that Craig Wright must surrender over $4 billion in Bitcoin to the Kleiman estate. If youxe2x80x99re not familiar with crypto news, then you may not know that Craig Wright has been claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto for awhile now, and suing anyone who says hexe2x80x99s lying.One important aspect of public key cryptography is if someone was Satoshi Nakamoto they could prove this fact mathematically. So far, no one has done this. Anyone claiming to be Satoshi who doesnxe2x80x99t prove it cryptographically will be branded a fraud by the crypto community regardless of the evidence they bring in support of their claim.I think whatxe2x80x99s happened is both Craig and Kleiman were early adopters of Bitcoin. They both purchased and mined Bitcoin early. They formed some kind of business relationship and, since the Bitcoin wasnxe2x80x99t worth much back then, were exchanging keys or using multi-sigs. After Kleiman passed away Craig took all of the Bitcoin they held jointly and now the Kleiman family wants Kleimanxe2x80x99s Bitcoin back. If Craig and Kleiman used a multi-sig and Kleiman held part of the private key (hexe2x80x99s since passed away), then there is a chance that Craig is telling the truth in that he cannot access the Bitcoin. Also, if my conjecture is correct, the court case has nothing to do with Satoshi Nakamoto. Although, it makes the headline more appealing if Craigxe2x80x99s Satoshi claims are included in it.This is interesting from a legal perspective though, because when it comes to crypto one could always claim to have xe2x80x9clostxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cforgottenxe2x80x9d, or never to have owned the private keys to an address. How does the court prove that someone does in fact control the private keys to an address? Presumably you could use chain analysis, but for addresses who mined a lot at the beginning and havenxe2x80x99t done anything with the coins since then, these tactics are rendered useless. At any rate, that is what must be proven here in order for the Kleiman estate to get the $4 billion in Bitcoin that would be lawfully theirs if this recommendation is held up in appeals courts.I heard about EthHub on last weekxe2x80x99s episode of Epicenter. Both Eric and Anthony seem like good guys. Whether or not I agree with someonexe2x80x99s viewpoints, I respect them taking action to build things in order to support their viewpoints.EthHub is a central place where Eric and Anthony put documentation such that it can be linked to when people are spreading misinformation about Ethereum. This way they donxe2x80x99t have to continue repeating themselves in responses. They also have a podcast and weekly newsletter which are linked to on EthHub. Ixe2x80x99m not as active in the Ethereum community as I used to be, but Ixe2x80x99d definitely recommend checking their content out if youxe2x80x99re interested in keeping up to date on the nitty-gritty of Ethereum development.Quantopian appears to be a Kaggle for stock market prediction. Quantopian provides Python libraries you can use to analyze stock market datasets and backtest trading strategies. I heard about Quantopian on a Blind thread about passive income where a Facebook data scientist claimed they were making $1K monthly in royalties from an algorithm a hedge fund was leasing from them on Quantopian. Ixe2x80x99ve only had time to dabble in Quantopian this week due to my hectic schedule, but this looks like something Ixe2x80x99d like to continue to investigate and write about going forward.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"$4 Billion, Binance Lending, and EthHub - Console","url":"https://console.substack.com/p/4-billion-binance-lending-and-ethhub-b1a053f3e26"}

The point of the passage is to illustrate an approach to problem solving whereby you assume what youxe2x80x99re trying to prove or find is in fact true. You do this to investigate the properties of this xe2x80x9cobjectxe2x80x9d that youxe2x80x99re searching for in a sort of working backward approach. In effect, starting from what properties the proposed solution to a problem would have to have, rather than starting with the given data and moving forward to the end solution. This approach works well for proofs by contradiction or what Polya calls Reductio ad Absurdum in the book.xe2x80x9cA wise man begins in the end, and a fool ends in the beginning.xe2x80x9dTranslating ideas in English into mathematical notation is important, and also something I was particularly bad at. Although, I didnxe2x80x99t know I was bad at this until the fact that this translation was happening and was a necessary step to solving math problems was spelled out by Polya. He compares translating an idea into mathematical notation to translating English into French. In this way, you canxe2x80x99t do a simple translation of the English words directly into French words as youxe2x80x99re likely to miss some context. You also canxe2x80x99t always directly translate an idea into mathematical notation and should keep an eye out for using the appropriate notation when doing a translation as it can be the difference between having an xe2x80x9ca-haxe2x80x9d moment with a problem and missing it.I happened upon this project from an interview on software engineering daily about data engineering (in this case data lineage). Ixe2x80x99d heard senior engineers discuss the idea and was curious to see how Airbnb was approaching the problem. The approach theyxe2x80x99ve taken is to treat data exploration as a social media problem. In this way users and knowledge holders of the data can connect, pin, and like data sources. Presumably, the more liked a data source is, the more useful it would be. Also, if someone youxe2x80x99re working with has pinned a data source, it seems plausible that you would also be interested in this data source.

This is because in programming, you need an intuition and an implementation. If the implementation works thatxe2x80x99s usually the end of the story (although it can be argued that this shouldnxe2x80x99t be the case). Itxe2x80x99s very infrequent in software engineering that youxe2x80x99re expected to prove anything. Because of this I never developed skill in proof. Some might say this is not a problem, but speaking from experience, it is. Here is why: skill in formal proof can often drive intuition, even as much as the opposite is true. Understanding where youxe2x80x99re going, and the options related to how to get there (you can take a bus, you can fly, you could walk, etc), can often lead you in directions you wouldnxe2x80x99t expect to go in.I would often get to a point of understanding a math problem, even convince myself of the mechanics of the problem and find a solution, but when it came time to prove it, nothing. I was bad at convincing not only myself, but any reader. This is because you get little to no practice doing this in a computer science curriculum.As an aside, I think checking that your logic is sound after developing an intuition is also important as an intermediate step in computer science that is often dropped (as it was for me). The steps to a computer science solution should be intuition -> convince yourself that the intuition is correct -> xe2x80x9ccheck each step of the argumentxe2x80x9d -> code -> xe2x80x9ccheck each step of the implementationxe2x80x9d.Given this is my first post in this newsletter, Ixe2x80x99m going to make a second observation from the book. Polyaxe2x80x99s introduction of the xe2x80x9cunknownxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cconstraintxe2x80x9d, and xe2x80x9cdataxe2x80x9d of a problem that can be applied almost universally is a useful tool, particularly when applied to the part of the book outlining different approaches to varying these xe2x80x9cpartsxe2x80x9d to a problem.The importance of patience in a work context is something Ixe2x80x99ve had to learn with experience (itxe2x80x99s almost impossible for someone to give you this feedback as it could easily be misunderstood by the person receiving the feedback, so managers tend to avoid giving it). When given a task, particularly a complex task, I was prone to diving right in to the problem to arrive at a solution quickly. There is something about visual effort in that a junior engineer wants to appease their superiors by delivering something even if it isnxe2x80x99t the exact correct thing. Usually this is fine. As long as youxe2x80x99re close enough to correct, it can be course corrected by more senior employees. But, sometimes you may be way off, causing a long delay between being assigned the task and the ultimate solution due to your impatience. Ixe2x80x99ve learned to be more effective by being patient when given a new task. Donxe2x80x99t be afraid to xe2x80x9cperusexe2x80x9d. You should know what you plan to do in very good detail before carrying it out. The act of carrying it out should be just that, carrying it out, nothing more. You should not be finding new things out in the act of enacting your plan. If you do not have this clear path forward, you should not be proceeding and should instead either investigate the thing blocking you further, ask questions, or often, wait for something to happen. Experienced management will understand this and will respect you for showing restraint and patience much more than they will laud your ability to dive in. Effective, prudent, deep dive is the goal.These opinions are my own, and not those of any of my employers past or present.Donxe2x80x99t forget to follow me on twitter, add me on linkedin, add me on facebook, subscribe to my blog, or follow me on medium for more content like this.

Often Ixe2x80x99m doing things that have never been done before on the planet, such as connecting ETHLend to uPort for example. This gives me a unique perspective into the daily lives of decentralized developers. At the same time I work for a very large and customer centric tech company. The mesh of these two perspectives has led me to ponder the following question: Is the first to market advantage of centralized user experience too powerful for decentralized tech to overcome?Ethereum is often touted as xe2x80x9cweb3.0xe2x80x9d. Itxe2x80x99s true that what decentralized technologies are trying to accomplish are magnificent and gargantuan tasks. Itxe2x80x99s also true that using ethereum and other decentralized software feels like using the internet in the early days of the web. Back then you often had to do what seemed like mysterious incantations, without much idea as to what they were actually doing. Obviously most cryptocurrency feels very much the same way, with things like the iota wallet showing no balance (1,2,3,4,5,6) and the DAO hack. This makes for an easy comparison to the early web, however, I argue that the comparison is a bit too easy.User experience on the centralized web is miles ahead of where it was originally, which makes it miles ahead of its decentralized counterparts. I donxe2x80x99t see regular users leaving the comforts of their Mercedes to jump back on the horse and buggy of decentralized user experience. And, more importantly, I believe that this analogue will always be valid.This is not to say that evangelists and technocrats wonxe2x80x99t fully embrace this tech in much the same way as the early internet was embraced. This is because most of us understand whatxe2x80x99s happening behind the mask of UI and are much more willing to forgive technical mistakes or ineptitudes than the average user. My concern is not that the tech wonxe2x80x99t be adopted, but that the adoption will never grow above a certain percentage of the population.As stated above, itxe2x80x99s easy to look to the technological growth of the internet as an example for decentralized tech to emulate. The problem with this perspective is, the internet didnxe2x80x99t have to compete with itself. The internet competed with print, and I would argue, until the user experience felt effortless, it fought an uphill battle in much the same say decentralized tech is fighting now. The problem is, the current state of user experience on the internet is so far ahead of its decentralized counterparts, and will continue to outpace the growth of its decentralized counterparts.One could argue that user experience isnxe2x80x99t everything. The needs decentralized technologies are attempting to fill are not necessarily motivated by user experience (although, I would argue the motivations of a technology should always be driven by user experience, but thatxe2x80x99s a different discussion for a different day). However, in order to achieve mass adoption, a superior, or at least equal, decentralized user experience must be achieved.Put yourself in a laymanxe2x80x99s shoes. They donxe2x80x99t understand what the decentralized tech is trying to achieve, they just know it is or isnxe2x80x99t working as well as the centralized version, and will therefore go back to the centralized alternative in the case when it isnxe2x80x99t. Take the case of steemit. Theyxe2x80x99re paying people to use the platform, but the UX is lagging so far behind that of reddit that it doesnxe2x80x99t matter. People still continue to stay on reddit, and, even after trying steemit will return to reddit.This leads me to my final point. Engineers are users too. Building good, clean, maintainable software, such as reddit, is a difficult enough job as it is. Software developers donxe2x80x99t need to make their difficult jobs any more difficult than they already are. This is exactly what theyxe2x80x99d be doing by opting for decentralized tooling. The current state of affairs with respect to infrastructure surrounding the modern web makes software development a pleasant experience. The same cannot be said for the decentralized tool kit. I hope this changes in the future, but I fear that much like user experience, the tooling of the modern web is also so far ahead, and will continue to outpace its decentralized counterparts, that this will never happen.This is in large part due to the Pareto Law nature of technology. The decentralized web must compete with the centralized web. The centralized web is an internet of billions of dollars in capital, allowing it to hire hundreds of millions of software engineers to work on even the most minute detail of its infrastructure. While the decentralized alternatives have a hundred thousand at most scattered about the globe working for less, and often for free. Donxe2x80x99t get me wrong, I commend their efforts, and count myself as one, considering I spend my weekends writing about this tech.With cryptocurrency, however, more and more funding is being poured into the decentralized alternatives, which is why itxe2x80x99s even possible to argue against centralization right now. This is actually my main motivation for investing in cryptocurrency. I invest not because Ixe2x80x99m interested in buying a lambo, but because I know the only way to spearhead this technology is to put capital into it and see where that takes us. It remains to be seen if this funding can ever eclipse the centralized counterparts, however.Wexe2x80x99ve all seen these little infographics showing how cryptocurrency actually stacks up against companies like Apple and Amazon. Granted, this one is dated, but, even with the unprecedented surge in bitcoin price, all of cryptocurrency still doesnxe2x80x99t match Amazonxe2x80x99s market cap.This is why I wonxe2x80x99t be quitting my day job any time soon to join the decentralized army full time. As an engineer I firmly believe that decentralized technology is a more robust design than the centralized alternatives, but the cat is out of the bag. Users have grown too accustomed to having their data now. Donxe2x80x99t get me wrong, the engineering involved in bringing centralized software to fruition is absolutely brilliant, and has taken decades to perfect. I believe decentralized tech will get there one day. But when that day comes, the bar for user experience will be moved still higher by centralized technology.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The Internet vs Itself - Console","url":"https://console.substack.com/p/the-internet-vs-itself-a31e18a6713c"}

This particular white paper was centred around the consensus protocol. If Dfinity is in fact planning to release many white papers it makes sense that they would release the consensus white paper first, as the consensus layer is the foundation for any other innovations that will come from the larger Dfinity tech stack. The core of Dfinityxe2x80x99s biggest consensus innovation is the threshold relay, which uses BLS cryptography, and is encased in this consensus white paper. This post is intended to be a very broad overview of the consensus white paper. However, I intend to do a follow up post detailing BLS cryptography and threshold signatures, the main drivers of innovation in this white paper.Letxe2x80x99s begin with the Verifiable Random Function (VRF), as this is the smallest building block of the Dfinity protocol. A VRF is very simply, a pseudo-random function that provides publicly verifiable proofs of its outputsxe2x80x99 correctness. If we recall from my previous post xe2x80x9cThe Blockchain from a Git Perspectivexe2x80x9d I point out that from a git perspective, consensus is simply randomizing the selection of the maintainer of the xe2x80x9crepoxe2x80x9d, where the repo is the block chain. I then make the claim that proof of work mining is simply a method for distributing the amount of time a node on the network is allowed to be the maintainer of the repo. But this begs the question hundreds of engineers have asked since Bitcoin: what if, rather than competing to act as the maintainer of the repo by burning electricity to secure the block chain, there was some other method of randomly selecting the maintainer of the repo? Enter the VRF.What if there was a way to randomly select a maintainer of the repo without relying on a proof of work competition? Lets say every block included in it the name of the maintainer of the next block, but no one could guess which name would be chosen, not even the current maintainer, until the block was created. At a very basic level, this is what the VRF enables. However, rather than the name of a maintainer randomly being selected, the VRF is used to randomly select a group which can then be used to randomly select the group after that, and so on.A broad overview of the Dfinity block chain. Here the VRFs are the little red rectangles xe2x80x9cRand i xe2x80x94 1xe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cRand ixe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cRand i + 1xe2x80x9d, etc. The outputs of the VRF aid in randomly selecting each group, xe2x80x9cGroup ixe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cGroup i + 1xe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cGroup i + 2xe2x80x9d, etc.If we can devise a method for a de-centrally agreed upon VRF, it should be relatively easy to randomly select a miner without the need for proof of work. The VRF is triggered every block to produce a new output using BLS cryptography in the Dfinity protocol. This per block VRF is dubbed the random beacon and has various use cases in the Dfinity block chain.This hypothetical decentralized VRF is all well and good, but how is it achieved in practice? Recall, it must be trustless the same way proof of work is. This is where Dfinity has made a major breakthrough. Theyxe2x80x99re using BLS rather than RSA or ECDSA, due to the fact that has a unique* threshold version as well as a distributed key generation for this unique threshold version. This allows for a signature to be valid if a threshold of private keys signing the message is reached.A brief example. Letxe2x80x99s say 100 nodes are randomly selected to partake in the generation of the next random beacon value, and the threshold has been set to 51. This means that after 51 of the 100 randomly selected nodes have signed the message, the system will generate the next random beacon value for the entire network.A screen shot of selected nodes in the Dfinity network. For our example, green nodes are the nodes selected by the previous random beacon to sign the current random beacon, and there are 100 of them. The grey nodes are all nodes in the Dfinity network. Of the 100 green nodes, 51 would have to sign the message to propagate the next random beacon value to the rest of the network.Whatxe2x80x99s amazing about this process is, it doesnxe2x80x99t matter which 51 of the 100 nodes sign the message, it will always produce the same random output, and this random output can always be verified of correctness. The random beacon output generated in our toy example is then used by the system to randomly select the next 100 nodes to generate the next random beacon value, ad infinitum. This is called the Threshold Relay.Now that we have a trustless agreed upon method for generating randomness in the block chain, itxe2x80x99s a simple matter of using this random value to do various things on the block chain, such as selecting block makers, or a random subset of nodes for the random beacon generation of the next round (the 100 randomly selected nodes in our example).Hate to use this again, but, it illustrates exactly what the random beacon is/can used for. It ties together both the block chain and the threshold relay chain, which is why I focused so heavily on it in this post. However, a decentrally agreed upon source of verifiable randomness could be used for a whole host of things.But why does this matter? So we have a different way of selecting a xe2x80x9cmaintainerxe2x80x9d of our repo, who cares? Well firstly, this is much more computationally, and therefore economically, efficient than proof of work. Wexe2x80x99ve all heard the stories of Bitcoin mining using more power than Ireland. Message signing is a constant time operation, while proof of work is anything but constant. There are also claims of empty blocks being mined in the Ethereum block chain in order for the miner to get the block out in time and receive the block reward.The threshold relay also allows for faster block speeds, as block time is simply a system parameter to be tweaked, rather than dependent on peculiarities of the crypto economics of proof of work (see the BCH xe2x80x9cemergencyxe2x80x9d difficulty adjustment).Perhaps most importantly, however, Dfinity has devised a way to achieve near instant finality using what they call notarizations. This is unheard of in block chain. Even if Ethereum manages to roll out proof of stake, it will still be hampered by lengthy finality times due to the fact that an adversary could theoretically hide a mined longer chain (this is why you have to wait for X transactions to be confirmed before your balance shows up in exchanges by the way). In Dfinity, this is not possible.Note that this is an extremely simplistic view of the Dfinity protocol (Ixe2x80x99ve left things like block notarization out). But I didnxe2x80x99t want to inundate readers with complex explanations and math proofs. I understand, however, that Dfinity must go through this pedantry in a white paper, particularly to defend the block speeds theyxe2x80x99re claiming to achieve.Given how important BLS and threshold signatures are to this protocol, I intend to add a second post teasing apart this cryptography in more detail, not only for my own benefit, but also my readers. Until then!*Dfinity defines uniqueness in the whitepaper as: A signature scheme is called unique if for every message and every public key there is only one signature that validates successfully. This property applies to single signature schemes and threshold signature schemes alike.For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.No posts","title":"The Dfinity Consensus White Paper - Console","url":"https://console.substack.com/p/the-dfinity-consensus-white-paper-7b5c50f78a86"}

Even this guy:My favorite part of the video I watched recently was when he said: xe2x80x9cEther, or Ethereum, Ethereum is the more scientific name for Etherxe2x80x9dBecause of this, Ixe2x80x99m getting a lot of questions about Bitcoin, but almost none about cryptocurrency. People are having a hard enough time wrapping their heads around the technology of Bitcoin that theyxe2x80x99re not even bothering to ask about the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem. Theyxe2x80x99re also equating Bitcoin to cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, yes, but Bitcoin is not the cryptocurrency. This may seem obvious, and indeed it is. However, people are conflating the price and notoriety of Bitcoin with the tech of Bitcoin, thinking, xe2x80x9csince Bitcoin has the highest market cap, surely it must have the best technology, and the most utility, therefore, whatever Jackson says about Bitcoin must hold at least somewhat for the entirety of the cryptocurrency marketxe2x80x9d, which is patently false.An example. Someone recently told me they asked their financial advisor about buying Bitcoin, and he told them it was a ponzi scheme and to steer clear. I think this financial advisor came to the right conclusion, but probably for the wrong reasons. If youxe2x80x99d have asked him what he thinks about cryptocurrency in general he probably wouldxe2x80x99ve said the same thing, but thatxe2x80x99s because his only frame of reference for cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. Bitcoin may very will be a xe2x80x9cponzi schemexe2x80x9d (I donxe2x80x99t know if it is or isnxe2x80x99t, so donxe2x80x99t ask me) but that doesnxe2x80x99t say anything about cryptocurrency generally.But, Ixe2x80x99ve also had numerous discussions with engineers who view it the same way. Many call Bitcoin digital gold, which is one step removed from real gold, of which the famous Warren Buffet has this to say:The second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything, but that are purchased in the buyerxe2x80x99s hope that someone else xe2x80x94 who also knows that the assets will be forever unproductive xe2x80x94 will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of such buyers in the 17th century.This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce xe2x80x94 it will remain lifeless forever xe2x80x94 but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more avidly in the future.The major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however, has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis.As xe2x80x9cbandwagonxe2x80x9d investors join any party, they create their own truth xe2x80x94 for a while. Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the xe2x80x9cproofxe2x80x9d delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers xe2x80x94 for a time xe2x80x94 expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: xe2x80x9cWhat the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.xe2x80x9dToday the worldxe2x80x99s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce xe2x80x94 goldxe2x80x99s price as I write this xe2x80x94 its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.Letxe2x80x99s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the worldxe2x80x99s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make todayxe2x80x99s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers xe2x80x94 whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators xe2x80x94 must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops xe2x80x94 and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, itxe2x80x99s likely many will still rush to gold. Ixe2x80x99m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.I canxe2x80x99t blame Mr. Buffet for not investing in Bitcoin. However, hexe2x80x99s recently said he was wrong about Google and Amazon. Buffet isnxe2x80x99t a technologist, hexe2x80x99s a financier. He also claims he only invests in things he understands. I donxe2x80x99t blame him, or many other people for not understanding this tech and itxe2x80x99s nuance.However, I tend to agree with Mr. Buffet, and the financial advisor with regard to Bitcoin. Bitcoin may very well be a ponzi scheme in as much as gold is. Bitcoin core is positioning itself as a digital gold, as such, if you donxe2x80x99t think gold is a solid investment, you probably shouldnxe2x80x99t invest in Bitcoin, using the logic given above by Buffet. But this does not mean that all cryptocurrencies are positioning themselves as digital gold and that you shouldnxe2x80x99t invest in any cryptocurrencies.*Also, while Ixe2x80x99m at it, too many people who havenxe2x80x99t investigated the cryptocurrency ecosystem are substituting arguments against Bitcoin with arguments against cryptocurrency in general. What may hold true for Bitcoin in an argument does not necessarily hold true for all cryptocurrencies.Speaking as a software engineer, wexe2x80x99re trained to crystallize logical concepts, and then use these crystallized logical structures to build more logical structures on top of the existing ones, and with the block chain, wexe2x80x99re doing just that. Block chain engineers are extrapolating from Bitcoinxe2x80x99s block chain structure, building new things with it everyday. One of the breakthroughs for me when learning about cryptocurrency was when I investigated Ethereum and saw the inferences made from Bitcoinxe2x80x99s original block chain. Once this connection was made I started to realize the possibilities were vast, not just internal to the Ethereum block chain as many before me have already stated, but with the block chain concept as a whole. Wexe2x80x99re still trying to figure out which building blocks fit where, which are useless, and which will form the backbone of this new landscape. But thatxe2x80x99s technology. There will be many more innovations to come, as this technology is very much still in itxe2x80x99s infancy.Yes, wexe2x80x99re in a cryptocurrency bubble, and everyone is trying to cash in on the craze. But this doesnxe2x80x99t mean there isnxe2x80x99t still true innovation and disruption happening in computation in this space. But also, whatxe2x80x99s wrong with a bubble? Look at the beautiful infrastructure and technology the last tech bubble gave us. The cryptocurrency bubble is turning heads, just as the dot-com bubble did before it, and luring brilliant engineers into itxe2x80x99s fold due to these absurd valuations. Yes, a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money, but a lot of people have, and will continue to, make a lot of money, just as they did during the dot-com bubble, and I donxe2x80x99t think there is anything wrong with that.*note: this also doesnxe2x80x99t mean that Bitcoinxe2x80x99s only use is as a digital store of value, but for the sake of keeping this digestible for beginners, I wonxe2x80x99t go there. In fact, the only reason I bring this up is because I know advanced readers from the Bitcoin community are going to pitch a fit about this.

In a brief concluding note and borrowing the jargon of the comedy circuit, I asked xe2x80x9cIs this anything?xe2x80x9d Thatxe2x80x99s the title Jerry Seinfeld gave to his recent book, and he tells us it is a way comedians have of asking each other whether there was any promise in an early iteration of a joke or routine. Well, the results are in, and they are pretty conclusive:  apparently it was something. I was actually surprised by the volume of emails that started coming in almost immediately. Ixe2x80x99d say 97/100 were quite enthusiastic about the prospect of seeing some of these brief posts a bit more frequently. In fact, I was more convinced after reading some of the rationale a number of you offered for their value! The gist being that there is a place for brief, unpolished, and open-ended ideas that would serve as inducements to thought, reflection, and conversation. And, indeed, the feedback Ixe2x80x99ve gotten to the content of the post definitely bears this out. So, I like this development and will begin to play with the form. As I suggested, xe2x80x9cIs this anything?xe2x80x9d is actually a great heading for this subset of posts xe2x80xa6 only not for jokes but for ideas. The Post-it note has been my default medium for such things, and occasionally Twitter, but Ixe2x80x99ll begin to occasionally use the newsletter in this way. Ixe2x80x99ll use xe2x80x9cIs this anything?xe2x80x9d as the subtitle whenever I post in this format so that you can tell what to expect when it lands in your inbox. These will not, to be clear, replace the usual longer essays that have been the norm for me. Rather, Ixe2x80x99ll sprinkle these around those longer posts. And I will sprinkle them sparingly. I still donxe2x80x99t want to generate too much noise in your feeds. Also, Ixe2x80x99ve tried to respond, even if just briefly, to everyone who sent in their feedback. Itxe2x80x99s been great to hear from so many of you for the first time. Thanks to all for taking the time to send in your thoughts. That said, there were a lot of emails all stacked into the same thread in the inbox, so forgive me if Ixe2x80x99ve missed a reply here and there. Finally, it occurs to me that, judging from other newsletters I read, my use of the xe2x80x9cSubscribexe2x80x9d button has been remarkably restrained. So, if I may, the Convivial Society operates on a patronage model:  no paywall, just the confidence that those who are able and find value in the work will find it worth supporting. If thatxe2x80x99s you and youxe2x80x99ve been on the fence, I will say this would be a great time to consider a paid subscription:I feel compelled these days to assure everyone that, unlike some others apparently, Ixe2x80x99m not exactly getting rich on here, just getting by. Also, if you have reservations about this platform and would be interested in other ways of supporting the work, one possibility might be picking up a copy of an e-book of collected essays from the old blog and choosing your price as you saw fit. Youxe2x80x99re of course more than welcome to download a copy for free, too. Okay, I promise that will be the last bit of subscription-talk for a while!Regular programming resumes next week with (finally) the second part of a two-part reconsideration of how Ixe2x80x99ve thought about the problem of attention and digital media. Herexe2x80x99s the first part, in case you missed it. As always, my hope is that this finds you well.

Digital media seems to suggest immateriality, as does the language we use to talk about it:  virtual reality, cyberspace, the cloud. Likewise, we are tempted to imagine that our use of digital media puts us in a state of disembodiment. Therexe2x80x99s something to this, but the language of disembodiment is not the best way to describe whatxe2x80x99s going on. After all, we never actually leave our bodies when we use digital media. Perhaps itxe2x80x99s best to think of it as a different mode of embodimentxe2x80x94one characterized by telepresence, a condition in which our immediate experience is not confined to the physical location of our bodies. In a discussion that has nothing to do with technology, the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre wrote about a tendency to become xe2x80x9cforgetful of our bodies.xe2x80x9d Perhaps thatxe2x80x99s a good way of putting this tendency to assume that digital culture is immaterial and disembodied. We never leave our bodies when we are immersed in digitally mediated experiences, but we might be tempted to disregard our flesh and its significance. MacIntyre mentions this forgetfulness in a book titled Dependent Rational Animals. In it he argues that this forgetfulness of the body leads us to ignore how thoroughly dependent we are as creatures, especially in childhood and old age but also under countless other circumstances throughout our lives. As the title suggests, MacIntyre was interested in putting this dependence at the center of how we think about what it means to be human, and thus at the center of our thinking about the virtues to which we ought to aspire.As I thought about this and how digital media seems to encourage the myth of immateriality and disembodiment, it occurred to me that this might be an interesting clue as to the source of the worst elements of our digital public spacesTo forget the body is to forget our dependence, our frailty, our limitations. To forget these is also to forget the value, indeed the necessity of humility, generosity, care, patience, and mercy. These and other like them are what MacIntyre called xe2x80x9cthe virtues of acknowledged dependence,xe2x80x9d and they were, in his view, grounded in a recognition of our limitations and weaknesses as embodied creatures. If digital culture tempts us to forget our bodies, then it may also be prompting us to act as if we were self-sufficient beings with little reason to care or expect to be cared for by another. ShareJerry Seinfeld recently published a book titled Is This Anything? Apparently this is how comedians ask whether therexe2x80x99s any potential in a joke theyxe2x80x99re working on. I thought about that as I drafted this uncharacteristically brief post (under 500 words!). So, I ask you, is this anything? By which I mean, do you find any value in it as a reader? Would you want more short reflections of this sort coming in with a bit more frequency alongside the longer installments, or would you rather I stick to the longer essay format and keep it to two or three emails a month? It occurred to me, too, that xe2x80x9cIs this anything?xe2x80x9d is a good title for what this format could be:  not a joke, but a line of thought, offered in the same spirit, to see if, as a good friend of mine likes to say, it does any work for you. Thoughts? Ixe2x80x99d be glad to hear them. Hit reply, and let me know. Also, given the brevity of the post, I opted not to provide an audio version, but, if that would still be helpful to some of you moving forward, please let me know.

But as my life has filled up with busyness in recent years, I've been trying to come to terms with what sometimes feels like the self-parody of my education. The books on my shelf which I've read are starting to resemble the ones I haven't, and I sometimes I doubt whether they taught me anything. This disembodied model of knowing makes the failure of memory seems personal rather than simply how the human body functions. I persistently assume learning means knowing, attributing knowledge and understanding to my character, regardless of time spent in the constant practice of reading and thinking. Then, characteristically, I have to constantly relearn the lesson that routine and ritual undergird identity, that patterns of attention train patterns in what tends to occur to me, etc. I think it's great to plant a flag here for deeper dives. It's a rich topic, which you can take in a lot of directions. It occurs to me that one downside of the newsletter as compared to the blog is the ability to index big subjects like embodiment, which you've written about or alluded to in many other pieces. Of course, it's likewise nice to focus on one piece at a time without the pressure of dozens of linked references looming behind it. I still have your last entry in mind: endless information fosters anxiety over the pressure toward an ever-elusive comprehensiveness. I think the real challenge with digitally mediated interactions, especially with strangers, isn't so much forgetting our own embodiment but that of others. If we're communicating with people we know, we at least have a memory of them and their bodies in time and space. But if we're communicating with strangers on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, we lack that memory. The database for facial expressions, voice inflections, characteristic gestures, etc is empty. Their typed words that appear on the screen before us, then, become the only data that we can respond to. The words easily \"become\" the person. Disembodiment applies not to us but to our experience of the words in a post or a comment or a tweet. I guess that's what emboldens or enables people to type the most insane things at one another. Video (like Zoom), on the other hand, can help us overcome that forgetfulness of a stranger's embodiment, as those of us who can see are able to visualize the faces and bodies of the ones we're speaking to.No posts","title":"Forgetting the Body  - The Convivial Society","url":"https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/forgetting-the-body"}

Gokul is one of the most passionate scientists Ixe2x80x99ve ever met, and you can always learn something from his enthusiasm even if you donxe2x80x99t fully understand the details of his work.I do science sometimes. I'm currently a senior at UC Berkeley, but I have a very broad scientific experience. What that means is Ixe2x80x99ve done projects with significant depth in biomaterials, drug delivery, bioinformatics, and medicinal chemistry, as well as astrophysics. Ixe2x80x99ve been lucky to learn from mentors and collaborators in different fields.So I've kind of got a very wide-ranging focus in my science, and all of that comes together in every project. We incorporate chemistry and physics ideas in biomaterials projects, as well as drug delivery projects. Ixe2x80x99m fundamentally a scientist at heart.Ixe2x80x99m also pretty social and love to meet new people, so DM me on Twitter or send me an email (gokulkannan21@berkeley.edu) for more info/more in-depth discussion!Click to DM GokulThe idea behind our work in antivirals was originally spawned from us reading Dr. Todd Riderxe2x80x99s 2011 paper on DRACOs, but we realized there are details that still have to be developed for viability. DRACO is a protein-based therapeutic that selectively induces cell death in cells containing viral RNA. They wanted to use it as a prophylactic therapy, where you take the DRACOs and itxe2x80x99ll stop you from getting a sustained infection.Chemically and biologically, there are a lot of challenges to overcome. However, the idea of killing an infected cell is dope.And then we thought, can we restore the body's function to naturally kill infected cells? Because that's what your cells want to do. If they're infected, they self-destruct. But they can't because the virus stops it. So by restoring that function, we can nuke the virally infected cells and cure the virus in theory.We found that concept exciting and got to thinking about those other approaches, initially based on a 1999 Nature Medicine paper from HHMI and WashU St. Louis, from Dr. Steven Dowdyxe2x80x99s group. They used modified caspase-3 proteins to kill HIV cells in culture, using a xe2x80x9cTrojan Horsexe2x80x9d strategy wexe2x80x99re trying to take advantage of. Since 1999, science has gotten a lot better at drug delivery. Wexe2x80x99re reframing what was previously a super hard delivery problem into a more tractable one, and also putting new spins on that xe2x80x9899 Nature Medicine method. Thatxe2x80x99s what really takes this cell-killing idea to the next level and makes it a transformative platform technology.How would we go about this?Well, because the virus blocks cell death, we need to start the cell death process at a very late stage. Wexe2x80x99re targeting one of the last steps in the apoptotic processxe2x80x94so deep that itxe2x80x99s hard for the virus to reach it.Herexe2x80x99s an awesome video of human cancer cells undergoing apoptosis.And then by activating that process, we can kill the infected cells. This reorients the idea from a preventative one to a curative one, where we provide the machinery necessary for the cell to self-destruct.The viruses need what are called proteases, which are processing proteins. These proteases basically act like scissorsxe2x80x94they cut up other proteins and trim them to the right side to fit and help the virus propagate.Caspasexe2x80x94which is the protein we're targetingxe2x80x94normally exists in what's called a procaspase form. This procaspase form is 2 symmetrical units connected by a linker peptide. That linker peptide gets caught and then the caspase activates.By engineering that linker peptide to get caught by the viral protease (the scissors), the virus itself activates the cell death process. Itxe2x80x99s pretty elegantxe2x80x94the virus is activating a booby trap to bring the whole house down and kill the cell and the viruses along with it.My parents co-founded Ashvattha Therapeutics. Theyxe2x80x99ve actually got a nanomedicine in clinical trials for the cytokine storm hyperinflammation (and potentially neuroinflammation) from COVID right now. Theyxe2x80x99re working on neuroinflammation associated with several neurological disorders.Itxe2x80x99s kind of exciting because my parents have always been outsiders to the biotech community, in some ways. Theyxe2x80x99re both immigrants and didnxe2x80x99t have it easy getting to where they were, so watching them go through an absurd amount of difficulty bringing their work to the clinic has been both an inspiration and a source of learning for me. They spent more than a decade building quietly from scratch, and itxe2x80x99s now starting to show up in a huge way.Ixe2x80x99ve gotten a front-row seat to what successful drug development looks like. In fact, they probably have one of the most pre-clinically robust data on their platform that anyone has ever had for a clinical-stage product. So watching them build out such a rigorous base of proof for their work has been awesome, and I think that carries over to all of my work and my desire to make sure that everything is safe for people and making sure I understand how stuff works.I run a journal club on the Gen Z Mafia server, which is a way to get a scope of who's into biotech and life sciences, especially as well as just generally deep tech. A journal club is like a book club, but we discuss scientific journal articles instead of books.Knowing a specific niche subject area is very different from keeping up with the frontier of literature across a larger field.Youxe2x80x99ll often find, especially with Gen Z, people who know a lot about a very specific field. Thatxe2x80x99s not a bad thing, but what ends up happening is youxe2x80x99ll get a form of tunnel vision that can lead to oversights, especially in a field like life sciences, where you have very high-dimensional problems of the human body.Therefore, itxe2x80x99s important to keep a broad overview of everything thatxe2x80x99s going on, and thatxe2x80x99s what wexe2x80x99re trying to get at with a journal club. Wexe2x80x99re also targeting people with no experience with science at all who want to develop critical scientific thinking.I recently put out a paper in astrochemistry with my mentor Dr. Richard Saykally and some friends.We like to think that scientists have a very good picture of how the universe kind of came to be like, post-big bang.But the truth is, scientists are still building a picture of the first few hundred million years, and one of the major gaps in our knowledge is how the very first stars cooled and formed.If you remember the ideal gas law from high school physics, PV = nRT.You've got this massive cloud of super-hot gas and dust. But stars are way denser than that and yet theyxe2x80x99re formed from that cloud. So for this stuff to condense, it had to cool. As V decreases, so does T. The only way it can cool is by radiation, by releasing light. And each of those photons that get released, carries away with it some energy.We think one way this could have happened is via a hydrogen-based mechanism. Where the H2 molecule helps cool the star by sending away light. But these stars had to cool to something on the order of 50 to 100 Kelvin at most. Otherwise, they would have formed a black hole instead. And we know that stars formed first.That presents an issue because molecular hydrogen cooling sucks at low temperatures. Itxe2x80x99s just terrible. But wexe2x80x99ve accepted it anyway because we canxe2x80x99t find a better explanation. We proposed this mechanism using a class of molecules called Rydberg molecules, including a molecule called H3xe2x80x94triatomic hydrogen.At first glance, this makes no sense, but it (and a couple of similar molecules) form quite nicely in these types of primordial gas environments. We proposed that high-energy Rydberg states of H3 and other types of exotic, or previously thought exotic molecules, like helium hydride drove the cooling of the early stars instead of just H2.If we're right, that means now we can align the timescale that we're pretty sure the stars formed with how those stars actually did. What this does help us understand is the missing piece in the cosmological puzzle of how the first stars really came to be.When we wrote the astrochemistry paper, it was very serendipitous in terms of Dr. Saykally being my intro chem professor, and then also digging up some of his old data that nobodyxe2x80x99s touched since 2015.A lot of scientific breakthroughs are accidents or come from weird interactions. Even in biology, a lot of the field emerged by accident. We just need to be observant and think creatively, and the pieces will eventually start to fit together at very weird times.Professor Jennifer Doudna was not looking for gene editing when she discovered CRISPR. In fact, she was originally recruited to Berkeley because of her work on structural biology. Completely different.But she was very excited about bacteria. Having gone to a few of her talks, I think itxe2x80x99s amazing and inspiring how much she really loves this fundamental study. And from that, she was able to discover this repurposed gene-editing mechanism.And obviously, therexe2x80x99s the canonical story that everybody tells us about penicillin, where it was a pure accident where the breakthrough came out of just observing that accident.A large part of it is about being observant and creative, and not necessarily accepting the easiest explanation when things donxe2x80x99t really check out.Dr. Sanjay Kumar is my faculty mentor (shout out to Joe and Kayla for being my amazing direct mentors), and his group was really where I grew into a very solid, rigorous researcher.In the Kumar lab, Ixe2x80x99ve really been able to develop a really good sense of rigor and ensure that everything I put out is as well-proven as possible. The research Ixe2x80x99ve done there is related to understanding the mechanisms of cancer migration.Glioblastoma is among the worst cancers. Pretty much everybody with it dies. And the reason for that is because of recurrence. You get glioblastoma, you get treated for it, and surprise: two years later, itxe2x80x99s back and worse. This is caused by what we call proneural to mesenchymal transition (the glioma analogue to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition), or at least we think so now.So your initial glioblastoma cells go into overdrive. They get super aggressive and run all over the place. And then they start to see new secondary tumors. These new secondary tumors are what cause death later on.Wexe2x80x99ve been developing hydrogels and micro-devices to understand how and why these glioblastoma cells move (beautifully described in Kaylaxe2x80x99s recent review). Thanks to these, wexe2x80x99ve learned about not only the properties of migration itself but also xe2x80x9cswitchesxe2x80x9d that might be able to turn on and off that movement.Our overall goal is to find the legs of these moving cells and figure out how to cut them off. If the cells canxe2x80x99t run away, the secondary tumors canxe2x80x99t form, and killing the first tumor will be enough. Our big step towards this is with hydrogel models and the subsequent understanding of how glioblastoma moves and acts.I had very good mentorship and ended up hitting the right pieces of luck along the way to get excited about science. A large part of why Ixe2x80x99m able to work on this antiviral stuff and start these projects is because I got excited early and stayed excited about science itself over time.I co-founded The Youth Project in the US, and our overall mission is to ensure that young people around the world get the resources they need to make change around them. We focus on helping people make change in their localized areas, whether thatxe2x80x99s through funding projects or running specific initiatives.For example, I taught an engineering and robotics course at an orphanage in India, and the students from that course went on to participate in competitive events. And that was really exciting just to be able to watch them go from no engineering knowledge to being able to qualify and compete against highly-ranked schools.The Youth Project has also built schools and sports clubs in India, helped homeless people find stable jobs and affordable housing across the US, and more. This is a way of extending my resources and helping people how I can, while also recognizing that I got really lucky. The more people that are excited about science and get into science, the better the field gets. More creative people working on biology means we do better biology.In some cases, wexe2x80x99re kind of stuck with the formality of biology and the dozens of names you need to memorize. In some subfields, it is what it is. But how I generally approach biology and chemistryxe2x80x94and how I would highly recommend everybody at least try this outxe2x80x94is to think from a physics perspective.Instead of thinking from a pure biology perspective, approach the field like you would physics. If we look at Science on a scale, one of the most empirical sciences is biology and the least empirical science is math. Everything else exists on a spectrum.The closer we get to the theory side and establishing things as low dimensional, understandable systems, the more we can predict and understand what happens.For biology, a lot of the time, the only way to truly know something is to empirically prove it.No one knew that adenosine kinase phosphorylates NAD until somebody literally observed adenosine kinase and found out that it phosphorylates NAD. But in math, you can just prove stuff based on other principles completely and entirely, and thatxe2x80x99s rigorous and thorough. Itxe2x80x99s easy to say in biology that you donxe2x80x99t know something because we donxe2x80x99t have the data. But even if itxe2x80x99s wrong, I feel like itxe2x80x99s better to say we donxe2x80x99t have the data, and then explain how something is most likely going to work based on the physical principles and assumptions we made earlier.If your assumptions are right, then youxe2x80x99re right. More often than not youxe2x80x99re wrong and you fail, but it is what it is.With understanding and modeling biological systems as physical systems, part of it is figuring out what assumptions you can make and what details you can abstract away to understand it like a physical system.The TLDR is to take these complex systems,Make assumptions to simplify the parts that we care about Build model systems based on physical principles to understand themValidate the models with others or clinical data and iterateProfit (and more importantly, improve human health)There's a lot of spaces to get involved, and it really depends on what stage you want to.For example, computer science has gotten more and more heavily integrated with biotech recently. Whether itxe2x80x99s on the molecular dynamics and simulation side, which actually is quite a bit of physics as well, or like -omics or big data and dealing with massive RNA or protein sequencing datasets.Therexe2x80x99s a place for everyone. It doesnxe2x80x99t matter what your existing expertise is. If you want to start at the ground level, itxe2x80x99s important to have a fundamental understanding of how biological and chemical processes work.I would recommend building a niche of knowledge around one fundamental scientific subject. For example, if itxe2x80x99s chemistry, take some intro to chem classes, look through Khan Academy, and stuff on YouTube to get a good understanding of fundamental chemistry.And then from there, you can start applying those same principles to understanding biological and physical systems. Every other science gets easier to learn once you know at least one fundamental science because youxe2x80x99ve got a framework or lens to view it through.Or you could read a textbook if thatxe2x80x99s your thing. I personally hate textbooks, but a favorite is Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat, and Mass Transfer by Welty, Wicks, and Wilson. I remember the whole thing because I like it so much.There's always some inherent risk until you try a drug in humans. Therexe2x80x99s a risk that either your animal model doesn't reflect what happens, your drug doesn't hit the thing you thought it would, it goes to the wrong spot, etc. There are a million things that could fail.Itxe2x80x99s a game of mitigating as much of that risk as possible. You also need to acknowledge that you could spend your entire life trying things outside the clinic and in animals all you want, but at some point, you just need to put the drug in a person.Wexe2x80x99re actually getting quite good at mitigating risk now. Not good enough, but getting better. We have things like organoid models, where we basically build out an organ on a chipxe2x80x94like a heart or a liver on a chip, and then test a drug on that chip and see how that metabolizes and acts on what is basically a tiny human liver.This lets us study an extremely multifunctional liver that we would normally never be able to replicate. And it helps us dissect that and understand exactly what happens. So one example of mitigating risk is developing a deep mechanistic understanding of the lab.Another way is by developing animal models. There are a ton of animal models for most things, and there are no animal models for many things. For example, Alzheimer's is very spicy. Everyone's excited about it, but our animal models arenxe2x80x99t actually representative. Therefore, most drugs that go into trials fail.There are a few canonical hypotheses youxe2x80x99ll hear about Alzheimerxe2x80x99s, whether itxe2x80x99s tau tangles or amyloid beta deposits. Of the few major ones now, most of those have some aspects that are wrong because wexe2x80x99ve targeted them, hit them, and they failed. If we had a good Alzheimerxe2x80x99s animal model, we would be a lot better off. But we donxe2x80x99t have a good animal model because animals donxe2x80x99t get Alzheimerxe2x80x99s.Itxe2x80x99s about finding the right models, both in-lab and in animals, to really mitigate the risk. But therexe2x80x99s always going to be some inherent risk, and therexe2x80x99s always a chance youxe2x80x99ll lose a couple hundred million on a massive trial that goes nowhere.Investors are generally looking for 2 things: How much have you de-risked this? What is the market potential, either through therapeutic development and a clinical trial success or (more likely) an exit by big pharma?Big Pharma acquires a lot, and they acquire big. Youxe2x80x99ll see a startup get excited about being acquired for $100M. But in biotech, itxe2x80x99s like damn, only $100M? Gilead has acquired 4-5 companies in 2020xe2x80x94the last one was $21 billion. The one before was like $5 billion. And these arenxe2x80x99t exceptions. Exits are really the go-to and itxe2x80x99s important to keep in mind someone you can sell to.In terms of early-stage fundraising, every company is different. People might be asking more questions about the core science, like:Do you understand the delivery of your drug? Where does it need to go? How does it act in each area? Can you get it where it needs to go initially? How potent is it? If itxe2x80x99s not potent enough, youxe2x80x99ll see no effect unless you give too much of it. How much have you de-risked this in animal models? The earlier stage you are, the vaguer it gets. But right now, therexe2x80x99s no way to have true product-market fit in the same way you would look for it in a tech company.It's just science, which I like a lot. In terms of building the core scientific team, I tend to be most concerned about finding people who approach problems in the right ways and have the right expertise to complement your own. Our team is currently 3 people: Me, Praneeth, and JZ. I bring fundamental drug development and drug delivery knowledge, along with very strong experience in biomaterials and tissue engineering, chemistry, and bioinformaticsPraneeth brings a super-extensive knowledge of animal models and really solid cell/molecular biology experience. This guy does like 90 mouse experiments on the reg, itxe2x80x99s just casual for him.JZ helps us translate this and get it out there in terms of raising money, getting in touch with the right people, and helping us build out everywhere except the science. Hexe2x80x99s absolutely crushed it leading Matrix.Praneeth and I really gel well on the science because he also approaches these problems from a physics and engineering perspective, as opposed to just a biology perspective. Ixe2x80x99m not too afraid of making a couple of assumptions to simplify a complex landscape, and neither is Praneeth.I would encourage everyone building a team to find people who approach the problem in the same way youxe2x80x99d like to while filling gaps in your experience that you can learn from.What's important is to understand the high-level impact and a general conceptual understanding of how it worksxe2x80x94drop the names. Biology can be so semantic, and therexe2x80x99s so much youxe2x80x99ve got to know to get a thorough understanding of something. But you donxe2x80x99t need an understanding of every single nitty-gritty bit to learn and apply different ideas.Itxe2x80x99s important to convey conceptual and mechanistic understanding. For example, in Modernaxe2x80x99s mRNA vaccines, the mRNA carries a message to produce this protein, and then your immune cells will recognize and develop immunity against that protein after it gets produced.This is a very high-level conceptual understanding of the mRNA vaccine process, and itxe2x80x99s accurate enough to build other ideas on top of. For example, youxe2x80x99re able to think: if we can send a message with mRNA for vaccines, maybe we can send messages with mRNA for other things. Like antivirals. Surprise, thatxe2x80x99s what wexe2x80x99re doing.Wexe2x80x99re planning on taking this core mRNA idea, a concept very beautifully proven by Moderna, into a new space with quite a bit of exciting new science wexe2x80x99ve applied to it.The most exciting emerging field, to me, is PROTACs. These are awesome. Theyxe2x80x99re proteolysis targeting chimeras. You mightxe2x80x99ve heard of thalidomide, which was a drug in the 50s and 60s that caused birth defects in babies when it was given to pregnant women for morning sickness. Later, people found out that that thalidomide is something we call a molecular glue.A molecular glue takes a degrader protein and another protein and sticks them together.In thalidomide, it took the protein necessary for limb formation and tied it together with a degrader protein. So the degrader protein degraded the limb formation protein, and babies were born without limbs.Now, thatxe2x80x99s kind of a spicy mechanism. We donxe2x80x99t want to destroy limb formation, but we can use it for other things. Herexe2x80x99s the really solid benefit:Normally, for each protein you want to target, you need a small molecule to inhibit it. A small-molecule inhibitor, normally a drug, just sticks to protein and blocks it up until the protein dies.With a PROTAC, you actually cause protein death. So you drag the degrading protein over your protein of interest, and boom. Gone. Drag it over to the next one, and itxe2x80x99s gone. So you keep destroying these proteins, and you can get a high potency on top of that. Therexe2x80x99s this idea you can target proteins you canxe2x80x99t normally hit other ways. Therexe2x80x99s a variety of proteins we call undruggable. And PROTACs actually offer us the potential to drug those undruggable proteins.Itxe2x80x99s still really emerging in the clinical landscape. Itxe2x80x99s very much a medicinal chemistry thingxe2x80x94I havenxe2x80x99t seen much of it outside of the medicinal chemistry and biopharma community. But therexe2x80x99s definitely an undertone of excitement about these things.Developing high-density, 3D-printed tissue is an emerging and kinda underrated area of research. The goal is to 3D print dense tissue nicely. The real end goal of most bioprinting is to develop transplantable, off-the-shelf organs, where if someone needs a heart or a liver you can just print it out and give it to the patient right now.The problem is that we canxe2x80x99t print up to requisite densities. And we especially canxe2x80x99t do so with any nicely vascularized tissue so that nutrients can reach everywhere. There are a number of labs working on those vascularization and density problems.The development of organoids is also extremely cool. Not only for the problem of off-the-shelf organs, but itxe2x80x99s also heavily applied to drug testing or applications where you can start to build out an organ in a dish.And one of the really beautiful things about this is in some cases, you can simply give nature the initial seed and let it go. If you seed an organoid just the right way, it can actually progress and form the full organoid itself without too much intervention. We can then study biology in those organoids and relate that to human biology beautifully.One of my favorite scientistsxe2x80x94and my mentor this summer (paper coming out soon!)xe2x80x94 is Dr. Takanori Takebe, at Cincinnati Childrenxe2x80x99s Hospital and Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Hexe2x80x99s an actual god when it comes to this and does truly transformative work.Tying it back to physical principles, I believe that the vast majority of biological problems can be simplified using the right assumptions and the right models into physically understandable systems.I want to find those systems, model them, and then build therapeutics to treat those diseases.In the case of viral disease, our company is basically able to simplify complex viral disease into a very straightforward, simple thesis. I think this methodology can be applied across many fields using what we call platform technologies.With our company, we donxe2x80x99t just want to cure one viral disease. The concept wexe2x80x99re working with applies to the vast majority of other viral diseasesxe2x80x94we can hit everything that has a protease.So building these platform technologies lets us solve a ton of problems at the same time.I want to build platform technologies to treat entire classes of diseases.

Previously, he was VP of business development at Martin Bionics. Garrett was kind enough to share some insights on hyperlogistics, building fast, and some of the engineering process behind Pipedream.My namexe2x80x99s Garrett, Ixe2x80x99m the CEO of Pipedream. Pipedream is a Hyperloop for packagesxe2x80x94a really fast underground delivery network. We donxe2x80x99t know where the first Pipedream will be built yet, but there are a lot of interesting ideas on where the best application for one is right now. And really what wexe2x80x99re looking for with the first implementation is somewhere we can build quickly:All private landA high volume of usagePackages arenxe2x80x99t high-riskFor Phase 1, wexe2x80x99re looking for a campus where everything being moved around is low-risk so if it doesnxe2x80x99t end up through our system in 30 seconds, therexe2x80x99s another way to get that item.We see delivery evolving towards an end state that we call hyperlogistics. Your experience with Pipedream changes depending on how close we are to that end state.Hyperlogistics is just like the internet, but for physical objects instead of pure information. It shares features with the internet, including:Routing. Youxe2x80x99ll have a physical router and nodes on the system where youxe2x80x99re putting in deliveries and sending them outBidirectionality. If therexe2x80x99s anything that the user is sending back, youxe2x80x99ll accept it through that same router. You have bi-directional interaction with the consumer at a node.Wexe2x80x99re not quite at that stage yet. If you move closer to where we're at now, our first big implementation will be creating portals between districts in a city.Let's say therexe2x80x99s this grilled cheese restaurantxe2x80x94let's call it Cheesy Joe'sxe2x80x94and they have a lot of grilled cheese sandwiches they need to get all over the city. The way it works right now, DoorDash is dispatching a driver to go and grab this grilled cheese from Cheesy Joe's. That driver is driving five districts North to a neighborhood and dropping off that order at a person's house. Theyxe2x80x99re sitting in a two-ton vehicle and probably for 45 minutes, we have paid a human being to go and pick up a single sandwich and drop it off at someone's house. And it's a big jokexe2x80x94we all know those economics are tough because I pay delivery fees that are double the price of that sandwich.But it works for food because it's already a high-margin product and Ixe2x80x99ll pay a premium for it since I don't want to drive all the way to the restaurant.The way we would use Pipedream in that situation is we have these portals in each district. So if the restaurant has 10 grilled cheese sandwiches that need to go all over the city, a GrubHub driver would come to pick up all ten grilled cheese sandwiches, take them to the nearest portal station. Pipedream moves those orders at high speed to different portals near the end userxe2x80x99s house where they're batched with other deliveries from around the city and a driver comes, picks up that whole batch, and then delivers it to the individual people's houses.The portals are just to make intra-city delivery more efficient, eliminate cart minimums, and reduce the amount of time it takes to make those deliveries. Wexe2x80x99re taking existing systems, making them more efficient, and supercharging them. This also opens up the ability to transition cities to completely autonomous delivery.We have technologies that could make a city fully autonomous right nowxe2x80x94sidewalk robots, drones, ZipLine. They're just not long-range or quick enough. But if they're only interacting with those individual portals in the district, then they only need to do that last half-mile to 400 meters. And that's something that they could handle today. So we think that's currently the most interesting use case, eventually building up to a future where everyone's connected to this network. But the five-year goal is just getting those districts connected through high-speed tunnels.10-20 years from now, you'll have a door in your house that connects directly to Pipedream. If everyone on our team dies and Pipedream doesn't exist, you'll still have that door. It is a certainty of logistics that you will have this magical cupboard, where ordering something online and getting it delivered to that cupboard is just as easy as going to any other cupboard in your house and grabbing what you need. We just think we can be the first to make it a reality.I like Lean Startup. Therexe2x80x99s nothing wrong with it. I think where we're at with SaaS right now, there are so many tools to build software that if you want to make $100M, you can just do the lean startup model and build a software company. Thatxe2x80x99s awesome.But that ultimately, it's just too iterative. A lot of the innovation we need requires a paradigm shift. Hyperlogistics, by definition, is a complete leapfrog of technologies from where we are in logistics right now to where wexe2x80x99re going.So the lean startup model doesn't workxe2x80x94we don't want to iterate on logistics. There needs to be a step-change in logistics, and you donxe2x80x99t get there by making existing technology 10% better.We took a different path with Pipedream. Usually, we'll come up with an idea and build the easiest, quickest MVP. We can just get something and build it and get it out there. But we took a much longer, more thoughtful approach here.We really started with the idea and the end goal in mind:With teleportation as the end state, what's something that we could do that's a little more plausible today than teleportation, but gets you almost all the benefits of teleporting objects? We call this new industry hyperlogistics. What is a version of that we could get done this decade?We took a first-principles approach to building a hyperlogistics company. We started with the end goal and looked at:What technologies are missing that would make this possible?What can existing technologies can we stitch together?We think that low-cost tunnels are needed to make hyperlogistics possible. And wexe2x80x99re building to prove our assumptions wrong right now and just making sure that everything works like we think itxe2x80x99s going to need to. But if it ends up not being that, itxe2x80x99s okay. We can pivot. Everything is focused on just building towards that end goal.I tried digging test tunnels in my backyard and just do like a little circle, but ultimately, my backyard is not very big, so that circle got pretty small.  I actually dug tunnels out in the middle of nowhere, and just put a long 100m test track there with a trencher.A trencher is this giant chainsaw on a little car and then you drop it down and it just chainsaws the dirt up. And you just draw it down in a line and then you put your pipe in that trench that you just dug and then you put the dirt back over it. When I explain it, it sounds super easy for one guy digging the trench. But it took me forever. It was super hard. Wexe2x80x99re definitely focusing on storytelling when talking to customersxe2x80x94although you still need to back up your storytelling from the engineering side. Pipedream is such a different use case than what governments are used to talking about, so itxe2x80x99s really about convincing them of the benefits of a system like this.What wexe2x80x99re really doing is eradicating personal ownership of things and moving all tools and consumables to the rental economy, and thatxe2x80x99s not super obvious. A lot of what we do is also detailing the ramifications of what wexe2x80x99re doing.Sometimes I can tell when people are asking the right questions and therexe2x80x99s an incubation period of the idea where you donxe2x80x99t really understand it the first time you talk about it.But if they've asked the right questions and then they think about it for a few days, they always call back in like, xe2x80x9cOh my goodness. I thought of like a million things that are going to change once we realize this future.xe2x80x9d I love the engineering process and that's what attracted me to work at Martin Bionics before Pipedream. A lot of the technology development process around prosthetics was centered around questions like, how do you make a knee better? How do you give it more intelligence? How do you make it aware of the ground? How do you make it communicate better with the person, make it more usable, and make the battery last longer?And Martin Bionics took a really counter-intuitive approach. In talking to people, they discovered the biggest problem people had with prosthetics was how they fit onto their limbs. There needs to be an interface between the machine and the body, and everyone thought a hard rigid socket was the best design. And Martin Bionics said, can we make a socket from pliable materials?They took this really big, hard problem and they said, let's just keep iterating and designing until we find the most pliable socket we can create. And that is ultimately what attracted me to them is they were doing something really hard with a huge impact that has never been tried before.I learned a lot about the engineering process, iteration, pivoting the business model, etc. from working there, and I took those learnings and applied them to Pipedream.If you look at a lot of the paradigm shifts wexe2x80x99ve had in industries like space or computing, it comes from outsiders who take a unique perspective on something experts say isnxe2x80x99t possible, and say xe2x80x9cOkay, letxe2x80x99s try to find the most possible variant of this idea.xe2x80x9dNot by theorizing, but actually building it and seeing why itxe2x80x99s not possible. I always love this story about the physicists who said Elon Musk landing rockets was a fool's errand and he had no experience in the space industry. I love the story about the New York Times article that said we were millions of years away from human flight, then a few months later the Wright brothers built their first aircraft.The same thing happened with prosthetics. Jay Martin, the founder of Martin Bionics, got a grant to pursue the pliable socket idea and hired a team of experts. Three months in, they were all like, xe2x80x9cwexe2x80x99re not going to be able to do this.xe2x80x9d So he fired them, hired a bunch of college interns, and they built it. They didnxe2x80x99t have any sticking points of perspective. They had a dream, a lot of hope, and the engineering process to iterate until they built something that worked.I donxe2x80x99t have any experience in tunneling. And I think thatxe2x80x99s good because wexe2x80x99re not focused on tunneling. Wexe2x80x99re actually focused on making hyperlogistics possible. I think if I was an expert in tunneling and we found a reason that tunneling wouldnxe2x80x99t work, I would be way less likely to pivot away from that.The only thing we care about is making hyperlogistics possible and sticking to a really fast iteration cycle in our engineering process.We were talking to a ton of experts while also building things in parallel. Experts have a lot of experience and industry knowledge. You just need to be really careful about the advice you choose to take from them.A stumbling block for young engineers and young entrepreneurs is they reach out to experts and they take all their advice. You definitely have to filter the advice that you get from those experts and understand the mental biases they have when giving you that advice.But therexe2x80x99s still a lot to learn from experts. Usually, when Ixe2x80x99m talking to a logistics expert, theyxe2x80x99re like, xe2x80x9cOh yeah, this would be great if it were possible.xe2x80x9d Okay, thatxe2x80x99s fair. So maybe itxe2x80x99s not possible, but the next question to ask isxe2x80x94how could it be possible?What specific problems are we going to run into when implementing this? Help us get to those problems youxe2x80x99ve seen in the past. We donxe2x80x99t want to repeat any mistakes. We want to make new mistakes.My co-founder and I were college roommates. I think it's a classic story. We were college roommates freshman year and stayed roommates all four years of college. I think you can over-optimize on finding the perfect team. The metaphorical yin to your yang in a co-founder. But the most important thing about having a good cofounder is the same as having a spousexe2x80x94you need good, efficient communication and a lot of trust in each other.You're making a lot of decisions really fast. You need to be able to communicate and understand when the other person needs help or when theyxe2x80x99re falling into an old habit and you should be able to help them with that. Ixe2x80x99m also honored to have him as a co-founder since hexe2x80x99s the smartest engineer Ixe2x80x99ve ever met. Absolutely brilliant. We have a lot of history and trust built up. The great thing about my co-founder, Drew, is he knows so much. Not to oversimplify it, but we have a Jobs-Wozniak type relationship, where he is really an engineer and Ixe2x80x99m a little more visionary.But hexe2x80x99s also really creative. If I have an idea thatxe2x80x99s kind of crazy or out of the box, hexe2x80x99s really good at saying xe2x80x9cThatxe2x80x99s probably not going to work, but herexe2x80x99s how we could break down this big idea and make it possible. Let's build it and find the reason why it doesn't work.xe2x80x9d Thatxe2x80x99s super-valuable to have in a co-founder. He's my favorite person to work with. I was meeting a lot of entrepreneurs and people with ideas where they wanted to build this thing, whether it was an app, a website, or a physical product. And they were always waiting to raise money so they could hire a technical co-founder. Or maybe they had a dev shop that they wanted to bring on or an agency that was going to build it for them. They had this mental barrier of xe2x80x9cI need someone else to do what I want to doxe2x80x9d and sometimes thatxe2x80x99s true. I love the current state of the internet where if you want to do something, you just need to Google it long enough and the internet will bequeath it to you. The information is out there, you just need to look for it.So I set up a bunch of calendar slots on garrettbuildsfast.com because I love brainstorming with people and sayingxe2x80x94okay, you have this thing: Can we walk that back from a feature standpoint to something where you can build it yourself? Can we find a tool that will help you build this thing for cheaper than you think you can?Get help with building fastFor hard tech, therexe2x80x99s a bunch of free tools out there. Onshapexe2x80x94an in-browser CAD toolxe2x80x94will let you have a hobbyist account for free. Itxe2x80x99s really intuitive and you can build whatever you want on it. Then you can just take that design and upload it to Protolabs where theyxe2x80x99ll 3D print it for like 20 bucks and ship it to you. And now you have a prototype.The same thing applies to code. You have tools like Webflow, Memberstack, Airtable, and Bubble that let you build out an entire MVP. It might take a little bit to learn, but youxe2x80x99ll be able to get a product out within a weekend.I love trying to figure out the hack from xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m not technicalxe2x80x9d to xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m going to will this thing into existence.xe2x80x9d And I think people just need help on figuring out the first step, and itxe2x80x99s so much easier to figure it out when youxe2x80x99re brainstorming it with people.I also have a tendency to want to build everything and those brainstorming sessions alleviate that a bit for me and help me stay focused. Talking with other people about their things helps, and I just love it if I could find out what every single person in the world is working on.I love to hear about what people are working on, what theyxe2x80x99re passionate about building. Itxe2x80x99s my favorite thing to do. There are a lot of really interesting projects from those sessions that involve interesting intersections of different creative things. As soon as you hear the idea, youxe2x80x99re like, xe2x80x9cOf course, thatxe2x80x99s going to exist someday.xe2x80x9dIxe2x80x99m working on giving out grants to people working on launching things. Hopefully, itxe2x80x99ll be done in January.I just donxe2x80x99t like how in doing some things, people get really caught up on a $40 domain name, or a certain API they need to pay for to launch what theyxe2x80x99re doing. I want to remove that very small barrier for people to test their ideas.So I said, xe2x80x9call right, wexe2x80x99ll pay for one month of your domain name as long as you build lodge and tasks. And if you keep hitting your KPIs, wexe2x80x99ll keep paying for it until youxe2x80x99re able to bring in enough revenue to pay for it yourself.xe2x80x9dRemoving that $50 monthly barrier for someone launching something theyxe2x80x99ve built is an easy way to really make a difference in a project for some people. Ixe2x80x99ve definitely been there. Ixe2x80x99ve had a couple of things that Ixe2x80x99ve built where Ixe2x80x99m like xe2x80x9cI donxe2x80x99t have $30.xe2x80x9dMay 23rd 2020The day I tweeted that was the day I decided to seriously use Twitter. Growing up, I was taught that it was best to xe2x80x9clet others do the talking for you.xe2x80x9dSo I grew up with the mentality of xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m just going to build and put my things out there, and Ixe2x80x99m not going to talk about it.xe2x80x9d However, I followed KP on Twitter, and his building in public mission and taught me that this mentality was flawed. I needed to be a lighthouse for my mission and attract other people who also want to build towards that.I wanted to pin a tweet that was exactly my mission, very succinctly, that would attract other people to it. And ultimately, that was:I will bring 30 second delivery times to the world this decade, no matter what.That is my decades-long mission.Therexe2x80x99s so much power in visual KPIs. I have a dashboard where I set really small daily goals that are easy to hit. And then over a long period of time, if you do a little bit every day, youxe2x80x99ll have a huge outcome at the end of the year. The dashboard is color-coordinated so you can see at a quick glance if youxe2x80x99re trending in the right direction or not. For setting goals within Pipedream, wexe2x80x99re moving really fast right now. We have big project goals, but we donxe2x80x99t have any KPIs to track. Wexe2x80x99ve just been setting ambitious deadlines and then working backward from those. Ambitious engineers are also perfectionists, and we like to set really big goals. But then when we feel like wexe2x80x99re not accomplishing them, we get stuck in trying to figure out how to make them perfect.So to avoid that, we try to set really aggressive deadlines. And if wexe2x80x99re not able to hit them, we walk what we were trying to get done back until we have something we can get done by that deadline.Itxe2x80x99s been so interesting this year, just the amount of VC money and communities of support that have popped up. I think the more people that are publicly doing ambitious, hard things and telling their story, the faster those crazy ideas will go from fiction to reality.Elon kind of blazed that trail for everyone. Not to be an Elon simp, but he was among the first to:Become obsessed with a really big, ambitious hard tech goalTalk about it nonstopAnd, for the most partxe2x80x94actually pull it offAmbitious founders like Elon have given our generation so much permission to dream big. Founders are saying xe2x80x9chey, Ixe2x80x99m building factories in spacexe2x80x9d and instead of dismissing it as crazy, peoplexe2x80x99s first reaction becomes xe2x80x9cRight on, let me know how I can help.xe2x80x9d The more people that feel comfortable about having those ambitious goals. It may be towards the end of the decade, but I think wexe2x80x99re about to see some sort of Moorexe2x80x99s Law type growth in manufacturing, where itxe2x80x99s going to be easier to build big ambitious hard tech stuff.Side note: this is a sentiment echoed by Justin Glibert in our 3rd interviewI think if we can bring Moorexe2x80x99s law to the physical world, wexe2x80x99re going to see the same set of extremely cool companies and life-changing products we have seen in the information world. And the key to doing that is making manufacturing so much better that we won't even call it manufacturing anymore. Things that seemed fanciful in the early 2000s are starting to seem a lot more reasonable. xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s time to buildxe2x80x9d is something I live by. My Twitter header is xe2x80x9cjust build it.xe2x80x9dIf youxe2x80x99re sitting on what you think is a good idea and donxe2x80x99t overthink it. Just build it, get it out there, and test it. When you get lost in the what-ifs you lose so much time making sure this idea is perfect. Itxe2x80x99s important to just have a bias for action. Just build it is a huge life-changing ideology.Ixe2x80x99m in a couple of Discord channels where almost every morning, someone alerts everyone and just goes xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s time to build.xe2x80x9d And it gives me so much hype for the day. Itxe2x80x99s totally time to build.There's so much room for no code. No-code for everything. I wish I could rename it. I think low-code is definitely the move where you can change the frontend and data handling. We're not talking about something like Webflow, which is focused on design, but more about data handling where you have the same logical flow as code, but made visual. Thatxe2x80x99s going to have huge ramifications. The ability for someone to have an idea and build it really quickly is crazy.10 years ago, there was a very small amount of people who could build things on the internet. And the builders had all the power because they were the roadblock between an idea and its existence. In Web 1.0 and 2.0, the builders were the only ones who were able to build their ideas, so products reflected an engineerxe2x80x99s ideologies. With buildings, an architect needs to find builders to build their building. But with no-code, the architect is basically 3D-printing that building and not needing to hire builders.You will have a big shift from builders to architects 5 years from now, where itxe2x80x99s going to be way more valuable on the internet to be a creative than to be a builder.When youxe2x80x99re able to build things a lot quicker, more people will have a say in what gets built. I think we're already seeing that this year. Back in my old job, I built all our internal automation systems on Bubble. We had an internal set of software for all our processes. So when we acquired a new company, we just plugged them into our software suite and they were ready to work with all our systems out of the box. Not only that, but I also could teach everyone in every department how to add new features to our software.That way, there was no bottleneck in making the software better because, for example, the people in customer support who are using the software for customer support could also go and build things onto the software suite.There's so much room there where the person with the problem has the power to solve it for themselves. Our original plan was to build tunnelers, sell them to governments, and use that money to build the first Pipedream.We discovered that we can make it happen with technology that already exists. No need to build our own tunnelers. So the first version of Pipedream will be built with existing technology and utilize the district portal system. And then in the future, there will be one connected to every home. We call that the Loop.I love this idea of hyperlogistics and we think it's the inevitable place that logistics is going to go.I'm going to keep building until this technology exists. If someone beats us to it, we'll open one of the first businesses on top of it. That's going to create a whole new opportunity for businesses. I'm in this industry for the rest of my life.Join the Pipedream teamThanks for reading! You can follow Garrett on Twitter @thegarrettscott if you havenxe2x80x99t already.

Hexe2x80x99s also been an investor at Rocana Ventures and 208 Seed Ventures and was previously an operator at two AI startups. Apply to be an LP in Countdown CapitalIxe2x80x99m a product manager turned investor and, in the same vein, somebody really passionate about partnering up with founders and wanting to help them build leveraging my own experiences. My identity as an investor is grounded in my 10 angel investments to date in deep tech startups.Above all, Ixe2x80x99m really focused on helping deep tech founders be more conscious of their decision-making as they build their companies. My personal view is that the lean startup methodology shouldnxe2x80x99t apply to deep tech startupsxe2x80x94founders should take their time to understand the impact of their product on the world and embed ethics in their decision-making and product development processes. I want founders to pursue conscious development. Our new firm is called Countdown Capital, and wexe2x80x99re raising our first fundxe2x80x94a $5 million pre-seed and seed-stage fund. At the heart of the fund is an in-house ethics platform wexe2x80x99ve been building to accompany our capital. We're investing and providing support for frontier tech startups that are committed to deep philosophical and ethical thinking on top of breakthrough engineering. Wexe2x80x99re named Countdown Capital because we believe wexe2x80x99re counting down to a major inflection point in modern history. On one hand, our society is at the cusp of a new industrial age, with numerous technologies set to reshape the nature of industrials this decade. On the other hand, these technologies are also a ticking time bomb. Without the right ethical processes in place, building emerging technology products will only compound systemic problems and ultimately fail to maximize positive impact.Our thesis is thoughtful pioneers deliver returns. The more thoughtful the deep tech founding team, the more likely their companies will generate outsized returns.We believe when building a product with ethics in mind, deep tech founders will understand their market better, be more successful at working with regulators, and have an outsized impact on our world by creating value for stakeholders that are not just direct customers.If you're not thinking about ethics early on as a deep tech founder, you will almost certainly face more scrutiny later on and will face greater adoption challenges compared to startups that have thought and are thinking about ethics at an early stage.Apply to be an LP in Countdown Some things we'd like to invest in are:Extended Reality (AR/VR)AI, as it relates to physical products (not software-enabled AI)Future of manufacturing (additive manufacturing, robotics)Future-focused mobility (in-space and on-earth)Autonomous vehiclesUAVs and eVTOL aircraftWe recently closed our first Countdown investment in Dash Shipping (co-invested with 8VC and Tusk Ventures), which is a guidance, navigation, and control powered autonomous package release company. Theyxe2x80x99re building tail kits capable of landing packages within a certain range to automate middle-mile supply chain processes without having to land a plane. Essentially, you can throw a package out of a plane and get it to land wherever you need it to go. Pitch Countdown Capital2020 has been validation that the birth of a new Industrial Revolution is imminent. In the past year, wexe2x80x99ve seen:The rise of remote work, which has created massive growth and new opportunities in tech Computing advances that have enabled machine learning to reach new heights (e.g., GPT-3).The COVID-19 pandemic, which has reminded many entrepreneurs of the prevalence and importance of going after big problems.Today, we're firmly in the era of software. but in some sense, I see this upcoming decade marked by the convergence of our digital and physical worlds. The deep tech ecosystem will try to bring software business models into hardware, and software-focused teams will bring hardware into the mix. If youxe2x80x99re looking for evidence of this, just take a look at the business models of new startups in the additive manufacturing space as well as the application of machine learning as it relates to autonomous vehicles and aircraft. At Countdown, we see convergence as the defining characteristic of the new industrial revolution and want to invest in products that are realizing this future of convergence. This new industrial revolution will take place as software becomes increasingly saturated and our society continues to age. For example, there are over half a million software companies in existence today. Annual sales growth for public software companies over the last five to six years has been declining on an aggregate basis. That trend will likely continue along with the commoditization of software. Moreover, the median age of the average American continues to increase. It has jumped from 28 years old in 1970 to 38 years old today. As our society ages, we will have a serious need to maintain productivity growth with the help of emerging technologies and to jumpstart innovation in industrial sectors.Many deep tech investors are very optimistic about the future. Ixe2x80x99m more realisticxe2x80x94progress is hard, progress is slow, and the future is not always as rosy as it seems. Labor displacement is happening and will continue to happen. Americans by and large believe that we need to have machines more carefully managed. In general, wexe2x80x99re also finding that regulatory scrutiny, as it relates to data and machine ethics, is increasing.As important as it is to take big swings, itxe2x80x99s equally important to know who youxe2x80x99re hitting with those swings. The reason why ethics is important at an early stage is that there are many complicated issues and dilemmas that are non-technical and deeply woven into the engineering process of many deep tech products. If founding teams deal with those dilemmas poorly, it can hurt their prospects of creating long-term value for their customers and stakeholders while also bringing unwanted regulatory attention. Ethical issues that are poorly managed can lead startups to build products that are suboptimal long-term solutions for the underlying problems themselves. I'll give you a very tangible example of an ethical issue many people like to talk about: algorithmic bias. Itxe2x80x99s the idea of having bias in a dataset and/or machine learning output that systematically and disproportionately misclassifies people or objects and leads to unjust outcomes. Often, it impacts people of color and/or the less privileged. Thus, it's extremely important to try to understand what biases exist in your inputs and outputs. As the general public begins to understand the prevalence of algorithmic bias, customers will begin to make assumptions and judgments about any unjustified biases that end-products are prone to and perpetuate. At Countdown, managing algorithmic bias starts with education. We want to drive home the point to founders that they need to audit their inputs and outputs and understand the importance of responsibly sourced data. We also want to help them create cadenced reports that monitor growth in bias. Our founders need to understand what types of people or objects are going to be misclassified at a higher rate versus others. We are also planning to build toolkits for founders so they can audit on a regular basis and understand these issues in real-time without our help. Our support goes way beyond just algorithmic bias. I recently led a syndicate investment in an aerospace startup, and we just had a meeting with the founding team to discuss how they see their climate impact and what steps to take to identify the best suppliers and solutions on the engineering side to ensure that the product is carbon neutral despite being a hypersonic jet. Again, the idea is moving away from a zero-sum mentality and understanding that ethics and engineering progress can co-exist. We believe teams can embed ethics early on when designing and building their product so that theyxe2x80x99re not trying to correct ethical debt later on in their companyxe2x80x99s life. Another popular area of interest we help founders with is helping them diversify their workforce. One of the most important things people don't usually talk about with respect to deep tech startups is how male-dominated their workforce is. We've been having good conversations with a team I made an angel investment in along these lines and are trying to understand what processes are optimal to ensure that more women are brought into their fold. The third issue we're addressing with numerous aerospace startups is safety. What processes need to be in place to ensure the people working on the productxe2x80x94as well as the people who will be operating the product at some pointxe2x80x94are going to be in the safest conditions possible? Managing safety and safety-related issues will be important as New Space grows. The cornerstone of our ethics platform is an ethics education and advisory board, which we call our Ethics Steering Committee. We do monthly meetings with our portfolio founders to navigate some of the deepest product-related ethical dilemmas and challenges they encounter. Headlining the Committee today areDr. Sarah Sewall, former under Secretary of State in the Obama AdministrationDr. S. Matthew Liao, distinguished professor and Chair of Bioethics at New York UniversityDr. Marianna Ganapini, top AI Ethics researcher at the Montreal AI Ethics InstituteWexe2x80x99ve taken a lot of time to find the right people, do pilot meetings, and figure out what does and doesnxe2x80x99t make sense logistically. Wexe2x80x99re always learning about what to do better. This is a very strong offering that I've not seen other firms offer for their founders, and wexe2x80x99re excited to bring some of the brightest minds together in the same room with founders to help them understand and educate them on the importance of ethics in a practical, technical setting. The rest of our platform is focused on partnering with founders on defined ethics & philosophy support initiatives. We're going to be offering different components of ethics-related value-add to our portfolio companies, in addition to our Steering Committee meetings. Machine ethics research. Helping founders operationalize solutions to machine-related ethical dilemmas (like trolley problems) and best practices around data governance.Ethical risk assessments. Providing ethical risk reports for founders through annual reviews of business practices and social impact profile.Diversity and inclusion. Aiding founders in implementing equitable hiring practices and building an inclusive culture.Second-order stakeholder engagement. Leveraging the Committeexe2x80x99s network to foster relationships between founders and external stakeholders.Codified statements of purpose. Challenging founders to codify their mission, values, and principles to build purpose-driven cultures.To drive these support initiatives, wexe2x80x99ve hired two Philosophy Associates, both Oxford-educated philosophers (one Ph.D. and one MPhil). The reason we've done this is to make a very strong commitment to our mission and build a new type of VC firm that not only is providing investment support, but also philosophical and ethical support. While our investment associate and I will undoubtedly be working on typical VC-portfolio company support (making intros to other funds, helping them with marketing, strategic planning, etc.), we're also going to be putting talented people to work helping founders with the ethical side of things as well.Wexe2x80x99re building an entirely new platform of value-add focused on machine and corporate ethics. When building a product, there are different stakeholders you can interview to get a sense of your product-market fit. When we work with startups to build ethics, our first question to founders is alwaysxe2x80x94who have you interviewed to get a sense of the pain point thatxe2x80x99s out there? What wexe2x80x99ve found is that most founders are never asking folks affected by their products from a second-order degree of impact when they think of their product or underlying technology. Theyxe2x80x99re only asking questions and seeking answers from who's paying for their products. That's a big problem. If you want to build a world-class product that creates good in the world, you need to seek out a deeper level of feedback that doesnxe2x80x99t just consist of customer interviews. We want to broaden the horizon for deep tech founders and put manpower in place that will help founders talk to these second-order stakeholders they would usually never talk to. In fact, thatxe2x80x99s precisely what wexe2x80x99re doing with a portfolio company of mine called Forsight. With our help, the Forsight team is in the process of interviewing workers on construction sitesxe2x80x94not just their supervisorsxe2x80x94to understand how they feel about having artificial intelligence on the ground. We're also having open conversations with founders and we're putting togetherxe2x80x94with their supportxe2x80x94statements of purpose and operating principles. For example, one of our portfolio companies is interested in understanding the ethics of selling to foreign governments. If you don't have certain values in place or certain operating principles, you will never say no when such an opportunity comes knocking. So we are working with founders to put together some of those guidelines as well, which goes hand in hand with diversity and inclusion. The combination of different components all contributes to this platform of ethics as a service.My pivot away from a product into investing came from my desire not to want to work for a single team. I want to support the whole market of teams that are working on important problems to maximize my impact. Investing is, in my opinion, a way of supporting bigger solutions to big problems and not putting all your eggs in one basket. At Rocana Ventures, Ixe2x80x99ve had the privilege of seeing how traditional VC firms operate everything ranging from sourcing to due diligence to deal negotiation. My experience at Rocana has shown me how to manage the entire lifecycle of an investment from start to finish. I would say there's no playbook to being an early-stage investor. To me, the key to being a great investor lies in self-understandingxe2x80x94if you understand what your own blind spots are as a person and have a deep conviction in your vision for the world, you are already way ahead of the curve. A lot of investors I know prefer to invest as generalists or end up investing in increasingly broad sectors (like enterprise software). Personally, I've always been interested in deep tech and compelled by the hard sciences. It's been embedded in my life since I was a kid. At a tender age, I wanted to be an astrophysicist and fantasized about space.In general, I urge everyone reading this to angel invest if they can. It has taught me so much about myself. Ixe2x80x99ve failed to understand a couple of concepts along the way, so itxe2x80x99s been a great impetus to keep learning, do more research, and finally arrive at a clear understanding of an investment opportunity. Angel investing has been great because it shows you where your knowledge is lacking and how you can do better as an investor.I have a really deep relationship with philosophy, and that has become core to my identity over the years. I studied philosophy along with business in college, which inspired me at first to pursue a Ph.D. in Philosophy. I soon discovered Ludwig Wittgenstein, who sought to bring philosophy out of structured academic settings. Likewise, I soon realized that philosophy was meant to be practiced and applied in everyday lifexe2x80x94the art of critical and logical thinking neednxe2x80x99t take place in an academic setting. After undergrad, I was all set to go to Nepal, join a monastery, and spend my days thinking about life and big questions without needing to be confined by the politics of academia.I was always particularly interested in philosophy of mind, which is an area of philosophy that examines artificial intelligence, the nature of consciousness, the verifiability of emotional and physical experiences, and more. Before leaving for Nepal, I applied for a Chief of Staff position at an AI startup on a whim and got the job. At the time, I was interested in seeing what artificial intelligence looks like when it's applied in a practical setting, so I put my monk plans on hold. Today, Ixe2x80x99m a long way from my first post-college summer. Yet the memory of how I wanted to be a monk and how much I loved studying and reading philosophy on a daily basis has not faded away. My continued passion for philosophy has shown me how disconnected ethics is from the business world and how disconnected academia is from what's happening in the venture world. The more I started investing in companies, the more I realized that there's a whole body of knowledge out there thatxe2x80x99s non-technical in nature, and founders arenxe2x80x99t getting access to it. Bringing founders access to that body of knowledge and education that is philosophical in nature is what drives a lot of what we do at Countdown. Philosophy is a way of life. It's a way of questioning, a way of assessing situations, and a way of understanding and grounding yourselfxe2x80x94both in the context of the world you live in and in the context of what you personally hold dear on this earth. And if you don't bring that way of thinking into other areas of life (like business), you're not practicing philosophy. First, I think we're going to see a bigger and deeper space ecosystem compared to what we have now. More launch startups, manufacturing in space, modular services for satellites - I expect to see all of this happening in full force. I'm also really hoping to see a fully reusable spacecraft at some point. I'm not sure if that's going to be achievable in ten to twenty years given some of the challenges on the physics side, but it's something I can dream of.I also think you'll see supersonic jets in the air by 2030. You're also going to see autonomous shipment and delivery (potentially with the last mile), through drones and other types of products - more than what we've seen in the last decade. Personally, I'm not sold on the staying power of virtual reality in industrial sectors, but I am very, very certain that augmented reality is here to stay. Itxe2x80x99s going to take something really special on the hardware side for a deep tech startup to enable something bigger for VR than entertainment or mental health use cases. I definitely think you're going to see a SpaceX Mafia this decade. In 10-20 years, anyone currently working at SpaceX is going to be working on something really cool at some point. I hope we're also going to see more younger people than ever before wanting to build hard tech products. We're already seeing an uptick in interested younger folks within certain circles, but it's only going to increase as software becomes more saturated. For deep tech products, I expect to see more crowdfunding and more early public related private financing than we have today. For companies like Atom Limbs, using platforms like Republic or Wefunder will become increasingly popular as an alternative to pre-seed financing.There will be more capital available to deep tech startups in 10-20 years, but it will likely be concentrated in a small set of companies. A few mega deep tech companies, like SpaceX, will grow tremendously and take up the lion's share of capital. The future of venture capital firms is productizing and owning value-add components for founders. It will be hard to compete for deals otherwise. You wonxe2x80x99t see VC firms get away with providing ad hoc support without a real focus or definition. The only firms that will be immune to this are the bigger generalist shops that are renowned and truly provide best-in-class support regardless of need: a16z, Sequoia, Canaan, etc. Early examples of productized support include Tusk Ventures, which owns regulatory support for startups, and Form Capital, offering design expertise and support alongside capital for their portfolio companies. You could write a whole book on how to get more people to start hard tech companies. I think it comes down to education and putting the right incentives in place for students to learn physics and mechanical engineering alongside computer science. It also goes hand-in-hand with incentivizing more young people to pursue entrepreneurship and to not be afraid to take risks. A big problem is that our government today doesn't seem to value some of the hard tech advances and investments we used to value and build in the 1960s and xe2x80x9870s. We could see how that changes as NASA continues to refocus on space activities, among other developments. Our top priority is always to generate outsized returns for our investorsxe2x80x94we are capital allocators first.On a more intimate level, at the end of the day, we want a majority of our founders to tell us five to ten years from now, xe2x80x9cHey, you actually made a difference as we built our company.xe2x80x9d That's it. And it's a very simple thing to say, but it would mean that we did something more than just put money where our mouth is. It's amazing how many founders I speak to who say that their investors on the cap table don't do or havenxe2x80x99t done anything meaningful for them in the long-term. Founder happiness and fund success are the two things we really value at the end of the day. Obviously, fund success will be valued more often than not in the form of cash-on-cash returns. But all of our team members are driven by the idea that we can help talented human beings realize a more humane future. We want our talented portfolio companies to be proud of having us on their side.From an operational standpoint, in the long run, we want to be able to expand the ethics platform wexe2x80x99re building. I have a plethora of ideas about how to scale and evolve the community we have today into a robust network and how we are going to offer even deeper machine ethics research and support. But the most important thing here is and has always been making sure that everything we do is actually going to actually help founders on their mission to change the world for the better.If youxe2x80x99re interested in becoming an LP in Countdown Capital, or if you know someone who might be, click the link below to apply!Become an LP in CountdownIf youxe2x80x99re a deep tech founder and are interested in working with Countdown, feel free to pitch Countdown below:Pitch a company to CountdownThanks for reading!

Hexe2x80x99s also done work as part of the Hyperloop UC team. Wexe2x80x99ll dive into his learning process, thoughts on starting a hard tech company, and how Vuecason is building the future of metal 3D printing. At Vuecason, wexe2x80x99re building a 3D printer that can print metal through a nozzle, like plastic. We heat and place the metal in one step, which allows us to print large high-performance parts quickly and cheaply. The one question wexe2x80x99re trying to answer is: how do we make creating physical things more like software? That's the goal. What we want to do eventually is build a high-level manufacturing solution for everyone. Vuecason is a deliberate misspelling of Vaucanson (Jacques de Vaucanson), who invented the metal lathe. However, hexe2x80x99s most known for building something called the digesting duck, which is a robot duck that could seemingly eat food, digest it, and poop it out. Naming the company Vuecason and making the logo a duck is a way to pay tribute to his work with the metal lathe. Without the lathe, the steam engine wouldnxe2x80x99t exist and the industrial revolution wouldnxe2x80x99t have occurred.Letxe2x80x99s compare our product to a binder jet printer, like the one Desktop Metal builds. When you have when you deal with powderxe2x80x94particularly binder jetxe2x80x94it's about how well you can fuse that powder together (which creates a strong part) and how you do it in an even/uniform manner. It takes a ton of simulation to predict shrinkage and thermal stress, so at the moment itxe2x80x99s very difficult to print parts larger than a grapefruit.If you go the binder jet route with powder, it becomes challenging to achieve the strength and uniformity needed for high-performance parts. I'm sure they'll improve on it over time, but if your customers are in aerospace or tool manufacturing, quite a few of them are gonna care about high-strength, high-performance parts. Another dominant metal printing technology is direct metal laser sintering (DMLS). A laser fuses layers of metal together in a bed of metal powder. However, these machines are very expensive and require a lot of existing infrastructure to operate. You actually need a cleanroom suit and respirator when cleaning up the finished parts.DMLS can produce stronger high-quality parts, but the printers require a high upfront capital investment and high operating cost. Theyxe2x80x99re also too slow to scale for most low volume manufacturing applications.The Vuecason printer aims to provide high strength, larger part volumes, and shorter lead times per part (if produced sequentially) than binder jet while making sure that the machine is cheaper to operate than both binder jet and DMLS. I think metal will be important, at least for the near term future. Who knows what new materials will exist in 100 years? I donxe2x80x99txe2x80x94or at least I donxe2x80x99t pretend to knowxe2x80x94if metal will be a popular material. There are some really cool exotic materials that still use metals. I donxe2x80x99t think metal is going anywhere, but wexe2x80x99ll probably see some more things that will look like new metal alloys, or (if we manage to do it cheaply) metal matrix composites.Carbon fiber is becoming really huge. But even though the cost of carbon fiber is dropping significantly year over year, itxe2x80x99s still very far away from ending up in most things. Itxe2x80x99s acceptable for aerospace, though. But there are also lots of difficulties in designing and manufacturing carbon fiber parts as well. If you want to add more design complexity and slow down iteration, then carbon fiber is the way to go. If you want to speed things up and not think much about manufacturing, then metal printing will let you do that in the future. It wonxe2x80x99t let you do that today, but wexe2x80x99re working on it.Ixe2x80x99m not a huge fan of lean startup, because if you do it with hard tech, youxe2x80x99re gonna burn through money really quickly.The Lean Startup doesnxe2x80x99t really work for hard tech. I think a better approach is going the Zero to One route, where each idea is predicated on a secret very few people agree with you on. Either that or just being really deliberate about what your plan is and really thinking about what your company is going to do. Having that mission and internalizing it is important. You donxe2x80x99t need to follow it exactly, but itxe2x80x99s still useful to think through the details. That way, youxe2x80x99re forced to articulate your own feelings at the very least. At the same time, you need to move very fast and be ready to pivot and iterate at any time. So there are two important questions you need to ask yourselfxe2x80x94what should my plan be, and then how do I set my company up to be as flexible as possible around that plan? I follow the Pioneer weekly goal setup where you do a progress update every week about what youxe2x80x99ve done and plan on doing next week. Once I get to the point where the focus is more on iteration and testing, then a lot of it will be more quantifiable, like taking a 3D scan of whatxe2x80x99s being printed and comparing the dimensional accuracy to the original part designed on a computer.In the very early stages, you donxe2x80x99t need to use anything fancy like a Gantt chart. But personally, I definitely need to start using those soon. Vuecason has mostly been a side project up until now, Ixe2x80x99m just getting more serious about it. If you want to get super tactical, you can also use things like Long Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) tools to project things like burn rate.Working on a side project full time is a huge jump. When youxe2x80x99re not working on something full time, itxe2x80x99s not that you canxe2x80x99t make progress, but you canxe2x80x99t completely devote your mind to what youxe2x80x99re working on. And you really want to be thinking about your idea 24/7, in my opinion. I kind of do that already, but it collides with everything else. And now I can focus 100%. Thatxe2x80x99s extremely helpful.Working on Vuecason is really fun. I enjoy it a lot. I think when you make something you can physically hold or see in real life, thatxe2x80x99s really cool. And then when you can program it to move around and do things, thatxe2x80x99s even cooler. Itxe2x80x99s incredibly euphoric. I canxe2x80x99t even describe it, but itxe2x80x99s definitely a good feeling.I think you also need to have both strong internal and external motivation. For example, everyone at SpaceX works long hours because they want to go to Mars. That sense of purpose also compels people to work harder at an individual level. If you want your project to be convincing enough to make everyone want to help you, itxe2x80x99s important to give people something bigger that keeps them obsessed.Most of the time, the things I build donxe2x80x99t work on the first try. If you want to think of risk from a business perspective, what youxe2x80x99ll find with a lot of hard tech companies is that you donxe2x80x99t have much market risk. If your technology works, you will usually have a market thatxe2x80x99s ready for it. So almost all of the risk is technical risk. And I personally think that technical risk is generally easier to navigate than market risk. With market risk, there are so many unknowns. And with technical risk, youxe2x80x99re governed by the laws of physics, thermodynamics, power, and materials science. If your technology violates that, you know itxe2x80x99s time to work on something else. So in most cases, you kind of already know if your technology is possible or not, and then itxe2x80x99s just a matter of figuring out the few things you need to get there.One important part of minimizing risk is building the right team. Generally, almost everyone on your team needs to be technical and have complementary skill sets. For example, if youxe2x80x99re building a robotics company and one founder is good at computer engineering, it might be a good idea to have another cofounder that knows mechanical engineering. Some people, like Blake Scholl of Boom, are non-technical but can still put together a team. Elon had a software background but managed to teach himself enough to hire smart people. Sometimes, you donxe2x80x99t even need to build anything first, and it can be enough to run simulations. In a traditional software product, you have high market risk but the technical risk is much lower because the barriers to entry are lower. More people also want to go the Elon route and start a software company to eventually fund something bigger, but I think itxe2x80x99s better to just work on problems you already care about.I think it's always good to talk to customers. Generally, you might not want to try to close sales or secure LOIs right away, but it depends on multiple factors. Itxe2x80x99s mostly a question of progress youxe2x80x99ve made at that point. For me, as soon as I have a printhead that works and Ixe2x80x99m confident it can do 2D layers, then I can go after LOIs. That way, I have the confidence to back up what Ixe2x80x99m pitching so it doesnxe2x80x99t feel like Ixe2x80x99m wasting the customerxe2x80x99s timexe2x80x94I can actually deliver on what Ixe2x80x99m trying to sell. Talking to customers is super important. You should at least know what theyxe2x80x99re upset about. You donxe2x80x99t need to listen to them all the time, but you should at least be aware of what theyxe2x80x99re thinking. What some of the best companiesxe2x80x94the really, really, cool onesxe2x80x94will do is figure out what the customer wants, or what the customer says they want. But then they also know what the customer actually wants but canxe2x80x99t articulate yet. A lot of times, those two things are very different.A big reason why not as many people are starting hard tech companies is a marketing/PR issue. Itxe2x80x99s a perception issue, for sure. People think about deep tech and automatically assume itxe2x80x99s going to be extremely difficult.   But a lot of the problem is also cultural. If you go to school, youxe2x80x99re encouraged to specialize in one area. Maybe itxe2x80x99s engineering, or perhaps itxe2x80x99s the humanities. For the average person, specialization is generally okay, but it doesnxe2x80x99t give people the right skill set for running a company.If I stuck with the computer engineering route, I would have probably gotten a Masterxe2x80x99s in digital signal processing, which is really cool. And it can be helpful. Ixe2x80x99d have an excellent career. But having a Masterxe2x80x99s in signal processing doesnxe2x80x99t help me in any way if Ixe2x80x99m starting a 3D printing company.If you can combine your interests from multiple fields, especially in tech, thatxe2x80x99s best. If you know the basics of a wide range of topicsxe2x80x94electrical engineering, computer engineer, software developmentxe2x80x94and also understand the basics of mechanical engineering, youxe2x80x99re in a really good position to discover lots of opportunities you wouldnxe2x80x99t have realized were there before. Youxe2x80x99re able to see where things fall short in each field.Investment-wise, firms like Lux Capital, Founders Fund, and 1517 Fund are great. Recently, a lot of deep tech investors I see are usually running smaller seed or pre-seed funds. This makes it much easier to get started with fundraising. Deep tech doesnxe2x80x99t go very well with the standard VC model, where they expect you to exit within 5 years. Five years is literally the duration of the fund. If youxe2x80x99re looking for funding, you need investors that are aligned with what youxe2x80x99re building.The software industry is obsessed with dev tools. You see dev tools startups all the time. And itxe2x80x99s awesome because productivity for developers is going up every year. There are always new products to try out as well as all the new problems that come with it. If you look at the mechanical engineering world, thatxe2x80x99s not quite the case. You have CAD programs that let you model whatever youxe2x80x99re designing with a computer, but we donxe2x80x99t have real dev tools for hardware yet. The ones that do exist usually stay proprietary or internal to the company theyxe2x80x99re used at. Theyxe2x80x99re usually not spun out into separate companies or sold as a separate product. And thatxe2x80x99s partially because theyxe2x80x99re hyper-specialized, but also because that kind of obsession with making engineers more productive isnxe2x80x99t there.If you have a bit of a software background and youxe2x80x99re aware that dev tools are a real market, why donxe2x80x99t they exist in the mechanical engineering world? Thatxe2x80x99s when you realize that therexe2x80x99s a huge opportunity to bring some of the software world into the mechanical world.Start with what you currently know, then go deep when you encounter problems. Most people would say to start with the fundamentals, but I disagree. This is one area where Ixe2x80x99m the exact opposite. Fundamentals matter, but most people donxe2x80x99t understand them thoroughly without hindsight. For some people, learning the fundamentals upfront works really well, and theyxe2x80x99re able to determine when to use which thing. For me, I need to just work on it. Itxe2x80x99s also a lot more fun for me that way. Obviously, you should know the bare minimum of the fundamentals first. I wouldnxe2x80x99t say to learn calculus, but everything up to that youxe2x80x99ll have to know to at least get started. And then itxe2x80x99s really a process of learning how to learn.If you can learn quickly, you donxe2x80x99t need to rely on the fundamentals. Go ahead and try making something that fails. Try to understand why it fails. If you donxe2x80x99t understand why it failed, thatxe2x80x99s a great place to start digging deeper and look for the root cause and figure out what actually went wrong. Over time, you will learn the fundamentals just by doing work, and often better because youxe2x80x99ll know the context to use each tool. In a physics textbook, you can learn all the laws and equations, but if you notice, most of the problems for each chapter are just small variants of three or four different problem archetypes. In the real world, many problems are too complex to model compared to the problem archetypes that youxe2x80x99re taught in textbooks. You have to go deeper to get a better understanding. My recommendation would be to find a way (like an online tutorial) to build what you want to build. After that, figure out ways to improve it. Letxe2x80x99s say you want to build a drone, and you didnxe2x80x99t learn any of the theory behind how drones work. You didnxe2x80x99t do any calculations, and you didnxe2x80x99t sit through a university course on physics. Go ahead and build it. Build the drone. And then try to get it to take off and fly. Most likely, it wonxe2x80x99t work. The next step is to start asking yourself a ton of questions.Why isnxe2x80x99t the drone taking off?Itxe2x80x99s going at full throttle, the propeller is spinning, but therexe2x80x99s no lift. Why is that?Are the motors providing enough thrust?Is the drone too heavy?And finally, if you keep Googling random stuff, youxe2x80x99ll eventually come across the idea of thrust-to-weight ratio. And you start to ask yourself: what is the minimum thrust-to-weight ratio needed to let my drone take off?Thatxe2x80x99s when you learn the basic physics equations. Youxe2x80x99ll realize, xe2x80x9cOh, I have to make sure the force due to thrust has to exceed the force due to gravity to make the drone go up.xe2x80x9dItxe2x80x99s not a hard calculation, but you still need to learn how to calculate that number. Youxe2x80x99d end up repeating this process several times for various things, but after lots of mistakes, youxe2x80x99ll have a functioning drone.  On the other hand, if you try to learn all the fundamentals, like physics and controls first, you can spend 40 hours reading textbooks and still have no clue what youxe2x80x99re doing. A lot of times, itxe2x80x99s really important to know when to use something, rather than just how to do it. Using calculus as an example, you donxe2x80x99t need to know how to actually integrate. You just need to know when to use it, then you can throw it in the calculator. You shouldnxe2x80x99t be doing that by hand anyway. You need to know when to use which tool, and the best way to learn that is by applying it in context.Having a lab or workshop is not as important as you might think. You could even start a hard tech company from your phone.Itxe2x80x99s highly situational, but for engineering, a lot of the equipment you need can be easily found at online suppliers like McMaster-Carr, or you can order customized parts (like 3D-printed or machined parts) from manufacturers and get them delivered to you.I think that often, people tend to rationalize themselves out of starting a hardware project because they immediately think about the parts they need to buy to build it. I think you can go far with just designing a project on a computer with CAD software, then running a simulation to evaluate the chances of it working. No lab or physical parts needed on day one.  Now, if youxe2x80x99re doing something like biotech or something research-heavy that must be peer-reviewed, you might actually need a lab.Hypocritically, the way I learn things looks more like the Lean Startup approach, rather than trying to figure out a deliberate plan. Itxe2x80x99s odd to think about, but when it comes to learning things, there are so many things you canxe2x80x99t know from the beginning anyway. Your fundamentals arenxe2x80x99t really fundamentals. Theyxe2x80x99re just a few things you thought were important. Sometimes (a lot of times) they actually are important, but with something like metal printing, I did not know everything from day one. I just made a lot of assumptions. And then I spent lots of time trying to figure out if my assumptions were actually correct. I'm all in on metal printing. If this printing stuff works out and then 20 years later I want to find something else to do, I either want to get involved in semiconductor fabrication, or nuclear fission. I donxe2x80x99t know anything about either of those industries, but those are good things to focus on. Metal printing can be used for some parts of nuclear fission reactors. Nuclear reactors are super expensive to build. And as a result of that, you have things like aging reactors, where if you want to replace a part, the supply chain doesnxe2x80x99t exist anymore because the reactor was built 70 years ago.So the companies that built those parts for you are out of business or typically donxe2x80x99t make that part anymore. And so if you metal print those parts, you can actually cut down on the cost of maintaining existing nuclear reactors. Assuming it meets all the qualifications and certifications, and itxe2x80x99s safe.The general idea is to make it easier to prototype things quickly. When investors think about manufacturing, they only care about speed. But if you talk to customers, most of the time they donxe2x80x99t even know what they want to build.The plan is to focus entirely on aerospace and tool manufacturers, and what I mean by tool manufacturing or machine tools is the people who design the factory that makes all your products. These industries have the highest leverage for progress in the world of atoms. Itxe2x80x99s important that we make it easier to iterate on rockets, aircraft, and the manufacturing lines that make millions of parts a year.Titanium is the priority, in terms of some of the first materials we want to do. Another alloy I want to do is and tool steel and Inconel. The priority is getting those done. We have to start with those because itxe2x80x99s incredibly difficult to create a new market from scratch. Instead of making things even harder on ourselves, we can start with something where the demand already exists, then push the frontier and expand it outwards.The Vuecason printer should be able to print any conductive metal in the future. It will take far less R&D to adopt new metals compared to metal printing companies that use proprietary metals. If we were to jump into manufacturing exotic materials where there might not be a clear market for them, we also end up taking on lots of market risk, which is what wexe2x80x99re trying to avoid in the first place with a hard tech company.I donxe2x80x99t think printing will change everything, or that you can print every single part. Therexe2x80x99s always going to be fundamental limits that youxe2x80x99ll reach eventually with printing. Maybe in the long term, we can get there, but not in the next 10 years. One way to improve production at high volume is to make a 3D printer, and then build the right software on top of it to help automate the design process for your machine tooling.If you have a product you need to manufacture, we can build a software solution thatxe2x80x99s able to figure out which 3D-printed tools you need to manufacture something at X volume per year. One example is injection molds. You can 3D-print an injection mold and fill it with plastic. And when you do that with 3D printers, there are quite a few advantages you gain from that.Hopefully, in the long run, metal 3D printing will at least touch every manufacturing process, but I donxe2x80x99t think it will replace all of them.For me personally, Ixe2x80x99m trying to figure out how to declare war on stagnation, and eventually end it. I want to get rid of every technological reason for stagnation. There are some regulatory reasons I canxe2x80x99t get around, but my goal is to figure out what technology can be built to end stagnation or at the very least eviscerate all perceived stagnation.If we make making things stupid easy, wexe2x80x99ll have no choice but to make progress as a society. You wonxe2x80x99t be able to say that hard tech is hard anymore. Itxe2x80x99ll just be regular tech where you can drag your design around on your screen and print it.Wexe2x80x99re very far from it, but the ideal scenario would look like Tony Stark telling Jarvis to change the color of the suit to red or come up with a new alloy, and Jarvis can derive the new part geometry and develop a new alloy on the spot, then manufacture it within five hours. Thatxe2x80x99s amazing. Thatxe2x80x99s the vision Ixe2x80x99d like to see for prototyping.At the moment, I donxe2x80x99t actually think metal printing is that usefulxe2x80x94even for prototyping. If you prototype a part that needs to be traditionally manufactured on a metal printer, all the physical properties of the part will be different. So the design needs to be changed in order to scale to production.The plan is to build a machine that can do prototyping, in terms of creating long-term value. And after that, the production version of that machine should use the same type of nozzle and the same type of printing technology, so that when you scale your prototype to production, you wonxe2x80x99t need to change anything. The value of prototyping will be much much higher and we can iterate in production much much quicker.

Foundationxe2x80x99s initial vertical was space manufacturing, and youxe2x80x99ll see some of that reflected in our conversation. Justin takes us through his thoughts on bringing Moorexe2x80x99s law to the physical world through self-replication, startup advice for working on hard companies, why itxe2x80x99s important to spend lots of time learning and internalizing the fundamental principles of a field.I describe myself as someone who likes doing things that do not have a playbook. If a task or activity doesnxe2x80x99t have a playbook, that means there arenxe2x80x99t any readily available resources online, like books, that tell you how to do it.Let's give some examples of things that have a playbook. Basically, you can do some sort of pattern matching under action.Today, becoming an AI researcher has a playbook, even if it's a difficult job. If I meet someone who tells me, xe2x80x9cI went from doing a Bachelors in Art to working at DeepMind,xe2x80x9d Ixe2x80x99d be deeply impressed. But deep down inside, I know therexe2x80x99s a playbook for that. I know itxe2x80x99s perfectly doable. Therexe2x80x99s a clear path from artist to DeepMind.Side note: Justin wrote his own playbook for teaching yourself enough AI to get to the research level.Starting a tech startup has a playbook because even if it's extremely difficult, plenty of people have done it before. There is so much information out there that explains to you how to do it.If today you wanted to get in the top 1% of the strongest people in the world, you know how to do it. It could take 10 years, but therexe2x80x99s a clear path from where you are now to the top 1% of the strongest people in the world. There is a clear training program with specific workouts.Things that don't have playbooks are activities where you can't pattern match what you should do compared to what people have already done because you canxe2x80x99t find anyone whoxe2x80x99s done the thing before.Something that has a playbook doesn't mean easy, but I'm more interested in stuff where the path has not been laid down. It can be anything from starting very hard companies to writing genre-defying fiction.Therexe2x80x99s this part of science thatxe2x80x99s kind of dead, called molecular assembly. Itxe2x80x99s the idea of being able to put molecules and ions wherever you want in space. Because if you can arrange molecules however you want, youxe2x80x99re able to do tons of things, from copying the best Wagyu beef in the world to building laptops with a billion cores in their processor.Itxe2x80x99s very trivial in its descriptionxe2x80x94we want to put molecules wherever we want. The science was really hyped up in the 1980s. Tons of people were working on it. But if you unroll history from then to now, not much has happened recently. People stopped working on this for various reasons. An example of doing something without a playbook would be if someone who took a look at molecular assembly, read all the papers, contacted the researchers that are still alive, and tried to figure out a way to bring back some of that usefulness into a product or research paper.Therexe2x80x99s no way to Google for a Medium article that tells you how to learn molecular manufacturing or start your own side project around it.When I meet people, one kind of quick filter I have to see if wexe2x80x99ll get along is whether, in their life story, theyxe2x80x99ve done things that are not just hard, but also without a playbook.The plan we announced for Foundation at the Pioneer livestream was we were going to build in space.And the reason we want to do that is because we think it's a great first market for a company whose final goal is to build self-replicating machinesxe2x80x94a machine that builds all the machines. If you can build a robot that can build more robots, you bring Moorexe2x80x99s law to the physical world.Ixe2x80x99ve spoken to so many people at NASA, ESA, JPL, and co. It might be a bit too early for factories on the moon. However, today is definitely the right time to start a space company. Surprisingly, people don't understand how fast things are moving.If you want to build a constellation company or do things in orbit, today's the best time to start such a company because SpaceX literally became the bus service of space. It's actually getting quite cheap to do stuff there. So it's a great time to start a space company, but we think Foundation might be a bit too early.I can't really talk much about our current plan. Not because we have a culture of secrecy, but mostly because it's not mature yet. The main thing that stays the same is you want to be able to build faster. And the key to that is being able to build machines that can build other machines.Take a look at the economics of the information word.The interesting thing is that computational capabilities have been multiplied by 100,000 in the last 25 years. Moore's law is at work and we get 40% cheaper compute every year. And that's completely normal to us. You are expected to wake up on Christmas Eve every year and get a computer or a phone that is 50% faster than the one you had last year.On the other side, in the physical world, you don't expect to take a flight every summer that goes 40% faster than the one you took last year. People take Moorexe2x80x99s law for granted. But in the physical world, we have nothing like that. If you work out the numbers, you realize that the physical world improves at approximately 4-5% a year, as opposed to 40% a year.And one of the most important reasons why itxe2x80x99s not going faster is because we have still not figured out a way to build faster. We have factories today. If you have upfront capital, you could build things for really cheap, but the problem is you need $100M in upfront capital.The reason why itxe2x80x99s so expensive is that we don't have machines that build machines. We have machines that build stuff (aka factories). But we don't have factories that build factories.So you want to be able to bring Moorexe2x80x99s lawxe2x80x94your 40% rate of improvement a yearxe2x80x94to the physical world. And how do you do that? If a 3D printer could print its cousin or a sibling, that would make things much faster because you have exponential laws and your distribution costs become zero. Why do you think software is so good? It's because the distribution cost is zero. If you write something that is good, you only have the upfront capital of development. And then if you consider the servers are free, you can distribute that software to the world and everybody can enjoy it.In terms of like physical products, that's not the case. You build something oncexe2x80x94great for you, but therexe2x80x99s no way you can distribute it to a hundred million people. Thatxe2x80x99s 80% of the rest of the work. The prototyping is actually the easy part. What if this changes? What if for every single physical product out there, the only cost is the upfront development costs and distribution becomes free just like software? This would change so much stuff. Your life will literally become 1000x better in a span of weeks.Anybody could come up with something that is better than what exists right now and can distribute it for free. You could have kids in their basement writing cars instead of writing appsxe2x80x94that would be so nice and full of memesxe2x80x94and you will be able to get one in your own garage.For the information world, the reason we have no distribution costs is because a lot of unknown people built the internet. They built the software that is used everywhere in terms of infrastructure. But we donxe2x80x99t care about those people. We only care about the kids that built the apps that run on top of the infrastructure.For the information world, we cheated a bit. A lot of investment has been put into developing the infrastructure itself. But I think if we can bring Moorexe2x80x99s law to the physical world, wexe2x80x99re going to see the same set of extremely cool companies and life-changing products we have seen in the information world.And the key to doing that is making manufacturing so much better that we won't even call it manufacturing anymore. We will need a new word. That's what we're working on. We think that maybe the whole space thing might not be the best way to do it, but we're definitely still working on making manufacturing 1000x better.The main path to this is building self-replicating machines. Self-replication is the equivalent of AGI for the physical world. AGI gives you complete control over information, and self-replicating machines will give you complete control over the physical world. If you look at humanity's tech tree, you have two sub-branchesxe2x80x94 information and physical. And the last node in each of those sub-trees is AGI and self-replicating machines (or molecular manufacturing, since molecular manufacturing leads to self-replication by definition).We already have self-replication. Biology does it. We don't really control it. You can do this from the bottom-up. That is, you start with cells that are already self-replicating. You think it's really hard to control them. So you spend billions of dollars and a lot of research time to figure out how to control them. Let's go biotech, right? Gingko Bioworks and similar companies get self-replication for free, but then they have to fight with a poorly written O.S. and really obfuscated code. That's what they do. So you basically have those two different approaches. Either you start from biology and you learn to control it, or you start with something you already know how to control but learn how to make it self replicating. Something that is very important is you need to find the right people. You canxe2x80x99t reach out to a random JPL guy and be like, xe2x80x9cHey, can you become part of our technical board of advisors?xe2x80x9dThe issue is if the guy actually doesn't care about the problem in the first place, he's not going to be involved. Just like pitching is much more about pitching to the right people than pitching the right way, asking for advice is much more about asking for advice from the right people than asking for advice correctly. I think that if you reach out to people that are already extremely interested in what you are working on and youxe2x80x99re also bringing some sort of fresh approach and naivete to the problem as well, this is refreshing for people.If you just reach out to people who have spent their entire life on the problem and you're like, xe2x80x9cHey, I did my homework. I know the prerequisites. We'll be able to have a good conversation together. Can we talk?xe2x80x9d There is no reason to say no, and this is the way we've approached it.You need to not make a fool of yourself in the first five minutes. After that, you can sound stupid. It's just that early on, you want to show that youxe2x80x99ve done your homework because there is nothing worse than someone reaching out to you who doesn't have any context and just thinks that they will get some free advice from you. It's the equivalent of someone reaching out on LinkedIn for a job. Even if they know you don't want to be hired right down, those bots just send a billion LinkedIn emails.You don't want to be that person. When you ask for advice, you need to be extremely well-prepared. And if youxe2x80x99re also asking the right people, it's really easy to get advice. Just like everything, there is always some networking involved. It's very sad, but even in today's world where you can literally talk with anyone anywhere, you still need to know some people and you still need to build some relationships, but it's definitely easier today than it used to be (for younger people at least).My co-founder is one of my best friends from university. I think it was in my last year of high school (or the one just before) I was on a video games forum in French because I'm from the French-speaking part of Belgium. And there's this guy who says, xe2x80x9cHey dudes, I'm studying in the South of UK and itxe2x80x99s actually fucking lit. You guys should not go study in France or Belgium because it's super lame, come study in the UK.xe2x80x9dAnd this struck me as a very great idea and it's something I hadn't considered. I thought that I had to study in Belgium like it was a law of naturexe2x80x94I thought this was something that I was forced to do.And I was like, okay, this is interesting. And then somehow a year and a half later, I ended up getting acceptance letters to all the universities I applied to in the UK. And I decided to go to the University of Edinburgh because it's super old, it looks like Hogwarts, and it's fucking amazing. So I went there and in the first year of university, I met a lot of really, really smart people.And one of them was my co-founder, Leopold. We lived together in our second year, and I traveled with him to a bunch of different places. Ixe2x80x99m a bit biased right now, but I don't think you should start a company with people you don't know very well and with whom you have not spent a significant amount of time as friends.When people do business, they tend to be different and you need to be able to go through all those awkward moments and all those moments where you should have been fighting and stuff, because then when you actually do the hard stuff, things are all right. So Leopold asked me xe2x80x9cyou know so many smart people, why me?xe2x80x9dAnd the thing I told him is that I know that if shit happens, it will be fine. We won't actually fight because we're both so stoic. And we know each other so well that we have arguments anymore, it's kind of funny. As opposed to other people who are really good friends on the superficial level, but as soon as like shit hits the fan, you don't want to trust each other anymore.So I think you really have to build up that trust and that stoicism. You need to be able to understand each other very well and go through that phase where arguments are still possible, because then when you actually do things that are very hard together, like starting a company, you won't have problems.I tried starting small products with people that didn't know well, and even if they were brilliant, as soon as we had problems, things would become very awkward. And it was hard to communicate and be upfront about things and be like, xe2x80x9cHey, you suck, you did something wrong, you should change what you've done.xe2x80x9dIt was hard for me to give that kind of feedback. With Leopold, I remember we were preparing for the Pioneer livestream and one of our objectives was that we wanted to have the best pitch deck out of every single pitch that has been given on every single Pioneer livestream.We really wanted something really good. I was the one giving the pitch. Leopold was the one who made the pitch deck and he did all those fancy 3D renders. And we were together in Spain with a bunch of friends in a hacker house. And one day I wake up and I'm like, xe2x80x9cdude, your 3D models are shit. This looks so bad.xe2x80x9dI would not have been able to say that to someone that I wasn't really good friends with. Think about it: you have someone who spends five days working almost 24/7 on one single render. You can't just come to them one day and tell them itxe2x80x99s bad and they have to start from scratch. He was a bit mad at first, but he accepted it pretty quickly.  And afterward, we got something that was way better because he saw the truth through my criticism. So this is the kind of relationship you need to have if you want to start really hard stuff together, whether it's an art project or a company.I have a lot of uncertainty about what I'm doing. I can call my software friends over the weekend and say xe2x80x9cokay guys, herexe2x80x99s a quick AI model for doing X. Letxe2x80x99s build a business out of it.xe2x80x9dAnd I know we can do it. I donxe2x80x99t know whether wexe2x80x99ll succeed, but Ixe2x80x99ll be able to do every single technical task around it. There are no fundamental roadblocks in terms of physics that stand in our way. With Foundation, we were working on this space thing, and even today where wexe2x80x99re doing something radically different, therexe2x80x99s some stuff thatxe2x80x94even if they donxe2x80x99t go against the fundamental laws of physicsxe2x80x94is still fricking hard. It's very hard as an outsider in a field to decide whether something is barely doable or completely impossible in a reasonable amount of time because this is where the frontier is. You don't really care about things that are surely doable. You don't care about things that are so trivially simple that even a child could do it. You care about the things that are just standing between doable and impossible.For Foundation, we had to basically draw the line and be like, okay, can we do that? Can this be part of a plan or is this too hard? And there's no way to figure it out in a reasonable amount of time. Anytime you work on something that is on a different tier of science and is really low in the technology of its scale, you will have those problems. The best part about Foundation is that it's cool. I can wake up one day and be like, xe2x80x9cOkay, today I'm going to read 40 papers about turning a specific mineral and lunar dust into pure titanium.xe2x80x9dAnd I'm going to find it super interesting because it's a different tier of science. I can speak with incredibly cool people. We have kids (and people of all ages) send us emails every week about wanting to work with us and do cool stuff with us.When you work on something that is hard, it becomes much easier to recruit. We have seen it as well. It becomes much easier to raise money. It becomes much easier to just get people to talk with you at cocktail parties when you tell them what you're doing.And this is very important. It might sound trivial, but the attractiveness of an idea is something that will open a lot of doors. Space itself is very cinematic, so people can watch rocket launches and they feel excited and they feel the thrill when the Falcon 9 thruster turns off because the rocket landed on the ground.When we started with the idea of doing Foundation in space, the theatricality of the plan was really helpful. We were able to make some renders in 2-3 days of a moon base, and sending that into peoplexe2x80x99s inboxes would almost always lead to a call. This is something people canxe2x80x99t say no to.The first step is to define who your customers are. There are different steps, and I think people have been so spoiled with the fact that with software, you can get customers from day one that they think itxe2x80x99s still the right thing to do.And it is the right thing to doxe2x80x94if you can do it. For most companies, yeah. But try to picture the early days of Tesla. You have some people in a garage that just bought a Lotus, and they tried to put a battery inside it and it doesn't even work yet. Imagine them trying to go around and being like xe2x80x9cHey dude, you look like a customer for us, how much will you pay for this hacked car that runs on electric motors instead of fuel?xe2x80x9dThis doesnxe2x80x99t really work. Itxe2x80x99s not a problem the customers have right now, it's just really hard to go through the classical playbook of trying to speak with customers early like you do when you build a SaaS product. When you work on things that are very hard and a differentiator, it just doesn't work. For Foundation, what we did is we tried to figure out whether people like SpaceX and NASA would eventually pay for this stuff.So I guess you can say that it's talking to customers. I think you can say that whatever you do is always talking with customers, right? Because anybody could be your customer. But I would say that in our case, we were trying to figure out how big the market was. And you can't do that by just Googling stuff online.Leopold was working at SpaceX and he asked SpaceX managers. xe2x80x9cWhat's the policy at SpaceX?xe2x80x9d SpaceX is famous for never buying stuff from outside contractors. They sometimes do, but they don't publicize it because they want their image to be of a company that does everything.But we asked them, xe2x80x9cLet's say you go to Mars and you need a fancy exoskeleton to protect your habitat. Would you buy it from other people?xe2x80x9d And they were like, yeah, sure. It depends on how expensive it is. What SpaceX actually does is if it's too expensive to do it in-house, they will buy it from other people.I think that when you're building for a market that doesn't exist yet, the most important question is when will it be ready? When will the market actually open? Imagine if tomorrow I can snap my fingers and be like, xe2x80x9cHey, I have the AWS of the moon and you can rent some excavators from us and get power and internet and whatever.xe2x80x9d Nobody would pay for that yet. Maybe NASA would give us some money because they'll be there soon, but the market is nonexistent.So when you build for a non-existent market, you really need to get your timeline and your Gantt charts right. You need to know when everything will be ready. It was fine for us if the marketxe2x80x99s not open now, because it would take us at least five years to achieve the things we promised doing. We had to time it very well because otherwise you just run out of money. If you build pickaxes when miners arenxe2x80x99t there yet, itxe2x80x99s dangerous. You have to time it with the gold rush. If you donxe2x80x99t time it well with the gold rush, you die.I think the lean startup is a plague.I really do think it's a plague because everybody does the same thing. I mean, it's great because it reduces uncertainty. It's like you're playing a video game, right? The video game is hard, but you know what the next level is, and you know what the final bosses and you know what the middle bosses are. When there is no playbook, there is way more uncertainty because you don't even know where you are. It's like when you're playing Dark Souls and you think you've killed the boss, but it's really only the first phase. And with the lean startup, you can actually quantify where you are because you have your DAU, you have your amount of money raised, your ARR, and you have all those numbers that depend on precisely where you are in the game and how to progress. And so it's all about reducing uncertainty. But when you do things that have uncertainty, it's really hard to actually know what the best path ahead is.There are industries that people are paying attention to, but not enough. I would say one that is very dear to my heart is formal verification of software. I really think that programming as it is right now is completely fucked up. It makes no sense that you spend more time fixing your programs than actually writing them.And you have those massive monoliths as a result of everything from Facebook to some simple components of bigger machines being quick-written. And it's fine because we just don't see it. Things go wrong so often that wexe2x80x99ve accepted it as a consequence of nature, but it shouldn't be the case.Some problems in computability are undecidable (like the halting problem)xe2x80x94you canxe2x80x99t actually check if a computer is bug-free. But there has been a lot of theory and research in the field of formal verification of software.Formal verification is being able to prove that a piece of code will respect the specifications we give it.For example, take Amazon S3. Itxe2x80x99s the Simple Storage Service of AWS. You can basically put files there and it's available everywhere on the Earth. They went through a lot of trouble to prove that the core functions of S3 respect the spec.Basically, they formally proved that the core part of S3 will never delete files itxe2x80x99s not supposed to delete.Formal verification is extremely difficult and we have to make it easier. The interesting thing is the whole blockchain thing injected a lot of money into the field because people wanted to formally verify contracts because you only write a contract once and then you put it on the blockchain and you canxe2x80x99t change it anymore. I mean, now you can, because there are upgradeable contracts, but let's say you canxe2x80x99t anymore for the sake of the argument. You want to make sure that people canxe2x80x99t just steal the money out of the contract, right? Picture a bunch of people in a spaceship going to the Sun for experiments or whatever, and then the whole ship just crashes. You have a blue screen of death because the spaceship runs on Windows embedded and nothing works. And this will happen. Linux is buggy. A lot of core pieces of software are buggy.Therexe2x80x99s a funny joke in the industry of software verification, where you have a bunch of dudes working on a missile. And one of the new engineers on the team talks with the manager and says xe2x80x9cthere is a memory leak in the missiles.xe2x80x9d And the manager says xe2x80x9cHey, it doesn't matter. The lifetime of the missile is 180 seconds. We added extra RAM so that the missile explodes before everything locks up.xe2x80x9d So it's actually quite funny because the way people deal with that right now is they just make software that reboots, or they just add more memory, or they make computers go faster.I really think that the more ambitious we are in terms of controlling the physical world, whether it be through deploying robots or building massive spaceships, the more important formal verification will become.We're going to approach this question from the eyes of entrepreneurs. We could approach it from so many different sets of eyesxe2x80x94it's both a problem of regulation, a problem of funding, and just a failure of the nerves from people to think that stuff is not possible.But letxe2x80x99s approach it from the perspective of young people.For someone who's like 20 years old, really smart, and wants to work on those problems, something you should not be doing (in my opinion) is focusing too much on short-term gains over long-term gains.Today, for smart people, it is very hard to sit down and go through the three books from The Feynman Lectures on Physics.Let's say you want to become good at physics.It's almost impossible to do it because every day on Twitter you have friends whoxe2x80x99ve raised 6 million to do crazy stuff. And so every single day, you open your books, and you take your notes and you start writing stuff, and you have to solve those equations. And every single day you tell yourself, why am I doing this?I could just go out and bullshit investors and build a company. And I think too many people actually do that. Myself included. I managed to resist for a while and I spent a lot of time learning different, difficult things, but it's very hard not to have ADD in this world. It's very hard to stay focused on important things that take a while to be learned.I think the reason why we see so many young people building short-term software companies is because the requirements are actually pretty low. Anybody can learn programming in six months and go out and build something that is big enough. And when it becomes very hard to scale, you just have to hire people. The problem is that this works for software, but when it comes to any other industries, like hardware or space or biology, I really don't think people can go and take five courses at a university and read 5 million blog posts and then build a company around that.They must be bullshitting themselves. And the problem is intellectual. Honesty is extremely important, both for yourself and for your sanity, but also when you work with others. And so I think that people should spend more time learning very hard stuff and be intellectually honest with themselves. And that means learning to improve.There's this thing called TKS in Canadaxe2x80x94The Knowledge Society. And it's a bunch of kids who are 16 years old and they take courses in quantum computing and brain/neural interfaces.And then those kids put it in their Twitter bio, xe2x80x9cI'm a quantum computer algorithmic designer at 16 years old.xe2x80x9d And thatxe2x80x99s cool. Those kids are super ambitious and they probably work hard, but there's no way they can actually do the things that they pretend to be doing. A friend I know mentioned a TKS guy who has blockchain developer on his Twitter bio. And the TKS guy asked him how to learn HTML and CSS. Don't try to go too fast for those things. Learning mathematics and physics properly is extremely hard. I'm not saying you need to do it for every single life path, but I'm saying that if you want to do something very hard in the physical world, there are prerequisites you canxe2x80x99t ditchxe2x80x94you have to go through them.Too many people these days are just trying to do things too fast and not waiting for two or three years. Waiting doesnxe2x80x99t mean youxe2x80x99re slacking off, youxe2x80x99re actually doing really hard things. Youxe2x80x99re basically fitting a bachelorxe2x80x99s and a masterxe2x80x99s in two years. This is the kind of stuff you need to do if you want to be able to build those super hard products you dream about. My one advice I would say is that just spend more time learning difficult stuff and don't try to take shortcuts too much because if your foundations are not good enough you will have problems along the way.I know other people would disagree with that, of course, but this is one of my stronger opinions.Go into physics or math. The thing is, whatever you do, being able to have very quick estimates, and having some rough rules when it comes to the dimensionality of things and stuff is super helpful.I would learn physics because I actually do think it's important. You're literally learning about the rules of the universe.So whatever you do, even if you just work with computers, physics is useful. Even if you want to tell yourself xe2x80x9cI wanna be a software guy, I donxe2x80x99t have to care about the hardware.xe2x80x9d Well, learning how the universe works will always give you an edge over people who donxe2x80x99t know how it works.You can follow Justin on Twitter at @JustinGlibert if you havenxe2x80x99t already.

Hexe2x80x99s a college student currently working at Lux Capital, one of the most active VC firms investing in emerging technologies. Rahul takes us through how to think like a moonshot founder, thoughts on the current state of deep tech, and maximizing serendipity. Rahulxe2x80x99s book, Making Moonshots, is out now.Buy Rahul's BookMy name is Rahul Rana, Ixe2x80x99m currently a sophomore at Rutgers studying finance and astrophysics. My passion for deep tech started as a kidxe2x80x94my dad works at Bell Labs. As a kid, hexe2x80x99d always bring me to the labs to look at their Nobel Prize winners, all their inventions, and their new cool research. Ixe2x80x99d go into actual research labs and play around with all the fancy gadgets and tools and became obsessed with all things science and breakthrough tech.Funnily enough, once I got to high school, I blocked off all that curiosity and fell into the finance and business crowd. I thought I was gonna go into investment banking when I got into college. But when I got to college, I realized that I wanted to go back to my roots and combine the two: finance and deep tech. I wanted to do something bold. Around this time I decided I had all this passion, all this energy, I wanted to do something with it. I got this awesome opportunity to write this book. I donxe2x80x99t know if it was luck or serendipity, but it just came at the right time. I found the right mentor (a professor at Georgetown) and hexe2x80x99s been coaching me the entire time, really helping set me up with a publisher and stuff.Outside of the book, Ixe2x80x99ve interned at an AI startup, a nanotech startup, and 2 other VC firms in content creation roles. But in terms of the book itself, I started in January, Ixe2x80x99ve been writing it ever since. Ixe2x80x99ve met some awesome people and became tight with partners at VC firms, founders, people like that. I started building communities, creating content around this topic, and really trying to build a reputation around all things in deep tech.  Therexe2x80x99s a lot to it. A moonshot is a really lofty, seemingly-impossible goal to reach. Itxe2x80x99s a metaphor for the Apollo Missions. I wanted to apply that concept to startups. Moonshots are a 3-part spectrum. You take some sort of advanced technology (deep tech), you use it in a radically creative solution, and solve some big problem in the world. I call it more of a spectrum than a concrete framework because there are varying degrees of how you can apply it.So how to make said moonshot? Well, therexe2x80x99s a couple of things. In my book, I break it down into 4 categories: Psychology (mindset)PhilosophiesStrategiesEcosystemI specifically try not to make it a boring business management book. I wanted it to be something thatxe2x80x99s fun, dynamic, and interesting. Looking at deep tech from all different angles, instead of just business.You have to be radically creative. You need to be extremely optimistic, but also a pessimist. Be super naive, but also be grounded in reality. All of these seemingly-opposing qualities. You also have your typical founder personality traits. Ambitious, bold, contrarian, disruptive, all these different qualities I break down and give examples for in my book.At the end of the day, itxe2x80x99s about being an exception. Itxe2x80x99s about being a complex level of genius, but itxe2x80x99s a level that anyone can harness. Itxe2x80x99s so accessible. Itxe2x80x99s not something that only Elon Musk can harness. I try to dispel all those myths and I give a tangible toolkit on how to actually do so. Itxe2x80x99s actually actionable. Ixe2x80x99m not gonna say something like xe2x80x9cbe creative.xe2x80x9d I show you how some of the best founders do it.Philosophy is about being resilient, rethinking failure, and being wise. Being wise is huge. Use mental models. I have a whole list of 11 mental models in the book as an homage to Apollo 11. The book also incorporates a lot of theories about human potential. Moonshot foundersxe2x80x94people who do this deep tech stuffxe2x80x94theyxe2x80x99re really maximizing their human potential. I go into some stories that I hear from these founders, some awesome things that got them hyped up and inspired to work on these problems. My favorite is this one theory that says that all life on Earth is the remnants of dead stars. A supernova releases all these elements and materials. After a long time, those elements somehow got to Earth, created life, and thus came us. Itxe2x80x99s inspiring to me that wexe2x80x99re the remnants of dead stars because it means we should be doing things of cosmic magnitude. Strategy entails a bunch of things. Therexe2x80x99s a whole discussion on how to get started on the problem and whatxe2x80x99s the right problem to solve. Strategy also entails that moonshots are for everyonexe2x80x94itxe2x80x99s not just for conventional experts or rich people. Anyone can go about making a moonshot and I dispel those myths, revealing all the non-obvious factors in doing so. The book goes into pitching and storytelling, which is really important for all things deep tech because thatxe2x80x99s how you get customers, how you raise capital, how you acquire talent, all those sorts of things. You also need to de-risk it. Because a moonshot is super risky,  you need to make the journey as doable as possible. I also go into leveraging all those cutting/bleeding edge technologies we have today. Science fiction and science fact, all those cool strategies.You have to really leverage the ecosystem around a moonshot. The book talks about startups, VC/investing, the government, education, and finally the secondary players: accelerators, incentives, media, and entertainment.Your best startups know how to harness all aspects of that ecosystem. They partner with the government, and with university research labs. They usually get their breakthroughs to commercialize from university research labs, as well as talent from those labs. I go through the whole commercialization process, and also look at it from a VC perspective: how do you fix VC to support more moonshots? How do you fix the government to support more moonshots?People on your cap table should have these 3 qualities:WisdomPatienceBelief in progressIn my book, I talk a lot about making wise companies. Itxe2x80x99s so important to have a wise company as much as it is to have a profitable one. That also goes for investors as well. You want people who are wise. Theyxe2x80x99re really looking to see the company grow, out of their appreciation for science and all things tech. Ixe2x80x99ve just realized that the investors who actually care about the product at hand do so much better than the ones that give you the money and leave, or the ones that donxe2x80x99t support the mission and vision of what youxe2x80x99re doing. Itxe2x80x99s so simple yet so important, but you should also bring on those who want to see some good in the world and have long-term visions. Most investors want quick wins and as a result of how incentives are set up in venture capital.If you look at incentives, itxe2x80x99s obvious that people value software and consumer a lot more than deep tech because if you want quick winsxe2x80x943-5 years is the standard lifecycle of a fund and thatxe2x80x99s when you should get a solid company and quick returns out of that.Deep tech operates on a much longer timeframe, so you need investors that understand that. These investors might come from academia or just really understand the sales cycle, product development cycle, and R&D stages that other software/consumer investors wouldnxe2x80x99t really understand. You want the investors that believe in progress. Your investors should have that acumen and skillset for understanding the qualities of deep tech and all the industries that make up deep tech. People that really understand the markets themselves. Commercial viability is absolutely huge. At the end of the day, itxe2x80x99s a company. If you want VC backing, it has to have a solid business model and reach profitability at some point in time. The business plan and model are so important.That said, it depends on where you are as a company. In the way beginning, you need to focus on the team. Are these the only people in the world who can make this company successful? If that answer is yes, then you know youxe2x80x99re on to something. Once a company gets started, the most important thing is getting commercial viability. We have all these fancy technology breakthroughs going on in the world. Mind control is real, we have 3D printing factories for the moon, we have all those super-advanced things. At the end of the day, what matters most is whether or not people adopt that technology. Can you make an actual business out of these breakthroughs?When it comes to demarcating whether or not someonexe2x80x99s an actual founder or a fraud, storytelling is huge. If you look at Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, she over-storytold. She storytold so much that she tricked people into believing her for the longest time. You have to find the right balance between under-storytelling and over-storytelling. Get people curious, get them excited, but allow the investors to put the puzzle pieces together. Tell them just enough so they themselves understand that the technology is huge, but let them do the critical thinking. Storytell to the perfect level that gets them excited enough for them to realize by themselves that this will become huge.Letxe2x80x99s say you have conviction in a founder and decided that theyxe2x80x99re legit. After that, you need to look at the technology itself. A lot of deep tech investors have in-house resident experts, EIRs, or they have connections within academia or other industries, and they would consult those people. Having a network of expertise is important in realizing whether or not a technology is for real or not. At the end of the day, the technology has to work. Itxe2x80x99s so intuitive, but many people get it wrong. Nobody asked Elizabeth Holmes if her technology worked. Everyone just assumed that it did. Itxe2x80x99s surprising that nobody asked Theranos if their technology worked, and at the end of the day it didnxe2x80x99txe2x80x94there wasnxe2x80x99t even a product. A solid mental model for realizing whether or not a moonshot idea can work is: does the technology work? There has to be an achievable journey to get to viability. There needs to be this very specific, tractable journey to get the evidence of whether it works or not.Ixe2x80x99ve always said to people: when it comes to moonshots, founders need bold goals in their long-term visions, but in the medium and short term, they need to be extremely clear and doable about what theyxe2x80x99re going to do every month or so. Those short-term goals canxe2x80x99t be bold. They need to be a lot more achievable.R&D labs like PARC or DARPA are bringing smart people all around the world together to work on some awesome bold thing that inspires them. A lot of these things are very intuitive and many people miss them, but getting people excited about a common goal or vision is huge. Especially if you can get really smart people excited. Things like the Manhattan Project and Apollo missions are examples of that. Once you get people excited and incentivize them to win, theyxe2x80x99re going to do what they do bestxe2x80x94make breakthroughs.Ixe2x80x99d break it down into 3 things:You need an internal infrastructure within the organization to incentivize people and make for a solid ecosystem.You need a social/cultural attitude that inspires people.You need the social incentive, whether that be benefits, money, or status, to intrinsically motivate people to work on big ideas.If you have those 3 things, that makes for a solid research organization.Therexe2x80x99s one single argument against my entire book, and thatxe2x80x99s moonshots are expensive. I recognize that. They require some money. But nonetheless, that doesnxe2x80x99t mean itxe2x80x99s only for rich people. Anyone can do it, but therexe2x80x99s just a higher barrier to entry as opposed to software. Those barriers to entry are decreasing ever so slightly year over year, but ideally: deep tech should be like software, where you can build things in your bedroom or garage. Wexe2x80x99re not at that stage yet. We canxe2x80x99t lie to ourselves. But hopefully, with more resources and awareness around deep tech, those barriers will go down and itxe2x80x99ll be less expensive to do things. For example, the cost of gene editing went down exponentially since the 90s. Therexe2x80x99s a lot of things like that. Itxe2x80x99s still relatively high compared to all things software, but itxe2x80x99s slowly going down and within the next decade, I think deep tech is going to really boom because of these lower barriers to entry.We have regular creativity, which is about making connections with a linear assumption of the future. You make all these new ideas and connections, but itxe2x80x99s assuming that progress is linear. Itxe2x80x99s about making new things out of existing things. Radical creativity assumes a nonlinear future with exponential possibilities. Nothing incremental. Itxe2x80x99s radical because youxe2x80x99re making newer things out of new things in a forward-thinking context. With radical creativity, youxe2x80x99re pushing the boundaries of whatxe2x80x99s possible and being on the outermost edges of science and tech. In terms of actually how to harness it, radically creative individuals have a lot of seemingly-opposing qualities. Theyxe2x80x99re charismatic and extroverted, but also quiet and introverted at the same time. Theyxe2x80x99re super smart, but also naive. Theyxe2x80x99re playful but also grounded in reality. Theyxe2x80x99re passionately dispassionate. Theyxe2x80x99re responsibly irresponsible. The harmony between these opposing traits is what defines a radically creative person. A lot of the best founders also have a relentless curiosity to learn more about a given field and become obsessed with it.On the flip side, radical creativity is also about having a growth mindset and a desire to improve oneself. Maybe itxe2x80x99s also about growing up with challenges, which builds character. There are so many ways to do it.I would recommend someone keep those qualities in mind, but also ask very uncomfortable questions. Figure out what you want your human potential to be. Experience and explore lots of different things. Question assumptions, do unsexy things, brainstorm freely, align yourself with the super lofty goal, operate at the extremes, and have a contagious passion for something. Maximize serendipity. I can go on and on, but thatxe2x80x99s what really spurs radical creativity.Most research breakthroughs start with PhDs, but itxe2x80x99s not necessarily the ideal state to be for a startup. I have a subchapter in my book called Moonshots are for Everyone. Ixe2x80x99m a sophomore business major in college. I have no background in deep tech, and yet Ixe2x80x99m writing this book. I can hold conversations with experts, and I wrote an entire publishable book about this topic.The easy example that everyone knows is Elon Musk. He only has a bachelorxe2x80x99s degree in physics and economics. That by no means makes him an expert in anything deep tech. And Ixe2x80x99d say hexe2x80x99s not an exception. We should view Elon Musk as a normal human being. There are more people out there that donxe2x80x99t have the media attention that Elon does. And what he and all these people have in common is that theyxe2x80x99re incredibly resourceful. The internet made access to resources easier. Moonshot founders are resourceful enough to take all of that information from the internet and figure out what they need to do. But it all starts with the mindset. You need a mindset like Elon, Laura Deming, Naveen Jain, Sam Altman, etc. These people arenxe2x80x99t experts with credentials. They donxe2x80x99t have PhDs, and yet theyxe2x80x99re making the most impactful companies out there. It goes back to being relentlessly resourceful and talking to the right people. Itxe2x80x99s as simple as cold-emailing experts. Literally, Laura Deming cold-emailed a professor in the US as a 12-year-old in New Zealand. And that was enough to get her that research position at age 12. Using whatever you have to your advantage and maximizing serendipity however you can and putting in the work. Credentialed and non-credentialed experts are not more or less important than each other, but non-credentialed experts can be equally as effective as credentialed ones in terms of startups.Ixe2x80x99m at Rutgers. Itxe2x80x99s a non-targeted school. I came into the tech world with absolutely no connections. All I knew going to college was finance. I actually came from a 4-year business administration magnet program in high school. Ixe2x80x99m not technical whatsoever. I made those personal connections by literally cold-emailing, by jumping on Twitter, and creating content. Maximize serendipity. Thatxe2x80x99s the way to go for everything.To get interviews for my book, I would really research the person and their background. I would identify things that they really like or things that stand out and look for patterns within all the content that they create. I throw in all those buzzwords that they like into my cold emails. My one for Josh Wolfe when I first emailed him, I would throw in all of his little phrases and words he would say in every single podcast and essay. He always says some of these words, and I used them to make a hyper-personalized, really concise email. I got him and 50 other experts that no college kid has ever talked to. Twitter was also huge for me. I only started tweeting in May, and Ixe2x80x99m almost at 900 followers by just being really active and engaging and creating a solid stream of articles and thoughts. Ixe2x80x99d say all things deep tech are underrated. Literally, nobody is giving attention to it. Tech Twitter is a bubble, but in the real world, nobody knows about anything deep tech, biotech, and defense tech. With GPT-3, which came out in June or so, everyone on Tech Twitter was raving about it. I was looking through traditional news media and Reddit, and nobody has heard of it. Ixe2x80x99d tell them about it and theyxe2x80x99re like xe2x80x9choly shit, when did this come out?xe2x80x9dI saw this thread on Reddit where they were talking about the next up and coming technology and only one person mentioned GPT-3, and their comments section was huge and everyone was like xe2x80x9cwait, what is that? Ixe2x80x99ve never heard of thatxe2x80x9d and it was so funny to me. The next super company is going to be deep tech, whether itxe2x80x99s drug discovery or a space company. But I think biotech is going to be absolutely huge. Thatxe2x80x99s going to be a trillion-dollar industry, easily. I think itxe2x80x99s because of its versatility. Wexe2x80x99re at the stage where biotech is starting to act like software. Just like how you can write code, you can write DNA. Sequencing, editing, and making drugs are becoming so much easier. You can use biotech to help mitigate climate change. You can use it to cure diseases. You can use it to improve the health of people in inner-cities. It has national security applications and even branched into the automotive industry. All of those things, biotech can solve. Thatxe2x80x99s my lifexe2x80x99s goal: get all the solid talent away from big tech. Saving lives is so much more important than maximizing advertising revenue.Not everyone wants to work on a risky moonshot. People have different financial situations, passions, interests, and circumstances. Working at a big tech company provides solid pay and benefits, and they can also be a great environment for mentorship and learning. People at big tech companies do great work, but those smart people could also be working on more impactful problems. At the end of the day, you need to fix the incentive structure. You need to get more funding and attention towards deep tech. With deep tech, what Ixe2x80x99ve realized is that itxe2x80x99s so easy to align yourself with the mission and vision of the company. Everyone wants to do good in the world, and thatxe2x80x99s what deep tech does across any industry. However, you need to give them the right pay, benefits, ecosystem, and culture. Once you can do that, you need media attention. To get more people into deep tech, we need to increase the social status of the people who are in that industry. The way I look at it is this is: FAANG and high finance are so popular because theyxe2x80x99re incredibly competitive. Because theyxe2x80x99re competitive, the pay is larger. Because the pay is larger, the more smartest of the smartest are competing for that position. If we could have that flywheel in deep tech, itxe2x80x99s going to boom.I have no idea. I asked people for career-building advice on Twitter.November 30th 2020What Ixe2x80x99m thinking ofxe2x80x94on a high-levelxe2x80x94is to build a reputation around moonshots. My absolute dream job is a full-time position at Lux because they also incubate companies in-house, so itxe2x80x99ll be really cool for me to be both a venture investor and a venture builder.I want to build this personal brand around moonshots and create more content, jump on podcasts, inspire people. Ixe2x80x99m thinking of making a community around the book, though Ixe2x80x99m not sure yet. Itxe2x80x99s just a process of developing that personal brand while also building skills. I really wanna build the skills to be a value-add in the deep tech space, which is why Ixe2x80x99m a minor in astrophysics so I can learn more about all things deep tech. I do want to have a solid following on Twitter and other media accounts, so I can become a go-to person for moonshots. How am I going to do that? Ixe2x80x99m still figuring it out, but those are the next steps once the book is published.Rahulxe2x80x99s book, Making Moonshots, is out now!Buy Rahul's BookYou can follow Rahul on Twitter at @rrana03_ if you havenxe2x80x99t already.

Before that, he started a VR company, a nonprofit, and was even featured on CNN Money at age 16. Suds was kind enough to give us a detailed look at his journey building Fion without a heavy technical background, some advice on moving fast, and his thoughts on doing hard things.At Fion, we try to prevent fires before they start. Once they start, we use satellite imagery to detect them faster than anybody else, we predict where theyxe2x80x99re going to spread, and then we estimate how much damage the fires are going to cost. Wexe2x80x99ve got 3-4 data scientists, a sales guy, a sales intern that works under him, our CTO that manages the entire development, and then me. When we were early on in the product development cycle, we talked to a bunch of potential customers. Initially, it started off as fire departments, then graduated to forestry services, then state-level people like sheriffxe2x80x99s offices and organizations that were coordinating multi-county regional fire response efforts. And then we finally started talking to insurance companies and financial institutions and trying to figure out what they want in the product. Once wexe2x80x99ve figured that out, we worked on figuring out what we should triage and prioritize, and what was the key product offering that we needed to provide in order to have an MVP that we can sell. Once we'd figured out what we needed in the product, we started building it and we started trying to do sales before we had something. So a lot of our days were just calling people, talking to people, understanding why we werenxe2x80x99t being able to sell.A lot of my time also goes toward answering emails. It seems trivial, but wexe2x80x99re looking at big partnerships and most of our sales stuff gets done over email and 15-minute Zoom calls. So itxe2x80x99s a lot of emails, used to be a lot of hiring, used to be a lot of product stuff, now itxe2x80x99s more about trying to get sales done.Fundraising also looks very similar, where I have meetings every day. Today, I started off with meetings because I do angel investing on the side, and then I spend a lot of time trying to understand how other people are running their companies and what I could be doing better. I do standups with my entire team throughout the week. I just ask them what help do you need and itxe2x80x99s my job to make that help appear. Letxe2x80x99s say we need access to an API, or maybe a data source goes down, or something needs to be faster. Ixe2x80x99m the one going in and finding the right engineer or the right partner that can solve that problem.Ixe2x80x99ve been limiting myself to about 3-4 meetings per day. Meetings are only for critical things, although I occasionally have office hours 12 hours a week where people can sign up to get help.Other than meetings, what you donxe2x80x99t see on the calendar is basic clerk work. Wexe2x80x99re not a massive company, so it doesnxe2x80x99t make sense for us to hire a general counsel to fill out the paperwork for us. I let my technical team set their own deadlines. I tell them xe2x80x9cHey, we need something, you guys get it done.xe2x80x9d If we have a hard deadline, Ixe2x80x99m like, xe2x80x9cHey we need it done by this. What can you get done?xe2x80x9d and help them spec it. If we canxe2x80x99t get something done by the deadline, we triage and prioritize to figure out the most important things we need for whatever the project is. Beyond that, Ixe2x80x99ll say xe2x80x9cherexe2x80x99s a hard deadline, get it done, how long is it going to take to get this done?xe2x80x9d If we donxe2x80x99t have a deadline, letxe2x80x99s cut our estimate in half and get the first version out in half the time. We are very deep tech, so a lot of this you canxe2x80x99t say xe2x80x9chey letxe2x80x99s ship half the features.xe2x80x9d Things usually take 3x longer to ship. My job comes from figuring out where the redundancies are and where my team is still thinking that theyxe2x80x99re in academia instead of business. I try to help them adjust to that. They understand we need to move fast and they understand we have a lot of things to do, so the team themselves are going to set good achievable goals.Fion sells to governments and insurance companies, which normally have lots of bureaucracy involved that prevent people from making decisions quickly. How do you move fast in an environment like this?A lot of it comes down to your mentality. The traditional sales cycle is 6-9 months for governments. For insurance companies, itxe2x80x99s probably longer. Where we really shine is wexe2x80x99re not just sending the intro email and calling it a day. Wexe2x80x99re looking at it and asking questions like hey, this is a new avenue/industry/segment. How can we attack it? Who do we know? Who should we be talking to? Can we get 10,000 emails out? Is this a numbers game? What are the different segments?A long sales cycle doesnxe2x80x99t stop you from iterating fast. For example, our API is our core product and from there we have a dashboard and other structures because you donxe2x80x99t just sell a bare API. You need to structure and package it for a customer. And so for the API, wexe2x80x99re asking ourselves: what is the fastest way to get that out the door? What information do our customers need? Our customers simply need to know where fires are and where theyxe2x80x99ll go. That doesnxe2x80x99t require a dashboard. It can be an email or text notification at first, then you can build a dashboard backward from there.Itxe2x80x99s about how fast you can iterate on the product, how fast you can talk to potential customers and figure out what they need and donxe2x80x99t need. You donxe2x80x99t just need to be physically faster, but you also need a mindset shift of constant iteration and forward momentum.Youxe2x80x99ve talked about how before building Fion, youxe2x80x99ve been doing insane amounts of research on fires. Whatxe2x80x99s your learning process like?I talk to people, I used to read all the time but ever since I've found Twitter Ixe2x80x99ve decided to stop reading textbooks. I could have learned about fires by reading research papers, and I did. I read so many research papers, and I typically never do that.But most of my learning came from calling up people whoxe2x80x99ll never give us a contract in the first place, like a fire chief. Even though we couldnxe2x80x99t sell to them, they still spent 2 hours just educating me about every part of what they do, all their problems, and the general workflow. I used to get on 5-10 calls per day. I used to not close a single one and it was really embarrassing because I wasnxe2x80x99t sure what I was doing wrong. But part of that is because we didnxe2x80x99t have a product, and we didnxe2x80x99t know how to sell without a product.Mockups and visuals. You can even simply ask customers about their problems, then tell them: what if we gave you a product that just solves those problems? Would you use it? If yes, cool. Letxe2x80x99s sign an LOI, letxe2x80x99s make your life easier. Itxe2x80x99s pretty simple. Tell me your problems and Ixe2x80x99ll tell you how wexe2x80x99re gonna help you solve it.Fundraising isnxe2x80x99t about valuation, itxe2x80x99s about looking long term and asking how does the cap table look at series B and C, what are we building for, and what is that money going towards. Right now, our investors are investing in the team, our knowledge moat, and the idea of what Fion could be. Theyxe2x80x99re not investing based on sales numbers and metrics. And also wexe2x80x99re a little bit differentxe2x80x94especially with me being non-technical. Some people might think wexe2x80x99re a pure SaaS company, but wexe2x80x99re actually deep tech. So concerning valuation, people need to be coming at it from the viewpoint of a deep tech company. Wexe2x80x99ve been in development for 10 months. Even if Google or Amazon wanted to throw their PhDs at it, theyxe2x80x99re still going to run into the same problems we did. Having a bunch more smart people in a room doesnxe2x80x99t change anything when the technology is evolving on a literally daily basis. Machine learning is literally improving every day, in terms of where the boundaries are and whatxe2x80x99s possible. Our team is just as fast and agile as any other big companyxe2x80x99s team will be, and wexe2x80x99ve got a first-mover advantage. Version zero looked like a consumer tool that notified people if a fire was coming close to their house. Our angel was Josh Browder from DoNotPay and he built a very successful business out of $3 MRR. So I was like, that would be a great place to start and prove out the efficacy of our model. What ended up happening was that it wasnxe2x80x99t worth diverting all of our resources into a consumer product just for the sake of revenue. Even if it gets us from zero to one, it wasnxe2x80x99t going to be sustainable enough to take us from 1 to 100. So we decided that it was a complete waste of time and we went back to the drawing board and started talking to fire departments to understand what they actually want.Before building Fion, Suds founded Second Reality Interactive in 2018xe2x80x94a company that built a virtual hangout space for watching Twitch in VR with your friends. The vision was to create a space where anyone, regardless of location or physical ability, to gather with friends or have conferences and meetings. Second Reality shut down in March 2020.I still donxe2x80x99t know 90% of the things I think I should know now, but I knew zero of the things I should have known running Second Reality, which was really rough. I didnxe2x80x99t have a good understanding of how you get a product from being an idea to being a product. I started developing that understanding over time with other ancillary projects Ixe2x80x99ve worked on (like SaveMAPS), but it wasnxe2x80x99t until Gen Z Mafia where I was doing a drop every 3 days and also PMing every single one. In my head, Ixe2x80x99ve basically got it down to a systematic process of how to get from idea to spec to building a team to launching, and then from launch to generating hype. Those things I was able to codify in my head even if I couldnxe2x80x99t explain it. And from the business side, I mean, coming in completely cold totally just knocked me off my feet because I had no idea what I was doing with Second Reality. At Fion, wexe2x80x99re an 8-figure company and we still didnxe2x80x99t have some basic things done, so wexe2x80x99re still learning. But Second Reality was more of a way to learn how do you build a product, how do you get it shipped, what does that mean, how do you fundraise, and why is that so hard? And then from that first failure comes a lot of learning experiences.Right now, the tech for VR isnxe2x80x99t there. A VR headset is running on a chip thatxe2x80x99s at minimum 2 years old. You wonxe2x80x99t get an ARM processor until 2022 (if theyxe2x80x99re even thinking about that). The emphasis hasnxe2x80x99t been on making the tech exponentially better, but on making it incrementally cheaper or more accessible. And so those are the real problems in the VR space, and I donxe2x80x99t see the economies of scale part getting there anytime soon. All the PhDs are at Google wasting their lives, and anyone else that can build anything is working on ads for Zuckerberg or wasting their life at Apple. The people that could be building better hardware to move an industry forward are not doing it because theyxe2x80x99ve been bought out.One of my biggest theses is xe2x80x9cif you wanna make a trillion dollars, youxe2x80x99re not doing that if youxe2x80x99re making an app that lets you push a button to get something delivered at a ten-billion dollar valuation. Thatxe2x80x99s fundamentally kneecapping yourself. For me, I always want to be swinging for the fences because youxe2x80x99ve only got to be right once. And when youxe2x80x99re right once, youxe2x80x99re making a 100 billion, or a trillion dollars on the high endxe2x80x94not just a billion. I donxe2x80x99t really see myself doing something besides Fion in the future because therexe2x80x99s a lot of maneuverability. At one point, we could expand into computing services. We also need to throw up our own satellites to get our own data faster than what NASA can give us, and therexe2x80x99s a lot you can do with a satellite that greatly expands our product offerings and ancillary services.The thing about deep tech is that most of what people would consider xe2x80x9cdeep techxe2x80x9d isnxe2x80x99t some new groundbreaking thing. Itxe2x80x99s more about taking things that have been in academia for X amount of time and getting that from a technology readiness level (TRL) in the 4-6 range to a TRL of 9. And then taking the business side from zero to ten. This is where you need an operatorxe2x80x94or someone who understands how to do salesxe2x80x94to work with academics and bring people together around a vision and goal rather than just saying xe2x80x9cWexe2x80x99re gonna pay you $200k for thisxe2x80x9d. The biggest mental shift you need to make is that academics are super risk-averse. In academia, your research is your reputationxe2x80x94itxe2x80x99s your name. When youxe2x80x99re in tech and you need to move fast, those different mindsets clash. And so itxe2x80x99s more about sitting academics down and trying to figure out the happy medium where theyxe2x80x99re comfortable slapping their name on it but also lets you keep moving at a startup-level pace. I think itxe2x80x99s about incentive alignment and risk. I think most people donxe2x80x99t have the conviction to go all-in on themselves. Something Ixe2x80x99ve realized is that people donxe2x80x99t all want to be amazing. They just want to do their thing and die. 95% of people are just here to die. Itxe2x80x99s about finding the right people who want to take the swing and then figuring out how to give them the resources that empower them to try and swing for the fences. And thatxe2x80x99s basically what a VC does. I think itxe2x80x99s important to look for people who are self-starters. You can probably develop or train for it, but I donxe2x80x99t think finding people who have potential and trying to change their entire mentality and mindset works every time. Itxe2x80x99s a lot easier to take someone whoxe2x80x99s hungry and try to scale them up to a certain level rather than take someone whoxe2x80x99s smart and has no ambition.I think our trajectory would be to build all the software and get the physical infrastructure (like satellites) in place to verticalize fire response and understand everything about fires. Once wexe2x80x99re there, why stop at selling to insurance companies and hedge funds? Why not become an insurance company? Why not start trading derivatives and futures and start looking beyond fires? After that, we want to become a data provider for extreme weather. Why not look beyond fires for other natural disasters and extreme weather events and become a data provider, like Clearbit for natural disasters? You can follow Sudarshan on Twitter at @itzSuds if you havenxe2x80x99t already.

I will keep adding to it.  If youxe2x80x99re working on one of the below problems, feel free to reach out. I may also add a thread for solutions. Keep in mind that many of the problems likely have working approaches (e.g. grid resilience is an active research field), but Ixe2x80x99m highlighting the problems here because I think they are underrated for their worth. [1] Context: Topics below were drafted before the events of January 6, the debates on social media de-platforming, and the exodus from WhatsApp to Signal and Telegram. I stand by my below comments, especially my views on ads as a monetization model (Telegram, please donxe2x80x99t). The post was longer than intended, especially Point 2 where I tried to avoid going down the adtech. rabbit hole, but failed. If youxe2x80x99re not interested in me lamenting the demise of products due to ads models, you should go ahead and skip number 2, and read only the bolded. I lightly edited the below for clarity in light of recent events. Corrections always welcome.  Digital resilience and preservation. The problem here is the fragility of digital content systems. Resilience. If electricity goes out, how long does it take for us to restore communication and power? How easy is it to cause outage? Can we turn our phone off for more than a day, two days, a week, a month? See Nashville for a recent example for why Ixe2x80x99m worried about this. Content preservation. Much of historical accounts is now preserved digitally. We take crawler services like Wayback Machine for granted - what will happen to content in 50, 100, 150 years? Who will decide on what to and when to maintain? Are we ok with the implicit privatisation of libraries (implicit in a few people end up deciding what digital content to archive, and people default to these accounts due to a lack of alternatives)? On a personal level, if something bad happens to your cloud storage provider, do you have content backups? See Azure and Gmail 2020 outage for a recent example of not having access to a scarily large amount of your own content. Deleted Twitter replies is a minor but frustrating example of this. [2]Decreasing reliance on AdTech for digital monetization. The problem here is that ads lower content and experience quality, and that there are not many great monetization alternatives for content-driven companies. See summary at end of bullet point. One possibility is transitioning to subscription-based models (e.g traditional media approach on digital monetization or Substack itself). Would you pay Facebook and Twitter a monthly fee if they promised no ads, and no data sharing? Ad models create problems in digital content distribution. When I talk about ads here, I mean exclusively platform ad displays, and not sponsored creator posts. Lots of people have made smart observations on this topic. I wonxe2x80x99t try to substantiate that ads enhanced social media polarisation (beware: USC paper linked in the Wired article is a draft) or monopolised product marketplaces. I also wonxe2x80x99t try to substantiate that ads monetization necessitate privacy trade-offs (DuckDuckGo is one such counterexample). That this article needs to exist or that Apple adding user privacy features cost companies ad revenue hopefully say enough. For one reason or another, advertisement is the default primary monetization model for content-based tech. companies. These companies include Google (70.7% total revenue from ads), Tencent (16%, mostly WeChat), Facebook (98.5%), Twitter (86%), Snapchat (62.6%), ByteDance (60%), and Reddit ($119 million, unk. total) for a total combined ad revenue of $ 214 billion USD est. 2019. To my untrained marketing eyes, ads bundled with content and search isnxe2x80x99t the most ideal solution for users or advertisers (see Search case study). Proctor & Gamble cut their digital ads. spending by $200 million in 2018, with little to no impact on its revenue. Given that intent to buy is difficult to proxy well, some doubt is cast on the effectiveness of digital ads for advertisers.  Ads fund much of our digital content. If ads become unbundled from media and search, how we consume content would be vastly different. Mark Zuckerberg himself published a 2019 note citing a desire to find a non-ad based monetization model for messages that allows for more privacy (ironic given the things we know about WhatsApp in 2021). Ixe2x80x99m not sure if the answer here is trying other monetization models (e.g. subscriptions), or a separate, ads-only platform for users with intent to buy. Whoever cracks this can change digital content and platforms as we know it. Case Study: Better Search. Google (88.14%) and Bing (6.18%) take up roughly 95% of the worldwide search engine market in 2020 [source: statista]. At a glance, it seems unwise to challenge search incumbents, given the sheer size of compute and engineering ingenuity that has gone into the making. However, there are unchallenged assumptions in the current landscape that could pave way for a much different future. Ads are annoying for users. AdBlock extensions are popular for a reason. People shown a given Google ad click on average only 2% of the time. The difference to me between a relevant search result and platform-generated ad spot is that the former has every intent to buy, while the latter does not necessarily measure intent. Itxe2x80x99s possible to show only product search results, and sell bidding spots for those exclusively (e.g. Amazon but for every store), without embedding it into the rest of platform content. When there is no intent to buy, ads are annoying for users. Ads arenxe2x80x99t effective for ad purchasers without user intent to buy, which is often not the case. Even the most committed, financially viable user may not want to click away to a vacuum ad link on YouTube (the same is not necessarily true for sponsored YouTube creator content). See previous P&G example. If as a seller, you need to spend lots on ad budgets, 200 SEO factors to filter intent to buy, and multiple site pop-ups to force users to abandon their ad-blockers, maybe youxe2x80x99re forcing an impossible sell. It shouldnxe2x80x99t have to be this complicated. So why is search (and media) bundled with ads? Brief History Tangent. There are lots of other problems associated with ad-based search I wonxe2x80x99t mention here. Personalized digital ads has now become a complicated central art form to campaigns and marketing, but when and why did it get this way? Rise of ad-giants: Sergey Brin and Larry Page in their original 1998 paper (paper which presented Google for the first time to the world) did not like ad-based business models.  xe2x80x9cFor this type of reason and historical experience with other media, we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers xe2x80xa6 In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines. However, there will always be money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products, or have something that is genuinely new. But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.xe2x80x9dThis attitude shifted (largely seemingly thanks to Bill Gross and GoTo.com in one way or another). In the first Google shareholder letter, the founders remarked that xe2x80x9cAdvertising is our principal source of revenue, and the ads we provide are relevant and useful rather than intrusive and annoying.xe2x80x9d Ad-based search has since seemed to be taken for granted as the way of life (even for engines such as DuckDuckGo).While I was not in the rooms where media startup founders decided to choose ads for monetization, from what we know it seems that even champions of ads are wary of its limitations. Perhaps it is time to question the default. Tl;dr: Ads models bundle separate problems that may have better individual solutions. It is the default monetization model, but perhaps for a lack of a better alternative. For an industry that moves fast and breaks things, perhaps it is time to move fast and break free from ad models. Governance OKRs. The problem here is that we donxe2x80x99t have a good incentives framework for performance outside of polls and approval. [3] Consensus on need, no consensus on action. Why are there problems that a majority find important but arenxe2x80x99t incentivized or paid to work on (e.g. why does it take so long and so much energy for negative externalities such as climate change to be recognized and regulated)? The tempting default seems to be inaction when there is a consensus on need but no consensus on approach. Governance Performance Dashboards. I will preface this with 1) governance problems are not only in the government 2) I donxe2x80x99t believe that optimizing metrics is the end-goal, but rather a good barometer for whatxe2x80x99s missing 3) not everything that can be quantified should be quantified. 4) My knowledge of government systems is North American-centric.  To my knowledge, much of the elected legislative branch relies on public opinion (e.g. election results, polls, social media) as one barometer for performance. There arenxe2x80x99t many other easily viewable performance metrics meant for representatives to indicate how much progress theyxe2x80x99ve made towards their platform. While plans for 90 days in office and general plans exist, overall progress made through sponsored bills or initiatives in even a single week in politics can be difficult to track. We wouldnxe2x80x99t fire employees for underperforming if they were not given clear, mutually understood goals, but we fire legislators (by not electing them) even if they arenxe2x80x99t given clear avenues for regular feedback outside of polls. Though far from perfect, a legislator dashboard where core campaign platforms each have a quarterly quantitative metric (e.g. how many clauses drafted towards a certain goal) may be a place to start. On the other hand, not having clear performance metrics also prevent the public from keeping legislators regularly accountable come election time without editorialized summaries. While report cards exist (thanks to Nik Marda for some of these links: 1, 2, 3, 4), they may not come at the frequency or consistency desired. One other example for increasing citizen input outside of polls is crowdsourced policy (e.g. Stanfordxe2x80x99s Participatory budgeting platform project.) More to come. [1] A note on what I mean by xe2x80x9cworthxe2x80x9d. There are very obvious, big problems (climate change, poverty, lack of healthcare access) that will do much more good for people than they cost. These problems are not included here, although I want them very much handled. I also tried to stay away from problems that are solution-first (e.g. insisting that tech. such as AR is the avant-garde solution to some big problem if we hack long enough on the tech. itself). I am not dismissing work that has no immediate use, nor positive externalities. You need people to come up with the abstract notion of groups and rings so a century later someone else can invent asymmetric cryptography. The intention here is to be specific enough people can start chewing away at problems that have big consequences. [2] This is explicitly not a comment on content moderation on private platforms or decentralized web hosting. Those discussions deserve better treatment than one given here. People better informed than me have spoken at length on this issue (e.g. speakers at Josh Constinexe2x80x99s panel on moderation). In particular, Alex Stamos posted a thread on foundational work in this area. [3] I would love to be proven wrong here, so please feel free to send suggestions to the contrary.

Some things that happened (to and in spite of) me in 2020, in no particular order: My music taste was roasted by an xe2x80x9cAIxe2x80x9d algorithm. As we learned many times this year, AI is the answer to everything and eliminates all problems humans bring to decision-making (not). On the plus side, check out some silver linings and great scientific progress researchers made. Water coolers and learning. Zoom university has also made a clearer distinction between learning from people, and learning from the \"booksxe2x80x9d. I appreciated the real value of college more, which has a lot to do with reproducing an environment where you get ensnared into a good hallway conversation with people outside your inner circle.  Books, with some effort, can help you learn to walk, but only people can help you orient where to walk. In other (equally vague yet obvious) words, I canxe2x80x99t know (through books), if I donxe2x80x99t know what to know (through people). While I used to prefer the former out of flexibility and access, especially in high school, losing a degree of access to the latter in terms of spontaneity and proximity has been tough. College environments put you in epsilon-greedy exploration modes, regardless of whether you want them to.  I still donxe2x80x99t have a great way to fill in my blind spots in the absence of in-person conversations. Slack and Zoom rescued this year, but they can only do so much. Curated online communities can be great and active, but many arenxe2x80x99t. There still isnxe2x80x99t a good replacement for the xe2x80x9cnaturalnessxe2x80x9d of face-to-face work despite the explosion of startups that try to put the \"ixe2x80x9d back in haptic. I am lucky to be able to do work remotely, but given the choice of in-person or remote work, I would choose to work in person in a heartbeat.  Some smug comment about the nature of college and online friendships here that I would know how to make if I were better at texting. I am still in the middle of Infinite Jest. So far it reads like losing the plot in a North American superstate, where the reader zone in and out of unending moments. Years are xe2x80x9csubsidizedxe2x80x9d so that corporations can bid on time (try to imagine an entire year dominated by a single product!) Creating vs. Consuming. Lots of people have written eloquently on the consumption to creation ratio. I donxe2x80x99t have anything interesting to add on why creating is a good mental exercise, even when there isnxe2x80x99t an audience to consume content. One thing I havenxe2x80x99t seen anyone remark on yet is that good viral social media apps make you think you can be a good creator and gain an audience quickly, even when itxe2x80x99s much more likely you will be a consumer. This is especially important when the cost to become a creator is small (consider the difference in energy investment between shooting a 1 minute clip and directing a movie). People are willing to be consumers without creating when the cost of creation is high (either in knowledge or effort needed), but will not when the cost is low, regardless of the content quality. I would imagine that data would show that YouTube has a much smaller creator to consumer ratio than TikTok does (if you find stats on this, ping me)! TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, Medium, and Instagram do this well. Media which do not make their consumers feel like good creators lose momentum to those who do. The most evident example of this is Quibi, which neither had the creator elements of YouTube and TikTok, nor met the creative bar TV or movie streaming services set. While I donxe2x80x99t use enough social media to know for sure, my hunch is that Snapchatxe2x80x99s curated ad spots would work much better than Quibixe2x80x99s xe2x80x9cDaily Essentialsxe2x80x9d (around the same video length), if they had launched at the same time, because of Snapchatxe2x80x99s creative element. More random thoughts on occupying digital space, and the choice of media format. The internet lets people occupy more space than they would in real life quickly, which is why credentialism is less relied on for gaining audiences (and status). This is great for citizen journalism and hobbyist creators, but bad for disinformation and misinformation.[Note: When I say space, I mean attention. While credentials should not be mistaken as a synonym for qualification, there are many circumstances (e.g. medical training) for which credentials provide useful information.] Itxe2x80x99s possible to be unpopular or unknown IRL, but famous online. The reverse is also true. People who find it hard to occupy space in person often use online platforms to do so. Text and other standardised formats make it easier for people to feel like good creators through molding different voices into one format, and letting creators occupy a completely different persona than IRL. Audio text formats such as Clubhouse are closer to interacting with people IRL, and therefore also mimic the way space is occupied IRL. The extreme form of standardisation is anonymisation (both name and voice standardised). Anonymity is the easiest way to occupy space with neither qualifications nor consequences, and lets negativity occupy more space than IRL. This is why the Reddit or Blind version of a particular thread will always be more hate-oriented than the Twitter or Facebook version of the same thread. I wrote this to kick off my New Yearxe2x80x99s resolution. If youxe2x80x99re a human who made it all the way here thank you. Shoot me an email, and I will write you a personalized apology for not making this shorter. If youxe2x80x99re an alien I am writing this to celebrate the full rotation of the planet I live on.

Have a question? Feedback? Shoot a quick note to defaultefriend@gmail.com. I feel like no matter what I do, Ixe2x80x99m never accepted. I always feel like an outsider and I donxe2x80x99t know what Ixe2x80x99m doing wrong.I want to give up and live in the woods. xe2x80x94 The Perpetual OutsiderOutsider,First of all, Ixe2x80x99m sorry for taking so long to answer a question that I suspect is causing you a lot of pain. Ixe2x80x99ll be the first to admit that I have this issue, too. I think a lot of us do.Without knowing you or an example of your situation, itxe2x80x99s hard for me to key in on specifics.Here are a few things Ixe2x80x99ve picked up on my own journey, though:(1)  Sometimes, it is our own fault, and we have to take accountability for that. Itxe2x80x99s possible that your behavior does turn people off, and to achieve the kind of acceptance youxe2x80x99re looking for, you will need to fix it. Maybe you bring up topics (totally well-intentioned!) that make people uncomfortable. Maybe you come off as abrupt when you mean to be honest. Maybe youxe2x80x99re rude, maybe you struggle to read the room, maybe your facial expressions signal things you donxe2x80x99t mean them to. Maybe youxe2x80x99re friends with the wrong people. The annoying part is that it could be anything, and occasionally, something shallow or outside of your control. The conventional wisdom here is usually to ask a trusted friend if they have any insight for you. But you may not have one, you may not have one whoxe2x80x99s picked up on anything, or you may not have one whoxe2x80x99s willing to be honest with you. (And who could blame them? Thatxe2x80x99s a tough conversation to have.) So my advice is to try to build your own intuition. Listen to yourself when you speak. And I mean really listen. Do you feel like you interrupt people? Pay close attention to peoplexe2x80x99s facial expressions: do they look uncomfortable when you talk? After a joke?  If itxe2x80x99s online, whatxe2x80x99s your communication style like? Do you only get online to vent? This is a big one that gets a lot of folks in trouble, again, myself included. From where youxe2x80x99re sitting now, these might sound like impossible tasks. But with a little practice and a little more patience, you should be able to pick up on a few clues. The only thing I will caution you about here is not to be too hard on yourself. Try to do this with an open mind, but without getting in a cycle where youxe2x80x99re cataloguing every little thing you think might set folks off. It can be a hard line to walk, but I think itxe2x80x99s a useful exercise.(2) The second piece of advice I have for you is to interrogate your expectations of other people. This is one part the dreaded xe2x80x9citxe2x80x99s in your head,xe2x80x9d and one part, xe2x80x9cmaybe itxe2x80x99s not in your head and itxe2x80x99s just a framing issue.xe2x80x9d The social landscape can often be confusing because words mean different things in different contexts. For example, people will call you their best friend in good faith, but mean that youxe2x80x99re an acquaintance they enjoy spending time with. There are some people youxe2x80x99ll only hear from when they need to share an intimate secret, but they would never invite you to lunch. The list of confusing, conflicting, and common social cues is infinite. We wonxe2x80x99t always have explanations for why people are the way they are, but we can make educated guesses and build our expectations around them. Whether itxe2x80x99s a group or individual, I recommend asking yourself questions like: What does acceptance look like to me? Am I expecting too much? What do I feel like Ixe2x80x99m being left out of? Why do I feel like Ixe2x80x99m entitled to that level of inclusion?Does any of this mean they donxe2x80x99t like me? What does it mean if they donxe2x80x99t?You may very well find that youxe2x80x99re justified in feeling this way. Or you might find that youxe2x80x99re reading into things too much. Itxe2x80x99s okay if you feel like youxe2x80x99re stumbling in the dark. Itxe2x80x99s okay if you find out you are expecting more from people than might make sense on the surface, and to sit with any negative feelings that come from that. Nobody has to know youxe2x80x99re asking yourself these questions, or what your honest answers are. What matters is youxe2x80x99re figuring out what works for you and how to solve your problem in a way that makes sense to you. (3) Be patient.One thing I never hear in these conversations is, xe2x80x9cBe patient, people just donxe2x80x99t know you.xe2x80x9d Sometimes I assume people donxe2x80x99t like me when the truth is they just donxe2x80x99t know me. If you feel like youxe2x80x99re flitting from group to group, scene to scene, and seeing the same resultsxe2x80xa6 maybe you just havenxe2x80x99t been there for long enough. Settle into one for a bit. Give yourself some breathing room. See what happens. You might be pleasantly surprised.(4) And finally, sometimes these feelings are just a proxy for something bigger. We feel physically anxious, but we struggle to identify why, so we label it as something familiar. Interrogating these feelings and tracking the signals that trigger them as they happen can help us make sense of the situation.Whatever the source, like I said above, allow yourself to be sad, angry, or uncomfortable. Itxe2x80x99s okay. Youxe2x80x99re allowed to be frustrated. I canxe2x80x99t say for sure whatxe2x80x99s causing you to feel this way, but I know it sucks.I hope some (or all) of this resonates. And I hope youxe2x80x99re able to find some happiness.What can I do to feel more confident in myself individually? I feel like I put a lot of stock into creating a partnership with someone, but that person realistically isn't a good fit. How can I feel more sure of the red flags that are present, as opposed to trying to justify them so I am \"in a relationship?\"xe2x80x94 Serial DaterSo, I feel like these are actually three separate questions, rather than ideas that neatly weave together. The first question is about managing your sense of self, and the second question is about managing your relationships. The third question is implicit: how do you protect yourself from letting a relationship define your sense of self?From my POV, feeling confident in yourself individually has nothing to do with getting out there and dating. It does, however, inform what your dating life will look like. The first step to liking yourself is knowing yourself. This is a two-pronged process, and notoriously difficult.  Here are a few ideas to get started, though: Find a rhythm. This doesnxe2x80x99t mean a routine that looks the same each day, but it does mean an understanding of what the ebbs and flows of your life are. Having a handle on what you can control, what you canxe2x80x99t, when things are going to suck, and when theyxe2x80x99ll be a little easier. It goes without saying, these days, achieving a rhythm is remarkably difficult  But there are small things you can do to approximate one: achievable goals, favorite foods, a living space that is your own, that you have control over.Work on a project. I donxe2x80x99t believe that we must constantly be productive to find meaning. Wexe2x80x99re people, not automatons. But being able to be proud of something is life-affirming. It can be finally writing that novel and finishing it, but it can also be something as simple as tending a garden, or cooking a meal for yourself every single day, and building that into a skill.Put stock in something that transcends yourself. This is going to sound a little whacky for a dating question or even what initially reads as a more generic self-help question, but I truly believe that a lack of something beyond oneself is why life feels so empty for so many people now. That doesnxe2x80x99t mean you have to be religious and me offering this advice doesnxe2x80x99t mean that I myself lead some pious life. It isnxe2x80x99t about piety so much as it is about passion. Find something you truly believe, that you can continue believing in. That you can hold onto when things are hard. Yes, that could be God, but it could also be your community. It could be the intersection of both. This isnxe2x80x99t an easy task by any stretch of the imagination, but the worst thing that can happen is that your relationships accidentally take this place. Now, onto the second question.The most important realization I ever had about romance is that relationships might be work, but chemistry isnxe2x80x99t. You might not know in a long term way, but you generally know who you should give a chance. Therexe2x80x99s nothing wrong with you if you end up in a relationship with someone who ends up not being a great match. But giving someone that initial chance is a lot more intuitive than you might think. Making excuses for a person who isnxe2x80x99t a good match is usually a more conscious process than you think, too. What about people you have chemistry with who also have red flags? The uncomfortable truth is sometimes itxe2x80x99s not a bad thing to give people who are a mess a chance. I think itxe2x80x99s less about identifying potential trouble, and more about trying to predict whether or not that trouble is something you have the bandwidth to put up with. Through the right lens, we all have a carousel of baggage.Sometimes people are worth being patient for. How do you feel when you talk to them? Can you be your real self? Do you have fun with them? Do they make you smile without trying? Do you care about what they have to say? Are they there for you when it matters?A lot of relationship building is about finding someone who fills in your blanks, the strengths to your weaknesses. Itxe2x80x99s really easy to let that subsume you and lose yourself. The trick is building a self you don't want to lose, but instead, share. Relationships should be about building something together, not letting the stronger person take over.Do you think that male-female friendships can work when they both acknowledge any mutual attraction (no matter how small) rather than ignore it? I've always liked the open flirtiness and affection that the French have but I'm skeptical if that would work in America.xe2x80x94 Bises/bisous This is a hard one for me. I donxe2x80x99t even have an instinct on it! I just donxe2x80x99t know. I will say that I think the reason it works in Europe is because the flirtiness exists with a boundary. Granted, that boundary isnxe2x80x99t always respected, but itxe2x80x99s basically a performance. In the United States, that flirtation might be a performance, it might not be, and the danger is what happens when two people arenxe2x80x99t on the same page. This is an issue I think we have more generally in the States. Social performances exist, but not everyone knows what is and isnxe2x80x99t a performance. Itxe2x80x99s a recipe for conflict. Ixe2x80x99m going to throw this one back out to the readers. What do yxe2x80x99all think? For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.My first thought about the openness of French flirting culture-- I feel like it wouldn't work in the US in the same way because I feel like American communication styles are extremely literal. This may have to do with the theory of \"high and low context cultures\", a demographically diverse country like the US would be \"low context\", where there's less mutually shared experiences so people have to be more explicit. People have used this theory to explain why Americans tell each other \"I love you\" rather frequently compared to other cultures. (I've never said this to my Chinese parents at all; rather, love is shown through acts of kindness)With my Chinese family, I'm more used to playful teasing/sarcasm towards each other. I've seen this with some Indian and Eastern European friends too. It almost felt like a culture shock to me when I started spending time with some American friends who were overwhelmingly positively affirming of each other all the time. A lot of people later told me they thought I didn't like them because I was sarcastic and not similarly positively affirming. So I imagine the playful flirting wouldn't work because people would take it too literally.No posts","title":"#2: Moving to the woods, feeling confident, and flirting like a European  - Default Wisdom","url":"https://defaultfriend.substack.com/p/2-moving-to-the-woods-feeling-confident"}

Instead of events, Ixe2x80x99ll be trying something newxe2x80x94advice. Each week,  I will answer two or three questions aboutxe2x80xa6 basically anything.  Want your question answered? All you have to do is send a short note to defaultefriend@gmail.com. How do you break up with someone when itxe2x80x99s not a completely awful relationship but you care about them? I donxe2x80x99t even know how to end Zoom calls.xe2x80x94 Breaking up is hard to do Ixe2x80x99ve got to be honest, I hate breaking up with people too. We hear a lot about break ups of necessity (they were mean, they were dirty, whatever)xe2x80x94but not a lot about break ups because things justxe2x80xa6 fizzle. Or arenxe2x80x99t working for reasons that donxe2x80x99t feel like good reasons. Itxe2x80x99s a lot harder to stand your ground in those cases, but ultimatelyxe2x80xa6 you just have to tear the bandaid off. Here are two things I think you need to do: Work through your own feelings first. Nothing is worse than a wishy washy break up. The, xe2x80x9cWell, actually, maybe ifxe2x80xa6xe2x80x9d The person who changes their mind midway through their break up speech. If you want to break up, go into it with a plan to break up. If you have a problem with your partner that you think is fixable, go into the conversation with a plan to find a resolution and the strength to walk away if you canxe2x80x99t. Mixed signals make people mad because it gives them hope. And people can stay hopeful for a long, long time. A period of no contact is really important, but be emotionally prepared for them to not to want to stay friends. If you love someonexe2x80x94if you even just like someone, or have some kind of attachment to themxe2x80x94it can be hard to see them in a different role. Sometimes you just canxe2x80x99t, no matter how far away you move from the situation. One piece of advice Ixe2x80x99ve never forgotten: just because somethingxe2x80x99s been historically good, doesnxe2x80x99t mean it can or should last forever.Howdy,I'm <30 in tech, and I am having a quarter-life crisis. My job involves leading a team of ~30 people in a project that aligns perfectly with my interests, passions, and politics. It's everything I could ever want from a job, but it may severely limit my future prospects. I am a TVC, which immediately brings to mind all the people answering calls for when your Google Home accidentally shows your kids rap for the first time. While this is a very technical project that often takes orders from a massively-important VP of the company we're a vendor of, I worry that staying will mean I am forever locked out of the upper echelon of companies.Do I quit before it's too late, or do I stay to lead a growing team I put together myself? I don't want to be stuck in the suckerfish economy when I'm 40.Thanks,Underappreciated in AustinHey Under Appreciated in Austin,Soxe2x80x94for those of you reading who donxe2x80x99t know what a xe2x80x9cTVCxe2x80x9d is, itxe2x80x99s xe2x80x9ctemporary, vendor, or contractor.xe2x80x9d Working as a contractor in tech is a funny thing, that I think gets different reactions depending on who youxe2x80x99re speaking to. Here are a few that come to mind: Most saliently, when applying for a job, I think it depends on how you spin it. My instinct is if that if you have the right references and list your accomplishments, youxe2x80x99ll be okay. Check to see what your contracting agencyxe2x80x99s reputation is using websites like Quora, Glassdoor or TeamBlind. They wonxe2x80x99t give you a perfect answer, but youxe2x80x99ll be able to suss it out with a little bit of legwork. If youxe2x80x99re self-incorporated, therexe2x80x99s no shame in saying xe2x80x9cself-employedxe2x80x9d and then listing the vendor as your client.Socially, people either get it or they donxe2x80x99t. Sometimes, itxe2x80x99s easy to use shorthand and say you just work for the vendor, if theyxe2x80x99re your only client. Other times, people may assume your job is somehow fake or less important, because they donxe2x80x99t understand how the process works. It may even be the same when applying to some jobs, but my guess is those arenxe2x80x99t jobs you need or want anyway. There are, of course, always going to be people who judge you for not being a full-time employee, professionally and socially, but itxe2x80x99s mostly an ignorance thing.  If youxe2x80x99re authentically doing high level work, I donxe2x80x99t think itxe2x80x99s going to negatively impact your future. Donxe2x80x99t jump ship if youxe2x80x99re doing what you really want to do. I would especially caution you to be deliberate about career moves in this particular moment in history, too, given the way the economyxe2x80x99s been behaving lately. Letxe2x80x99s put things into perspective: youxe2x80x99re lucky to be employed right now! Anyone who has work isxe2x80x94even in tech.When the world calms down if your role as a contractor is causing you to view yourself negatively, however, leverage the good stuff youxe2x80x99ve been doing and either try to get converted or find a full time position at a smaller company. I know from a close friend (who inspired most of this answer!) that if youxe2x80x99re at Google, itxe2x80x99s not uncommon for high performing vendors and contractors to be converted when itxe2x80x99s a role thatxe2x80x99s not always a contract position.

The project was simple: become the person people call when no one else picks up. A lot of folks ask me how I had the patience and energy for this. How could I have unlimited bandwidth for strangers?

Other apps may provide similar informationxe2x80x94real time or at least estimated crowdedness of a placexe2x80x94but Google does it best. Similar might be traffic density maps. But how often are these categories information from a local provider? Thinking of local providers, GTFS comes to mind, the format that public transit providers adhere to which helps your Google Maps app estimate travel time by train or bus.  This is a key part of many mapping applications, where you really donxe2x80x99t want to switch over to the SNCF app if youxe2x80x99re in France or the RTA app if youxe2x80x99re in Denver, but might rather just calculate in Google Maps how to get from home to the mountains, with a time estimate and transit schedule. When it comes time to buy a ticket, you do have to often go back to the local app. In Denver Ixe2x80x99d buy a ticket on the RTA app to get from the airport to downtown, while in Salt Lake City I used the local parking app to pay for my parking while strolling the city. The local app often still rules, though Google is changing this, too. Centralization at its best, all for the convenience of the user.Last month, however, India announced a collaboration between MapMyIndia and the Indian space program. xe2x80x9cMapmyIndia CEO Rohan Verma specifically named Google Maps and Google Earth as the products he hopes the new solution would replace\",xe2x80x9d reads the linked article. Verma specifically points out:xe2x80x9cxe2x80xa6foreign search engines and companies claim to offer xe2x80x98freexe2x80x99 maps, but in reality they make money by targeting the same users with advertising based on invading user privacy and auctioning those usersxe2x80x99 private location and movement data. This should be very alarming to all citizensxe2x80x9d.And so a new local app is born, which if not by organic popularity, then by government decree will become the best mobile map app in Indiaxe2x80x94and also the best conduit for gathering data such as density of people at a given time, popularity of specific POIs, and search rankings. This brings a lot of value to a government, for better or worse.Singapore already has such a app, called OneMap, which claims to be xe2x80x9cauthoritative national map of Singapore with the most detailed and timely updated informationxe2x80x9d, with local government agencies contributing data, and all in spite of major ma companies like Google and Grab having offices and a market to serve in Singapore. Meanwhile, in Kuwait, the Kuwait Finder app provides a similar service. In South Korea you may try NAVER Map, Baidu when in China, while in Russia maybe Yandex. There are various others, and it may be arguable that in countries less connected and globalizedxe2x80x94think perhaps Uzbekistan, Bolivia, Bhutan, or Armeniaxe2x80x94map data may be very difficult for a distant global company to obtain and digest.This is why OpenStreetMap is of monumental value to any company with ambitions of a global map: it sources local data from local people. However, OpenStreetMap volunteers this data, while you probably donxe2x80x99t remember volunteering to Google your presence at the Italian restaurant, or the fact that youxe2x80x99re stuck in a traffic jam. These extra features, aside from just a basemap, are what really help drive engagement. Google can get these data in Armenia, even if none of the addresses are working well and the basemap is outdated. Googlexe2x80x99s efforts to activate local guides and crowdsource map errors have gone a long way, but OpenStreetMap still has soul in places where Google just has error logs and tourists making reviews. It may be something of a cold war that the users of each donxe2x80x99t really feel they participate in. With initiativexe2x80x99s like Indiaxe2x80x99s new national map app, it is certain that Google is being pushed out, but will OpenStreetMap be leveraged to build these national maps?Without OpenStreetMap, building national maps to displace Google Maps means a lot of proprietary data, even if converted to open data, and a lot of effort from GIS departments, land surveyors, and other groups collecting data who probably are not passionate volunteers. Singaporexe2x80x99s OneMap is an example, but in a small country with a good budget, and perhaps motivation to also have official ownership of the data Google would otherwise be extracting, itxe2x80x99s certainly possible to achieve. On national scales, would small governments like Switzerland or Colombia or New Zealand be interested in assembling all the geospatial data they collect, filling in the gaps with new data, designing an engaging user experience, then launching and maintaining a mobile app? What is the benefit to them? What is the cost? All are very debatable.What is probably unlikely is a mass decentralization of the mobile map app. Itxe2x80x99s not just difficult for startups and even alliances of large private companies to compete with the Google Maps mobile appxe2x80x99s hegemony, but even governments with their ability to promote an app still lack many of the resources and even imagination to be competitive in this space. What may be likely is that specific governments will succeed because of a few factors: first, lack of great map data locally that only a well distributed government service can collect and update efficiently; second, a motivation to get access to the user data that Google has proven such mobile map apps can extract; and third, conflict between Google and the national or local government, whether because the government is protective of citizen privacy, or hostile to globalized influences. Overall, it may be questionable to see government map apps compete with Google Maps, because the same privacy issues may arise, but nonetheless if it is achieved, it could begin to chip away at Googlexe2x80x99s geospatial supremacy on the global scale, receding Google out of many countries, including markets of billions such as China and India but also millions from Nigeria to Iran to Brazil, if the government so desires.  Whether OpenStreetMap is the friend to any enemy of Google remains to be seen, but in a possible decentralized future we may be saying: xe2x80x9cWhen in Rome, use the mobile map app that the Romans use.xe2x80x9dNo posts","title":"Will the mobile map application decentralize? - Bedogged","url":"https://bedogged.substack.com/p/will-the-mobile-map-application-decentralize"}

To put it in a few phrases: Google Maps is the best mobile application for maps that exists by any measure; many of us who are avid contributors to OpenStreetMap (and probably those who personally contribute to and professional build HERE Mapsxe2x80x99 HereWeGo, or Apple Maps, and others) are regular users of Google Maps by default; the reason Google Maps is the best is not because of the map data quality but simply because of widespread adoption; OpenStreetMap does not compete with this via any existing mobile app in any real way such as having a real share of the mobile map user market (whether the community wants to compete or just small companies want to compete using OSM data). This entire bout of thinking was brought on by my own behavior, where I regularly make a mental note of the menacing guilt that comes along each time I open Google Maps on my mobile phone for any simple need. This is despite that fact that my current residence is located at the end of about 330 meters of unpaved road and driveway that has no existence on Google Maps. Navigation directs me to a plot in the middle of US Highway 93 then gives a dashed arc indicating I need to kindly hop through the woods onto the property. OpenStreetMap becomes better data simply because I can fix that (it already exists as a road but needs extra cleanup), and because I can add all the places I regularly navigate to, as well as new ones as I come across them. But the data is not the problem. The problem is that every mobile app available is just not as a good from a product perspective. The interface, the aesthetic, the functionality, the general experience, are always inferior. This is not a critique of OSM itself, but of the mediums through which it reaches mobile users. It is also an extremely difficult feat to make a great OSM-based app for general use (as opposed to very specific uses like hiking) because there is such a clear market leader in Google Maps. As I claimed in part one, however, there was a decent contender: Maps.me. It had its drawbacks, but those aside, it also seems to have lost its momentum. I donxe2x80x99t know what really happened with any certainty, but in this post Ixe2x80x99ll try and recount rumors, whispers, legends, and probably some misinterpretations or even complete myths, all in effort to explore why Maps.me may never be the contender we need.The Tale of Maps.meSome light background: Maps.me was initially released in 2011. It was founded by Yury Melnichek (xd0xaexd1x80xd1x8bxd0xb9 xd0x9cxd0xb5xd0xbbxd1x8cxd0xbdxd1x96xd1x87xd0xb0xd0xba) of Belarus, perhaps with co-founders who were also Belarusian, from what I can tell. It was registered as a company in Switzerland, however. The initial project was a mobile app with OpenStreetMap data as a basemap, which allowed some submission of edits to OSM. It required the user to download data for any local area, for example zooming into my town required downloading all of the state of Montana, while in other places with denser data I may be prompted to download just an entire city. This data then also worked offline, including allowing offline search and routing. One of my favorite people in the OSM community also worked there, Ilya Zverev, who I didnxe2x80x99t ask for details on this because I want to write this as a total outsider who is not in the know.Recent chatter across Telegram groups, Twitter threads, and newsletters gave me bits and pieces of a dramatic tale: the rise and fall of Maps.me. I havenxe2x80x99t looked at the app in weeks, having been rather sedentary toward the end of 2020, but it was clear to me something changed. A few months ago, I saw that Maps.me had been purchased by a company I didnxe2x80x99t recognize. Some quick searching showed me it was certainly confusing: it seems the Russian Mail.Ru had previously purchased the app, which I didnxe2x80x99t realize, and sold it to a Swiss-registered company that seemed to have a Korean name, that may be also Russian owned. I am not sure any of that means anything, except to me, as a sometimes avid OSM community member, it means that I have no idea who owns this app and what they want to achieve with it. And I suspect they arenxe2x80x99t very intent on filling the gap I mentioned above: the need for an OpenStreetMap-based mobile app that has potential to be truly relevant in daily life of all people who use Google Maps now but donxe2x80x99t need to be trapped on Google. I say itxe2x80x99s a need because I think itxe2x80x99s too fragile for a supermajority of the worldxe2x80x99s mobile map app users to be dependent on a single source of geographic truth that responds variably at best to community contributions.I started digging deeper, and here I will summarize the story of what happened, though I canxe2x80x99t claim itxe2x80x99s the whole truth or completely accuratexe2x80x94just a compilation of rumors and tales. It Starts on TwitterTwitter is a great place to find out whatxe2x80x99s happening before any formal publication picks it up, and I found a Tweet that was blatantly, concisely critical of Maps.mexe2x80x99s 2.0 update, which I also didnxe2x80x99t know had emerged. The official response was well stated, as I do know what itxe2x80x99s like to work on a map product and get hate mail, then still want to respond and try to solicit actionable feedback. Always a nice touch to offer an Amazon voucher for feedback, tooxe2x80x94Ixe2x80x99ve read product and user research material that recommends this as a goodwill token for usersxe2x80x99 time. But more intriguing is the phrase xe2x80x9cmassively enhanced experiencexe2x80x9d, alongside, xe2x80x9cthat old versionxe2x80x9d, yesxe2x80xa6 that old thing. The new owners have plans, it seems.That same day, I saw some chatter on Telegram continuing about Maps.me, but it was like joining a conversation halfway throughxe2x80x94despite all being written there in front of me, I was missing some context. A link to a new channel was made, inviting anyone who was interested in following the developments of Maps.me called xe2x80x9cMaps.me Original Project Updatesxe2x80x9d. In this channel, an article was posted which really summarized what Ixe2x80x99m trying to summarize here. So Ixe2x80x99ll soon get to the completely short version adapted from that author, Ondxc5x99ej Sojka. But first, more backstory.Acquisition after acquisitionAfter being bought by Mail.Ru in 2014, as far as I can tell, a major change in Maps.me is that further monetization was sought, through what Wikipedia describes as xe2x80x9cunobtrusive ads.xe2x80x9d A press release from Mail.Ru tells more, citing a change that Maps.me Pro was now available for free (apparently is was $4.99 previously). xe2x80x9cUnlike Google Maps, whose offline maps provide at best a limited level of detail, MAPS.ME's offline functionality is fast, seamless, and comprehensive,xe2x80x9d said the press release. Interesting statement, claiming that the xe2x80x9climited level of detailxe2x80x9d of Google Maps is not countered by high detail of OSM, but instead by the Maps.me product itself and offline functionality. The press release from 2014 also claims over 7 million install of Maps.me since inception, and quotes the CEO of Mail.Ru: xe2x80x9cWe think that making the MAPS.ME application free and available to everyone will be a critical step towards the development of a global, universally accurate mapping system.xe2x80x9d Free like Google Maps, but funded how?The release then elaborates that the acquisition was intended to bolster a xe2x80x9ccommunitainmentxe2x80x9d campaign of communications plus entertainment, consisting of Mail.Ruxe2x80x99s leading web mail and browser products, plus something called My.com with a vision xe2x80x9cto build an integrated communication and entertainment platform xe2x80xa6 beginning with a family of mobile apps and games, and most recently, expanding to PC games bringing immersive, massively multiplayer online experiences to the massesxe2x80x9d. Their website, which still showcases the Maps.me logo, is not terribly compelling. Another article mentioned that Maps.me would become open source as a result of the acquisition by Mail.Ru.Daegu Limited bought Maps.me in late 2020 for about $20 million USD, though the quoted price was originally in rubles. A press release claims that the app had 140 million installs and 10 million monthly active users at this time. The release also makes some more interesting statements: Daegu is part of the Parity.com group; Mail.Ru sold in order to focus on other core things, which international travel is not included within (it was 2020 after all); the Mail.Ru Group-Sberbank joint plaform includes delivery and rideshare services like Russian Citymobil who appear to have map interests as well; Parity Group is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. Another article says xe2x80x9cParity.com Group is an instant global settlement system which helps individuals and corporates around the world store money in AAA safety and transfer it in real-time.xe2x80x9d Maps.me is gone?This is where Sojkaxe2x80x99s article comes back to relevance. Sojka describes Daegu Limited as a South Korean payments company (which isnxe2x80x99t clear, it appears it is registered in Cyprus). He clearly states his personal mission to bring it back, which appears to be centered on taking action on the open source repository. That might be related to this fork.But why such a reaction, considering Maps.me has been sold before? Why italicize payments company? Sojka titles one section of his article xe2x80x9cThey made another Google Maps.xe2x80x9d He also says that many details have been removed from the basemap itself, and that the ability to contribute back to OSM has disappeared into thin air. Finally, he points out the new xe2x80x9cwallets tabxe2x80x9d and states: xe2x80x9cClearly, a map that highlights businesses makes more money than a map that is useful.xe2x80x9dThere are many important directions we can go with this information. In fact, in part three of this series wexe2x80x99ll look into much of this: whether being like Google Maps is bad and why yes/no; what makes a map useful; why highlighting businesses is good/bad; why monetization can make as well as break an app. But in this case, Sojkaxe2x80x99s premise is that these features are negative developments.The question is where the plan from the current Maps.me team (or at least their social media manager) will really take this app. My critique is that it failed to compete with Google Maps as a product, despite the press release numbers showing 133 million new installs since the 7 million in 2014, pretty fantastic growth. But Sojkaxe2x80x99s critique is that the app has become a Google Maps in that it offers map services but only as a way to get users to spend money. I still contend that Maps.me is not and will not be as good as Google Maps in the sense of a mobile app interface, and we all know the data qualityxe2x80x94POIs, routing, search, and so onxe2x80x94is another discussion if comparing to Google Maps, hard to sum up in a sentence.Testimonials and anecdotesThe Hacker News comments on Sojkaxe2x80x99s article also have some good gems explaining whatxe2x80x99s at stake, and what happened in the past. A succinct testimonial here:xe2x80xa6it was fast, simple, offline and had no tracking. Mail.ru then decided for a different revenue stream, killed the pay option and added things I don't want, like booking.com ads and travel guides and other thingsxe2x80xa6And a more lengthy one here:Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don't get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn't somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you've created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don't have internet and need the map on my phone. I know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant.Some dashed hopes:I havenxe2x80x99t used maps.me much, but generally itxe2x80x99s been a good experience. Other than being told multiple times to make a right turn to keep going straight on a highway, itxe2x80x99s been nice having directions and search that is entirely client-side and blazing fast.Using it has made me want to contribute to OSM to improve the quality. To hear that itxe2x80x99s changing owners and becoming more of a product is unfortunate.Google Translate and meGoogle Translate has been key to this investigation of mine, particularly because I canxe2x80x99t do much more than read subway station names in Cyrillic script. Translation as a whole is very key to the OpenStreetMap community, and often done with open source tools, or by the valiant humans of our community who translate things like editors, plugins, and the weekly newsletter. Thanks to that newsletter, I happen to believe there is always fascinating material coming out of the OSM communities who speak Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian, and I often Google Translate blog posts and articles from Shtosm and Habr, among other sources. So now I use Google Translate in addition to GMail, Google Maps, and Google Fi, and more. My guilt is cataclysmic.And so my final bit of gossip makes its debut: a great analysis and reflection by Ilya Zvervev, who I mentioned earlier that I did not speak with directly about this whole debacle. Ilya wrote an article titled xe2x80x9cDeath of MAPS.ME?xe2x80x9d with a nice tombstone image on the headline which Ixe2x80x99ve borrowed for emphasis.Ilyaxe2x80x99s summary is very valuable: he knows Maps.me better than most, as a user and a former insider/developer. He starts off by describing what has actually changed without much judgment. First, Ilya states that Maps.me is no longer offline maps, but instead is all online, tiles loaded on demand, with some offline capabilities xe2x80x9cyes, exactly the same as in Google Maps.xe2x80x9d The app now uses the Mapbox SDK which initially made things slower, though a fix seems to have been deployed. Fundamentally, this means what was a lightweight, fast-loading application usable anywhere regardless of stable internet access is now much bulkier. As Ilya sums it up, xe2x80x9cxe2x80xa6the new owners threw out the main, in my opinion, functionality in the application.xe2x80x9dIlya also describes several other steps backward. First, the place/address search seems to perform more poorly. In addition, the pedestrian paths donxe2x80x99t appear visible like they were before. Ilya says these paths were a key feature for him:.Pedestrian navigation was one of the key features of the application for me, how many paths we took when traveling, and neither Apple Maps nor Google Maps knew about these paths.Ilya also adds that xe2x80x9cthe UI has become monstrous, and in general it strongly resembles Google Maps.xe2x80x9d I am not certain if this means that the Google Maps UI itself is monstrous, or if what may be a beautiful Google Maps UI is manifested here in an ugly way. Aside from the above, Ilya lists 12 other downgrades and disappearances including lack of public transit navigation, poor offline performance, and lack of OSM editing.Finally, Ilya gives four options of what to do if you were a passionate Maps.me user in the past. In summary: do not upgrade; switch to the yet to be refined open source version; wait for a proper fork (for iOS particularly); use alternative OSM-based apps like OsmAnd.Surveying the crowdOf course this review of Ilya Zverevxe2x80x99s article is not complete without a look at the comments as well, and thus Google Translate comes in handy once more. I sifted through some of the 399 comments as of today. Many commenters cited their impending move to a new app like OsmAnd, Locus Maps, Mapy.cz, or Guru Maps. Another points out that Mail.Ruxe2x80x99s projects in food delivery use Google Maps, and hence Maps.me wasnxe2x80x99t achieving anything new under their ownership. One commenter, presumably a developer in the pre-Daegu days of Maps.me, implies no part in the recent product decisions and says about the change in direction: xe2x80x9cIt came as a surprise to us.xe2x80x9dAnother commenter talks about the need for revenue in the design choices:xe2x80xa6 [it is] about increasing the visibility of shops and cafes. And it's hard to make money on footpaths and railway lines. It is also difficult to make money offlinexe2x80xa6One commenter implies that the need that Maps.me fulfilled is a thing of the past (it would be worthwhile to see where in the world these 140 million installs are, in case they donxe2x80x99t have world city level wifi/LTE/5G).xe2x80xa6it seems that offline maps were relevant in the days of slow and expensive mobile Internet. I myself used them then 7-5 years ago. That is, for me they were travel maps. And in recent years, I don't understand why this is necessary at all, when there are tariffs with free unlimited data roamingxe2x80xa6And of course, the ultimate edge case:For example, I used an offline mod in North Korea. Do you have any ingenious suggestions how I could use online maps there? :)  Overall, while the nuances of the future of Maps.me are not clear, it seems the high level strategy is obvious. What is now gone is the past, lightweight version with a detail true to OSMxe2x80x99s rich database. What will be here to stay is the monetization via highlighting businesses, removing niche features for easier maintenance, and steering user behavior toward what can be profitable.Goodbye, Maps.meWe may be able to close the books on Maps.me for the time being. It is clear that the strategy for the app has shifted as ownership changed. It seems that instead of an obscure payments company registered in Cyprus trying to create its own mobile app with a maps, POI lookup, and navigation focus, this company decided to cannibalize an already existing app, maybe with the idea that it could retain some of the active users (remember, 10 million monthly active users claimed). If 90% of those users leave, it may still be a success and worth the roughly $20 million purchase. I would love to see the analytics for Maps.me showing the location of IP addresses pinging the app, or information about the users who downloaded it. I am most curious to know the global distribution of users, as I am not sure what part of the world Daegu/Parity is hoping to target with its payment services, what demographics, or how seriously it wants to compete with Google Maps rather than something like Chinaxe2x80x99s WeChat payments or something like the US-based Cash App or Stripe.This is a novel thing in the OpenStreetMap world however: maps as an essential part of an app that encourages users to adopt is wallet and money transfer features. Imagine a payments app like Transferwise purchasing OsmAnd or Magic Earth. Is that was is happening? Google and Maps.me (via Mail.Ru) both were inserting links to sites like Booking.com in their maps, when hotels were searched. While Google Maps more broadly seeks monetization through advertising various businesses, is Daegu/Parity looking to also monetize through transaction fees? Are other companies looking to use maps as a basis for other monetization methods, like inserting a peer to peer buying/selling platform (Craigslist and such) into a map app? What other profitable services could be built on top of the map that we may use to otherwise navigate highways, find a park, or check the distance on a hiking trail?Wexe2x80x99ll explore more about the possible ways to monetize a map-based mobile app in part 3. Overall, I think itxe2x80x99s safe to say that once again, Google Maps remains at the top of the food chain, and Maps.me is rapidly relinquishing itxe2x80x99s former position as the top OSM-based competitor to Google Maps.No posts","title":"The Mobile Map App Part II: Pivoting and Flopping - Bedogged","url":"https://bedogged.substack.com/p/the-mobile-map-app-part-ii-pivoting"}

I was a bit younger, staying in a hostel on the island of Tenerife, joining in the evening gossip around the kitchen with fellow rock climbers. Two of them agreed that Maps.me was much better than Google Maps for navigating the roads on Tenerife, and even better for finding trails and points of interest (POIs) for iconic climbing areas. I wasnxe2x80x99t terrible interested, suspecting it was just another ultra-specialized app like some for trails or skiing I had seen, but then I took a look and immediately realized it was based on OpenStreetMap. Soon after, I attended a State of the Map conference as a newcomer, met respectable engineers behind Maps.me, and realized it was a viable alternative to Google Maps, with a somewhat underground, European-centered, and hobbyist feeling userbase. I somewhat dismissed its global importance even if fully embracing it as a personal tool. None of my friends back home in Montana (USA) knew of Maps.me, but as I traveled about I realized it was popular outside the USA for its possession of more local knowledge than that sourced by Google, despite all their efforts. Later I would explain to people that I actually helped build the map they used on Maps.me when I was explaining what OpenStreetMap is (instead of xe2x80x9cthe Wikipedia of mapsxe2x80x9d). However, I couldnxe2x80x99t directly demonstrate that I helped build it, because when I added a new road or business I realized it took two weeks or so to populate, and hence the editing wasnxe2x80x99t all that interesting to many people nor useful to me in the immediate term. A growing affinityI kept using Maps.me. Its very simple interface was something like a xe2x80x9cCraigslist of mapsxe2x80x9d, and the offline capabilities by defaultxe2x80x94no map was accessible without downloading the regionxe2x80x94made it ideal for hikes where I was out of mobile signal, or travels where Ixe2x80x99d be switching SIM cards and running out of data (before I switched to Google Fi, which foreshadows something perhaps). As I spent more and more of my personal time editing OpenStreetMap, but also found my professional life converging on it as well, I wondered: where does the rest of the world ever see my work? I still ask this question often to other mappers. We know there are various mobile apps that use OpenStreetMap: OsmAnd, Gaia GPS, Komoot, Magic Earth. There are others that donxe2x80x99t have the same category of functions, but what is unique about this group is that in most ways they mimic Google Maps: search, navigation, bookmarking places, and maybe even reviews. Maps.me seemed to be the reigning queen of the mobile map apps, in the underground space at least. Outside of OSM, HERE Technologies has HereWeGo, which I tested once for navigation and didnxe2x80x99t enjoy, and whose map editor Ixe2x80x99ve used and rather more enjoyed. Apple Maps and Bing Maps were their own thing sometime, not OSM based in deep history, as far as I am aware. The first iteration of Apple Maps was ugly enough, supposedly, to be mocked in the Silicon Valley TV show on HBO. After Gavin the Hooli magnate asks if a new product is Windows Vista bad, even Zune bad, his advisor responds: xe2x80x9cIxe2x80x99m sorry Gavin. Itxe2x80x99s Apple Maps bad.xe2x80x9d And then Apple Maps turned to OSM data for their mobile app.And why, oh why, does OSM even matter?My OSM use in public can be somewhat conspicuous, as I stop to mark something on the mobile phone, or walk around with a 360 camera on a stick, or pick up a rental car and immediately attach multiple cameras to it with magnets. People around me continued to casually inquire about the meaning behind all the effort I spent contributing to OSM, much less the effort from various companies doing exciting machine learning work. Why did it matter? What map is this? Where can we see it? Itxe2x80x99s a bit easier to explain such an impact if you contribute to something like Linux, which you can explain has an important role deep under the surface of so many of our devices and systems, something that affects perhaps almost everyone on earth who is connected to the internet. But OpenStreetMap always left me asking: xe2x80x9cWell, do you use Maps.me? Because its the data on that.xe2x80x9d And sometimes Ixe2x80x99d insert Apple Maps, or OsmAnd. But these are not very popular apps in the lives of most people I speak with, while also seem to be restricted to iOS and Android respectively. People are using Strava (Google Maps), Uber (Google Maps on the front end), or the beast Google Maps itself. There are mobile editors for OSM like Vespucci and GoMap!! and StreetComplete and Observe which are all commendable but are for an extreme niche of users who specifically contribute to the map.Ixe2x80x99m often at a loss of words. But then came Facebook and Instagramxe2x80x99s whole adoption of OSM. I first used the Instagram API years ago as a graduate student to predict the popularity of trails in the mountains outside Seattle based on image density and tags, and it was very revealing. Now that API is closed and shut. But in the Instagram app today we get glimpses of a map. In Facebook as well, most notable in my personal use under the Marketplace, where I hunt for used Nordic skis or a coffee table from time to time. There is no independent app with navigation and the opportunity to search, pan, and zoom freely, but OSM is there. And I can tell people that theyxe2x80x99ve seen this map that us OSM contributors produce when they use Facebook apps. Many people find that acceptable, acknowledging our painstaking map editing is relevant. But really, so many of us still go on to pull up Google Maps later that day when searching for the nearest sewing shop, or directions to the lake, or calculating the distance from Phoenix to Salt Lake City. Google Maps RulesWhile I can rank something like Maps.me or OsmAnd as top OSM-based apps, it is Google Maps that truly sits on the throne. And this is not to speak about the quality of the data, how quickly it updates, the superiority of its street view in a ratio of quality to coverage. Google is slowly slipping on all these things. But the usership of Google Maps seems ubiquitous. I have no stats on Google Mapsxe2x80x99 usership compared to OSM-based apps, and a quick search (on DuckDuckGo, which now uses Apple MapKit JS and some OSM) revealed little statistical material of use with light digging. I could look up total reviews and downloads on the app stores, but I know itxe2x80x99ll confirm what Ixe2x80x99m positing: so many of us use Google Maps for daily activity, even those of us who contribute to OSM significantly, or know enough about maps to otherwise benefit from other apps.In general, OpenStreetMap simply lacks a strong and competitive mobile map application that offers a complete alternative to Google Maps. Many of the contenders for queen are good, but they havenxe2x80x99t come close to deposing the queen. OsmAnd has taken first steps, but in my case remains difficult to use by default because it just doesnxe2x80x99t agree with my instincts, which Google Maps probably subconsciously formed in me. Gaia GPS is my favorite for hiking, hands-down, and I happily pay for an annual subscription to it. Magic Earth looks beautiful in terms of UI. Therexe2x80x99s another, OnX, which I think OSM needs to learn from but I will save that for another day. Ands Maps.me has been really nice, but has taken a turn, maybe for the worse. More on that in Part 2 of this post.Where are we today?I worry myself every time I open Google Maps on my phone. I feel like a traitor. I write here about how itxe2x80x99s the pinnacle of mobile map apps, but only because we all use it, a self-reinforcing loop. While I spend multiple hours per week editing OSM lately, out of pure personal interest, I turn around and use Google Maps to navigate, or to find a review, or even look at a satellite image of a bicycle path. Itxe2x80x99s simply too easy to do, and a difficult habit to break. I also use Google Fi for my mobile service, which has been stellar in years past for giving me continuous service despite frequent travel across international borders, and living part time in a handful of countries. Itxe2x80x99s also too easy to use, and things like Google Meet (Hangouts) and Gmail also have similar effects on us, even if we know itxe2x80x99s not what we should be using (Ixe2x80x99m always close to a wholesale move to Jitsi or ProtonMail, but never close enough).While Google Fi wins me over because Ixe2x80x99m a niche mobile phone user willing to pay slightly more for convenience of never switching SIM cards, Google Maps wins me over for the opposite reason: I often use maps the same way that everyone around me does, whether I am in the USA or Hungary or somewhere in between. Google Maps is made for the everyday personxe2x80x99s needs, not as a map, but as an app.We are starting 2021 with an OpenStreetMap that is perhaps more widespread than ever. It is commonly hailed as critical infrastructure across apps used by major companies, and my belief is that this is more true on the back-end than on the front-end where consumers and citizens see the map. It may be that OpenStreetMap faces a visibility problemxe2x80x94both in people being aware that it exists, as well as aware that itxe2x80x99s an ingredient in their apps. What is certain, however, is that it fails to competexe2x80x94not as a map or a database, but as a product. The data quality is always improving, the local knowledge is stellar but varies, the editing tools are ever-improving, the community is growing in size as well as across countries and demographics. But the product of OpenStreetMap is poorly marketed, lacks developed user interfaces and experience, and remains in many ways a raw materialxe2x80x94a database as we sayxe2x80x94waiting to be refined. Some have tried to do this broadly (OsmAnd), some have found and lost momentum (Maps.me), and others have either used only pieces of OSM (Apple Maps) or focused on a niche (Gaia GPS) that doesnxe2x80x99t categorically compare to Google Maps. Ask yourself today how many of your friends and family are fully familiar with an OpenStreetMap-based product versus Google Maps. Ask yourself how many strangers on the street are unknowingly using the map that you contribute to, rather than probably not using it at all. In the end, many of us as contributors to OSMxe2x80x94its data, software, community building, education, all aspectsxe2x80x94are somewhat like artists whose work has not been displayed and forever sits dormant in a storage room, discussed at insider conferences, pubs, and coffee houses, but like the case of many famous artists may never be known until we are long gone. Can an OSM-based mobile app change this and make OSM a truly every-day standalone service across devices, throughout all cultures, around the globe? To be determined.No posts","title":"The Mobile Map App Part I: The Void - Bedogged","url":"https://bedogged.substack.com/p/the-mobile-map-app-part-i-the-void"}

Some will argue that the author veers towards protesting a bit too much that the xe2x80x9cMongols were good actually!xe2x80x9d, but his prose is engaging and his genuine empathy for the subject is refreshing if you allow for the boosterism. If youxe2x80x99re going to have a tour guide, one with genuine enthusiasm for the subject is not the worst choice.Weatherford followed up Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World with The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire and Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom. These two books make the case for a realm of home-front matriarchs and religious pluralism, Mongol-style. If you enjoy Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World Ixe2x80x99d say the follow-ups donxe2x80x99t disappoint. Just be forewarned that these treatments come with a bit of teleology, with the Mongols selectively drawn in a light most congenial to the Western liberal-democratic ethos.Give a gift subscriptionShareThey donxe2x80x99t make them like The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia anymore. Originally written in 1939 in French by Renxc3xa9 Grousset, The Empire of the Steppes is 600+ pages of diplomatic, military and political history which unfolds the whole known narrative of Central Asia in exquisite detail. Though somewhat lacking in economic or cultural dimensions, Groussetxe2x80x99s book delivers you an excellent scaffold for approaching steppe history with an explicit sequence in time as a framework. What the volume lacks in prose style, it makes up for in pure density of fact and comprehensiveness of scope.Though the English translation is out of print, I highly recommend tracking it down used, not least because unfortunately, general histories of this sort are not currently in vogue in academia.Give a gift subscriptionShareMuch of the human impact of the steppe on the rest of Eurasia dates to the period before history. About half the worldxe2x80x99s population today speaks Indo-European languages, a phenomenon with roots that goes back 5,000 years ago, to the Neolithic. David W. Anthonyxe2x80x99s The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World is the best long-form treatment of this topic. He succeeds in keeping it accessible to laypeople while maintaining academic rigor.Anthony is an archaeologist by training, but he synthesizes historical linguistics and genetics into a compelling narrative of the rise and expansion of ancestral Indo-Europeans out of the grasslands of southern Russia. Since the writing of this book in 2008, paleogenetic research on the people here profiled most extensively, the Yamnaya pastoralists, has revealed they were far more demographically significant than even Anthony had dared suspect. So this book is that rare volume that has only grown more relevant and important over the decade and change since it came out.Give a gift subscriptionShareMuch as Groussetxe2x80x99s The Empire of the Steppes was a classic of the 1939 vintage, Christopher I. Beckwithxe2x80x99s  Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present is written for 21st-century tastes. Beckwith pays particular attention to culturally and socially unique aspects of steppe people. Rather than battles and treaties, he brings alive the interplay between the pastoralists and the settled, with a focus on how the former may have shaped the Weltanschauung of the latter. An ethnographic work, Empires of the Silk Road plumbs the deeper social structure beneath the scaffold of the narrative. Beckwith argues that steppe societies were founded on ideologies that eased group cohesion across tribes, rather than being simple blood-kin societies. In this way, he argues that steppe societies were more advanced than the farmerxe2x80x99s staid world, which was always destined to be narrowly delimited by village and locality.Beckwith does end on a slightly peculiar note, raging against modernity and modernism in his final chapter. But overall the book presents a strong, if idiosyncratic, case for the cultural centrality of the steppe.Give a gift subscriptionShareWhy a book on China on this list? I consider it essential to the story because you canxe2x80x99t write a history of China without writing about the steppe. The first chapters of F. W. Mottexe2x80x99s Imperial China 900-1800 delve deeply into the origins and lifestyle of the Khitan and Jurchen, steppe and steppe-adjacent tribes. The approach continues, as the Mongols and Manchu are central to the later narrative (the Manchu themselves descend from Jurchen). For Motte, engagement with the steppe is essential to understanding Chinese diplomacy and culture, and he makes no apologies for interleaving the history of steppe peoples with that of the Han Chinese.Imperial China 900-1800 reiterates the reality that the Eurasian heartland was a critical driver of change and adaptation in the competitor civilizations all around it, with China as a specific case study. The particular lessons can be applied just as well to other societies, including India, Iran and Russia.Give a gift subscriptionShareEmbedded within the pastoralist world of the Eurasian steppe are permanent settlements around which the course of the xe2x80x9cSilk Road'' is threaded. Since its concrete emergence 2,000 years ago, this artery of trade and information that slices through the heart of Eurasia has shaped the history of the world. Valerie Hansenxe2x80x99s The Silk Road: A New History is an urban and archaeology-focused tour of this lost world, with a spotlight on the Sogdians, the ancient Central Asian people that connected the west and the east in the millennium before 1000 A.D. Hansen digs through the material and economic importance of the cities of the eastern Silk Road and their importance to China. Though accessible to the general audience, The Silk Road is clearly academic in intent.Hansenxe2x80x99s story closes with the spread of Islam on the eastern steppe, because the Silk Road took on a new shape as its societies began to align with the West Asian religion. Before this, it existed in an equipoise between peripheral civilizations: Europe, Islam, and China. Given this, even though this is the most academic of my recommendations, I consider Hansenxe2x80x99s book essential reading to understand the world the Mongols exploded into around 1200 A.D.If you havenxe2x80x99t yet, take my Steppelandia Quiz!Now that nearly 5000 have tried their luck at the quiz, one thing Ixe2x80x99m surprised by is what people thought the steppe was responsible for.Ixe2x80x99m still trying to figure out if I can access raw data to look at the correlation between people who know their own steppe ancestry proportion and survey results. So far, if the 10% or so of test-takers who say they know their proportion of genetic steppe ancestry is reporting it accurately, I suspect a Clubhouse-esque over-representation of Indian male participants, compared to my usually European-skewed readership (as in far more <10% steppe than the 10-20% band)!Give a gift subscriptionShareFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.Have you read Peter Frankopan's The Silk Roads and what is your opinion on it?

Lee is skeptical of many of the politically convenient findings of his field. I found this one a sobering conversation. Lee also tells us about living through Hurricane Sandy, something which was on my mind when we recorded last week immediately after Austinxe2x80x99s snowstorm.- As usual, the Unsupervised Learning ungated podcast is up on a two-week delay.

These are all either freshly released or on their way in 2021.Give a gift subscriptionShareHumans are social organisms. So are many groups of insects. Most prominently, the order Hymenoptera, which includes ants and bees. Because of peculiarities of the genetic inheritance patterns of these insects, sisters within colonies are more genetically related to each other than they are to their own offspring. This is why workers stay to help their sisters rather than leave the colony to start their own nest. The great evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton focused on Hymenoptera as illustrations of his principle of inclusive fitness, where the reproductive output of relatives impacts onexe2x80x99s own evolutionary legacy.Insect societies share many features with human societies, in particular their massive scale and specialization of roles. This is why ants are such excellent models to explore questions of behavior and evolution. Susanne Foitzik and Olaf Fritsch in Empire of Ants provide the reader a guide to the whole of ant behavior and evolution. Foitzikxe2x80x99s career has been focused on the intersection of ant behavior, genetics, and evolution. Fritsch is a science writer with an extensive background in biological topics.Ready or not, we live in the era of the $1,000 genome. I expect the integration of genomics into health care to be one of the major stories of the 2020xe2x80x99s, so Euan Ashleyxe2x80x99s The Genome Odyssey: Medical Mysteries and the Incredible Quest to Solve Them is wonderfully timely. Ashleyxe2x80x99s career has witnessed personalized genomics go from a curiosity to mainstream. In 2009, he was part of a team that performed the first analysis of a genome for its medical relevance. At the time, this was a xe2x80x9cblue skyxe2x80x9d project, but over the next decade, it will be a road-map. The Genome Odyssey should be a good preview of the next decade of advances in health care.Give a gift subscriptionShareThere is no such thing as knowing too much about the Communist regime in China right now. It is hard to imagine the Peoplexe2x80x99s Republic of China as anything but a Communist Party regime, so tied up is the nation-statexe2x80x99s current identity with its ideology and the party that rules it. But this was not always the case. Even after World War II, there was no expectation that Communism would succeed in China. And yet over several years, the Communist armies conquered China, driving their Nationalist rivals to Taiwan. 1949 would be the year you would begin with to truly understand what happened. At the beginning of that year, the Nationalists controlled most of China. By the end, the Communists had proclaimed the Peoplexe2x80x99s Republic, and the Nationalists had fled to Taiwan. How did all that happen in one year? This is why Ixe2x80x99m looking forward to China 1949: Year of Revolution.The subtitle of The Horde, xe2x80x9cHow the Mongols Changed the Worldxe2x80x9d, looks a little counterintuitive. If you think of the Mongols, you usually think of Genghis Khan, and the classical Mongol world-empire of the 13th century. But this book seems to focus on the Golden Horde of Russia, founded by Genghis Khanxe2x80x99s oldest son, Jochi, and persisting in various forms for nearly three centuries. These were the Tatars who conquered and subjugated Russia for centuries. In doing so, they changed world history, because the expansive Russian Empire that emerged in the 16th century was fundamentally different from the Duchy of Moscow that preceded it. It had global ambitions, just like the Golden Horde which once ruled it.Give a gift subscriptionShareNo matter how brutal and amoral we perceive contemporary geopolitics to be, it is qualitatively different from what came before. During the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians declared xe2x80x9cthe strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.xe2x80x9d In the 17th century, half the population of Germany died during the Thirty Years War, which devolved into a conflict of all against all. In contrast, modern nation-states attempt to align themselves to a higher moral principle, and do not reduce all diplomacy to war. We have the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, and the International Convention on Human Rights. Over the past two centuries, despite horrific World Wars, Europe, and later the world, has experienced long periods of peace between nations. How did we reach this utopian state? It is the outcome of cultural forces with deep roots. The Conquest of Peace: From the Enlightenment to the European Union offers a narrative history of that process, going back to the abstract philosophies of the Enlightenment, and coming down to the concrete political reality of the modern world.William J. Bernsteinxe2x80x99s books are always compelling, but his latest, The Delusion of Crowds: why people go mad in groups, is particularly irresistible right now. Many others have written on the irrationality of herds and there are many historic examples of this phenomenon, from the Xhosa cattle-killing of the 19th century (the Xhosa starved) to various futile Crusades of the medieval period (the Crusaders were killed or enslaved). But this issue, the ability of group irrationality to overwhelm individual common sense, is constantly on display in todayxe2x80x99s social-media forums when polarization is heightened and in-group signaling threatens to become a full-time job in some circles.

Everyone in the US thinks that Russia is paranoid.  They have good reason to be so.  The Tartar yoke as a people's founding myth is a bit different than A Shining City on a Hill. Barbarian Empires of the Steppe in the Great Courses is wonderful.The book I'm most looking forward to this year is by Jeff Hawkins. His book On Intelligence from 2007 transformed my view of how brains work. To me, it finally provided a convincing overarching framework for how we think. Answering a very basic question. Mind is prediction, and your brain is constantly predicting what actions to take to make its preferred prediction happen. I think it stands up well, as this view has slowly become accepted since his book came out. In particular I think machine learning has indirectly made many people take this view, since ML essentially provides intuitions (predictions), but how those intuitions are formed is hidden knowledge from the ML model. Similarly, our minds give us intuitions, but we have no access to how those intuitions/predictions come about.Hawkins has a new book out in March, A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence. He takes some of his recent papers, and argues in book length form, that the brain (neocortex) has not a single model, but thousands of models, each interacting to predict and model the world. He's a good writer, very clear.He has some short videos on the book here, where he said his new book is stand alone, so doesn't require reading his old one. If you are interested, I'd suggest spending a few minutes listening to the before you decide if the new book is worth your time.https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/athousandbrainsAmazon link to book itself is here.

Data and infinite information might be at our collective fingertips, but who do we depend on to judiciously tend them? Who makes it their mission to remember dispassionately, to carry forward truths both flattering and inconvenient? Who among us actually knew in the first place? Perilously few, in my experience.I recently witnessed a scholar informing his audience that Xi Jinpingxe2x80x99s genocidal inclination towards the Uygurs distinguishes his regime from its Imperial Chinese forerunners who displayed no such maniacal tendencies, despite their cruelties. I objected that on the contrary Imperial China had been the author of multiple genocides of subject peoples over the millennia. He ignored me. A bystander to the conversation argued that Sinologists tend to be quite pro-China, so no one spotlights these awkward truths. He probably didn't know.Many would argue that wexe2x80x99re already deep into a post-fact era and the battle to actually remember anything but the blandest contours of our few millennia of human history has long since been ceded to a postmodern elite obsessed with facile disputes over race, victimology and their own most immediately accessible personal feelings.

Itxe2x80x99s probably no use, but itxe2x80x99s what I do.Youxe2x80x99re here reading me, so odds are, you do, too.

But us? We do it to ourselves. No onexe2x80x99s surveilling us to keep us from reading or remembering. We do it to ourselves.I have a dread suspicion this post, what should be a banal little act of recollection, will become a recurring feature on this Substack. Perhaps itxe2x80x99s a necessary role in an age of atrophy... scattering these occasional little oases of factual recollection across an arid landscape of righteous amnesia? All in hopes that the wiser inhabitants of some future age might hopscotch their way back to storehouses still packed with the millennia of human memory, fact and reflection we largely ignore.Give a gift subscriptionShareThe Forgotten GenocideToday there are twelve million Uyghurs in a nation of 1.4 billion Chinese, a fraction of a voiceless percent. The Chinese have imprisoned whole communities and are persecuting Uyghurs en masse. Reeducation camps, a tried and tested instrument in the toolkit of Communist societies for a century, dot Xinjiang today. Islam and the Uyghur language are called threats to the regime. Mosques are monitored. Children are consigned to Mandarin Chinese language schools. The Chinese Communist Party is executing a slow-rolling genocide.How can we understand this? We could look back to history. But that presupposes we know any.Too often, todayxe2x80x99s commentators lack the most basic familiarity with the lineaments of the Chinese past, even though it is copiously documented. Absent that basic knowledge, they make recourse to abstractions of European colonialism or lazily ascribe the inspiration for the current horror to Hitler or Stalin. They construe the actions of the Chinese purely in the light of Western history because that is the only interpretative lever they can operate.The reality is that Chinese history itself offers a clear example of genocide and repression on a mass scale to xe2x80x9cfixxe2x80x9d a political problem: the genocide of the Dzungar Mongols in the 18th century. This occurred in the northern half of todayxe2x80x99s Xinjiang: Dzungaria. Dzungaria was a territory named for a people who have since been ethnically cleansed from it. The genocide of the Dzungars reminds us that the template for government-sanctioned repression and violence of an ethnicity requires no Western influence. It is a feature of Chinese governance and has been for centuries.The Dzungar Khanate was the last of the great steppe empires. Less storied than the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan and the Turkic Empire of Tamerlane, it is now notable for the genocide that accompanied its destruction. After the Dzungar Khanate was erased, modern Chinaxe2x80x99s borders gained their final outline. This act concluded the geographical invention of China as we know it today.Give a gift subscriptionShareThe Great EnemyFor nearly 2,000 years, the empires of the steppe menaced the settled societies to their west, east, and south. Attila the Hun threatened the Romans, the Turks plundered northern India, and China was overwhelmed many times by horsemen from the north. But by the 1600xe2x80x99s, new weaponry had evened the playing field. The xe2x80x9cgunpowder empiresxe2x80x9d could slowly strangle the tribes of the open steppe, one canon volley at a time.Squeezed ever more tightly between the rising powers of Tsarist Russia and Manchu China, the ultimate demise of the Dzungar Khanate was achieved through the genocide of the constituent tribes. Between 1755 and 1757 80% of the Dzungars died or were killed through the concerted action of Manchu-led forces, ending centuries of conflict and decades of rebellion. Dzungaria, the northern half of modern-day Xinjiang, was thus emptied of Mongols and resettled with Kazakhs and Uyghurs.The official modern definition of genocide includes xe2x80x9cacts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.xe2x80x9d Manchu authorities issued official orders and exhortations to attempt total extermination. A non-European power committed this act long before the modern era. Genocide requires no connection to European ideologies of colonialism or the lethal force of machine guns.The rise of the DzungarsThe Dzungars were not only the last of the Mongol Empires, they were also marginal Mongols. The Dzungar confederacy was a fusion of the Olot, Torghut, Dxc3xb6rbet and Khoshut tribes, collectively called the Oirats. During the time of Genghis Khan, the Oirats were forest-dwellers, on the southern edge of Siberia, not part of the nomadic societies to their south that joined the Mongol horde. They did not share in the glory of the conquests. Ethnically, Dzungars who survived the genocide remain distinct from the majority of Mongols who were ruled by descendants of Genghis Khan, the Khalkha Mongols.Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the Oirats were often at war with the Khalkha Mongols. The Khalkha had prestige and legitimacy on their side. The Oirats had the fact that they were hardier, tougher, and their elites less exposed to the comforts of wealth. In other words, the Oirat advantage over the Khalkha Mongols was the advantage the Khalkha Mongols had once had over their enemies.By the end of the 17th century, the Oirat tribes who had become the Dzungars gained the upper hand. In 1691, the Khalkha Mongols forestalled surrendering to the Dzungars by submitting themselves to the new rulers of China: the Manchus.Give a gift subscriptionShareThe rise of the ManchusThe Manchus were a coalition of tribes that occupied the forest zone to the east of Mongolia, what we today call Manchuria in northeast China. The Manchus understood empire and conquest. Between 1115 and 1234, their ancestors, the Jurchen, ruled northern China as the Jin dynasty. That dynasty was destroyed by the Mongol invasion from the north.In the subsequent centuries, the Jurchen tribes reinvented themselves as the Manchu, and established alliances with the Khalkha Mongols, in their ancient home of Manchuria. In the mid-17th century, the collapse of the Ming dynasty presented another opportunity. Between 1644 and 1659 the Manchus conquered China. Within the borders of Imperial China, they ruled as Chinese Emperors, founding the Qing dynasty. Emperor Kangxi reigned as an exemplary Confucian monarch between 1661 and 1722, and his six-decade regime helped inspire a wave of early-Enlightenment Sinophilia in Europe. China embodied to many of the philosophers of the age the possibility of secular, enlightened despotism administered by rational bureaucrats.But there was another side of the Qing: outside of the borders of the Chinese heartland they were Manchurian warlords. Kangxi devoted multiple months of the year to hunting, a pastime of the steppe and forest zone, not an avocation typical of Chinese Emperors. Unlike native Chinese, the Manchus had a deep relationship to Tibetan Buddhism, which led to the Manchu absorption of Tibet into their domains in 1720.The Manchus had assimilated to many of the folkways of the steppe. They were comfortable with the culture of the nomads to their west. The Khalkha Mongols were an essential part of the Manchu military class. In the 19th century, Mongol generals played a role in suppressing rebellions in China proper.Manchu entanglement with Tibetan Buddhism and the Khalkha Mongols made conflict with the Dzungar tribes inevitable. The Manchus stood between the Dzungars and their ambition to bring together all the Mongol people under their leadership. In the centuries after the decline of the Mongol Empire, the scions of Genghis Khan had become habituated to a certain level of luxurious living which left them less ferocious fighters than their lean and hungry Dzungar cousins. Over the centuries, the Khalkha had lost ground to the Dzungars. On the eve of their abrupt pivot to an alliance with the Manchus, there was no viable independent path forward between the two rising powers.Both the Manchus and Dzungar were devotees of Tibetan Buddhism. The Dzungar interference in the affairs of Tibet was alarming to Manchu rulers who cultivated and relied upon the legitimacy of Buddhist Lamas. After their conquest of China, the Manchu had men and materiel beyond the wildest expectations of any steppe warlord. They went into the conflict with enormous advantages.Give a gift subscriptionShareA rebellious peopleThe Dzungar Khanate was a predatory steppe polity. Unlike the extensive bureaucratic states emerging on the fertile edges of Eurasia, the steppe produced societies that were more often simply a collection of tribes bound together by personal loyalties. In this way, they were primal, ancient throwbacks to something deeply premodern. But for two thousand years, the steppe people also remained state-of-the-art in their military technology: mounted warriors who could traverse great distances and strategically retreat whenever the battle turned against them. With powerful compound bows, they could shoot while mounted, thanks to a lifetime in the saddle.It was often far easier for settled societies to pay tribute to the people of the steppe than resist their incessant raiding. The East Romans paid tribute to the Huns, and so succeeded in deflecting the attention of these invaders away to the west. Similarly, it was usually far more cost-effective for Chinese emperors to provide xe2x80x9cgiftsxe2x80x9d to their steppe allies rather than engage in resource-sapping wars.This is the historical precedent into which the Dzungars stepped. Their ferocity meant that they easily established hegemony over the Muslim people of the Tarim basin, whom we today call Uyghurs. These urban Muslims resented rule by capricious Buddhist nomads, and they welcomed liberation by the Manchus.Dzungar mobility meant they also interfered in the religious politics of Tibet incessantly and at will for decades. The title Dalai Lama was conferred initially by a Mongol ruler in the 16th century. By the end of the 17th century, the Dzungars were manipulating and controlling succession in the Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy. It looked as if Tibet would be absorbed entirely by the Dzungars, just as the cities of the Tarim basin had been.The Dzungar-Qing WarsThe years between 1687 and 1757 saw a series of conflicts between the Dzungars, and the Qing dynasty. The war came to an end only when Emperor Qianlong, a man even more cultured than his grandfather Kangxi, demanded the liquidation of the Dzungars as a nation.In response to the recalcitrance of some of his subordinates to carry out the full extent of his dictates, Qianlong ordered the following proclamation be read out:Show no mercy at all to these rebels. Only the old and weak should be saved. Our previous military campaigns were too lenient. If we act as before, our troops will withdraw, and further trouble will occur. If a rebel is captured and his followers wish to surrender, he must personally come to the garrison, prostrate himself before the commander, and request surrender. If he only sends someone to request submission, it is undoubtedly a trick. Tell Tsengxc3xbcnjav to massacre these crafty Zunghars. Do not believe what they say.Of 600,000 Dzungars, up to 480,000 may have died. A 19th-century Chinese historian estimated that 30% of the Dzungar households were directly killed by the Qing armies. Another 40-50% died of disease and starvation. The remainder fled to the Russian Empire or took refuge with the Kazakhs.The closing of the frontier and the rise of the gunQing victory over the Dzungar was total. The Dzungar nation lost its ability to resist and rebel. This marked the arrival of the Eurasian heartland into the modern geopolitical system. Before the rise of the Qing and the expansion of Russia into the Eurasian interior, the vast zone had been occupied by mobile nomads and hunters. There were no true borders on the map, there was territory occupied and inhabited. The nomadic response to encroachment was to fight or retreat at the first sign of weakness. They rarely took any significant losses due to their customary strategic depth.But the partitioning of Central Asia by Imperial China to the east and Imperial Russia to the west closed off all avenues of retreat to the Dzungar. The nomadsxe2x80x99 attempt to play Russia off against the Qing met with mixed success at best. The Russians knew a vigorous coalition of nomadic warriors could cause them trouble in the future. They remembered being ruled by Tatar nomads.With the development and spread of firearms, nomadic advantages in warfare also diminished. Modern states with extensive systems of logistics were more effective in fielding large armies for long periods in distant locales. The Qing wore down the Dzungar, and ultimately the campaign of genocide left Dzungar soldiers no homes to retreat to.Give a gift subscriptionShareRationality and the total stateThe Qing dynasty ruled a China that was heir to thousands of years of Confucian statecraft. But the Manchus remained a cosmopolitan and imperial people who also operated outside of the boundaries of Chinese thought and precedent. In 1691, they signed the Treaty of Nerchinsk, which established a border with the Russian Empire. Their patronage of Tibetan Buddhism was not in keeping with Chinese tradition, but unsurprising from a people of the eastern steppe and forest, who had shifted from shamanism to the religion of the Tibetan Lamas in the decades after 1500. It also allowed them to absorb and integrate Tibet into the Chinese Empire for the first time in history.The destruction of the Dzungar Khanate also established the western border of the Manchu Empire in what the Chinese today call Xinjiang, literally xe2x80x9cNew Border.xe2x80x9d Whereas earlier Chinese Empires had been content to watch their influence gradually fade into the steppe and desert to the north and west, the Manchus established clear lines and borders all around the perimeter of their domains. Though distinct from the Westphalian tradition of Europe, the Manchus rationalized the geography of China so that it transitioned easily into the modern era. Today's internationally recognized borders of the People's Republic of China are the outlines ruthlessly carved by the Manchu Empire.The Manchu victory over the Dzungars was not due to their particular skill or ferocity in the arts of war. Rather, they deployed the whole might of the Chinese nation and various allied peoples (Manchus, Mongols, and Turks) against the Dzungar in a war of attrition. Modern weaponry erased the long-held advantage of the steppe nomad against the Chinese infantry on a man-for-man basis. Science, engineering, and modern politics conquered the steppe and exterminated the Dzungar.The greatest human stainThe reason European philosophers like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Voltaire admired China is that it seemed to be a rational empire. Voltaire also envied what he perceived to be the subordination and marginalization of religion in Chinese statecraft, in contrast to the coordination that was typical in Europe at the time.This was an indigenous development within China, ruled by the Manchus, a non-Chinese people. It was part of a broader arc of economic and political progress across the world, as states rationalized themselves, and scientific and engineering principles unblocked long-standing stalemates. The process bore its full fruit in Europe, which conquered the world. But the example of China in the 18th century illustrates that elements of it were present at the other end of Eurasia.The Dzungar genocide, and its resemblance to later atrocities under Americans, Turks, and of course Germans, shows that no time, people, or place is any guarantee against inhumane behavior. The Manchus had experienced decades of rebellion and recalcitrance on the part of the Dzungar. Their ultimate solution was to end the Dzungar as a people, thereby unburdening themselves of the long war. This was simple logic.The Uyghurs have been far less violent and problematic for the Peoplexe2x80x99s Republic of China than the Dzungar Khanate was for Qing China. But the power and totality of the modern state have progressed far beyond the 18th century. The reach and encroachment of the modern surveillance and police states are like nothing Qianlong could imagine. Instead of exhortations to obey, all that is needed today is a decree specifying that authorities should xe2x80x9cshow absolutely no mercyxe2x80x9d to the Uyghur xe2x80x9cseparatists.xe2x80x9d And like that, the mechanism of the modern totalitarian state snaps into motion, a blur of bureaucratic paperwork and punctilious attention to the details of slowly destroying another race of humans. When we in the West react with incomprehension to the horror unfolding in those remote outposts, we need to realize it is not without precedent. It is not an act of capricious evil, but a calculated decision. Genocide was built into the foundations of Xinjiang itself, the contested soil suffused with the blood of the exterminated Dzungar people. Ixe2x80x99m hardly one to exhort anyone to do anything. But ours is an age when earnest Americans announce unbidden whose stolen native lands they occupy as readily as they proclaim their pronouns. So could we just supplement our long-distance concern and hand-wringing with a thought for the actual facts of the western frontierland of China? Xinjiang is Dzungar land emptied of Dzungars. And now it looks poised to be emptied of their Uyghur successors. Sadly, genocide, that darkest of human stains, is not a recent Western invention, but Made In China, too.Give a gift subscriptionShareFor your security, we need to re-authenticate you.Click the link we sent to , or click here to log in.A good write up but in the prologue and conclusion you commit the usual western fallacy of equating culture-cide and geno-cide. They aren't the same (though often go hand in hand). This false equality is at the root of western inability to confront barbarian cultures in their midst. After all saying bad things about culture inevitably means genocide. But the two concepts are distinct. Killing memes is not killing people. If Chinese manage to eradicate Islam from Western Turkestan (or utterly neuter it) - good for them and congratulations. If they manage to do it without killing people who don't fight them - there is no moral problem with what they are doing. If, on the other hand, they kill indiscriminately with the intent to \"kill them all\" this would be something to object to. It is hard to tell given the abysmal quality of \"reporting\" from these areas but it seems that Chinese are doing the former rather than the latter. I'm afraid the more recent American schoolyard chestnut \"he who smelt it, dealt it\" better explains the convenient \"amnesia\" we see in the west.Just to illustrate the point...take a look at a map of Xinjiang. It happens to be right next to...Afghanistan. The country where for two decades, the locals have been subject to western re-education, airstrikes, torture, and weapons testing (remember the \"M.O.A.B.\"??).Furthermore...take a look at a map of oil reserves in China. Xinjiang happens to have the biggest \"blob of black\". Curiously similar big \"blobs of black\" happen to trapped under regions where the west has \"human rights\" based regime change policies (Venezuela, Iran, Iraq). President Trump (who I actually like) says \"we're not so innocent - and we're going to take the oil!\". It happens right in front of our eyes in Syria...and rather than any discussions about boycotts of American goods & sanctions on their leaders...you get brave academic dissertations about the benefits of stealing Syrian wheat on top the oil!   Having said all this...you don't want \"culture-cide\" of the Uighur's (sorry Eugene G.!). They're beautiful people, beautiful women, beautiful dresses, beautiful dances. But more importantly, this world needs more \"conservative\" types with strong family values. Eugene compares them to \"barbarians\". But when American culture consists of Disney-owned ABC & NFL star Michael Strahan celebrating \"Bacha Bazi\" on national television...ain't that \"backwards\"? (ever heard of Sodom and Gomorrah??). Certainly more backwards than anything I've heard the Uighur's accused of!You ask me (no one does, on account of being a highschool dropout) the key to \"saving the Uighur's\" is being sincere. You can't have the desire to cripple China in your heart - while spouting hypocritical sanctimony from your mouth. You can't unfairly personalize this issue around Xi Jinping xe2x80x8b- because you want to protect your future ability to do business in China.If I (to reiterate, a highschool dropout) can see through it...then of course the Chinese see through it. And that's not helping anyone. We need to have man-to-man relationships, crude jokes, and possibly some innocent misogyny. It's what we used to call \"diplomacy\" (before those jobs became rewards for friends & funders).Without getting into specifics (probably because I want one of those \"reward\" appointments lol!) there are successful eastern examples of \"fundamentalist Islamic communities\" being integrated into \"secular\" nation-states. The peoples retain their \"hard\" culture & identity...yet end up becoming loyal & valuable resources for the state & military. It's the key to \"saving the Uighur's\" & \"preventing a genocide/culturecide\"...yet not one western \"scholar\" has considered or proposed such a solution.No posts","title":"Made in China - Razib Khan's Unsupervised Learning","url":"https://razib.substack.com/p/made-in-china"}
