{"id":"0","text":"What is bottom up?When starting out, founders of software companies often contemplate whether it’s better to pursue a consumer or enterprise idea. Actually, this is a trick question. The perfect software business is a hybrid. It monetizes like an enterprise product but spreads like a consumer product.I call this Bottom-Up SaaS. This is a category I pioneered with Yammer by taking the product-led growth tactics I had learned as founding COO of PayPal and applying them to enterprise software. Yammer’s revenue grew so quickly that it was acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion in under 4 years. Today, Bottom-Up SaaS is a vibrant category that includes dozens of companies. Most recently, the IPOs of companies like Zoom and Slack have shown how much value can be created when ARR is combined with viral growth. In this blog, I convey the lessons learned about Bottom-Up SaaS through my experience as a founder/CEO and as an investor in many SaaS companies. I try to write about topics relevant to founders starting or scaling software companies. Everyone has to start somewhere. You might as well work your way from the Bottom Up. That is where change comes from. That is where revolutions come from.Subscribe ","url":"https://sacks.substack.com/about"}

Pitching in the heavy seas, the admiral held his planes until just before dawn when they were 60 miles offshore. Then, while still in complete darkness, 152 planes took off.Just as the new day’s sunlight was finally hitting the island, the planes emerged from the clouds to find the world’s greatest naval base helplessly asleep beneath them.Fighters led the charge, strafing across the airfield, knocking out the planes on the ground before any aerial defense could lift off. With air domination achieved, dive bombers and torpedo planes freely followed, raining down on the vessels in the harbor. Not a single one was left unscathed.”Richard Feynman & The Feynman Learning Technique“While not stated explicitly by the man himself, the Feynman Learning Technique finds its inspiration in the life of Richard Feynman. He was constantly learning, teaching, tearing apart, and then reorganizing the various things he found interesting.Because of this and his good-hearted, tireless sharing of the outcomes with others, Feynman is remembered not only for his work in physics but even more so for the beautiful mind and quirky personality that made him who he was…”A Stoic Philosopher in a Hanoi Prison“Stockdale had no reason to think that the day’s mission was to be anything unique.The flight in September 1965 was part of his third combat tour of North Vietnam, serving as Wing Commander of the aircraft carrier Oriskany. Despite his misgivings about the purpose of him being in Vietnam, he was a competent and skilled career fighter pilot. Nothing suggested he shouldn’t expect to make it back home that day - let alone that decade.But sometimes life deals you a lousy hand, and it dealt Stockdale quite an unhappy one.While trying to aid trapped American soldiers on the ground, he was suddenly falling out of the sky and hurtling towards a small Vietnamese village. His plane was on fire, the control system shot out by North Vietnamese who had used the grounded soldiers as bait, and he didn’t have much choice beyond punching out of the plane.After ejection, I had about 30 seconds to make my last statement in freedom before I landed in the main street of a little village right ahead. And, so help me, I whispered to myself: \"Five years down there, at least. I'm leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus.\"Just like that, Stockdale’s day had gone from routine to disastrous - but why was the first thing to jump into his mind the ancient philosopher, Epictetus?…”Perseverance is Great, But Don’t Forget to Prepare“And as you think through how impossible these challenges sound, you are met with the realization of how quickly you would fail participating in the same. But then you have to be honest with yourself - you wouldn't just fail, you would, in fact, die. You would get lost in the mountains. You would fall off a cliff. You would try to make the 40-miles and breakdown before you ever got to the end. And this highlights another useful takeaway - unending resolve is not enough to ensure success. You must also be competent. All the perseverance you can muster today won't do anything for you if you haven't lived a life up to today that has prepared you for the task at hand - who you are today is a lagging indicator of who you have been.This means that success can only come after persistent preparation. The 163 men selected for the tryouts had lived lives that prepared them to take the unique, once-in-a-lifetime Delta Force opportunity and try. Without preparation, they could not even hope to try…”Habits Maketh the Man (and Un-Maketh Him, Too)“Life is complex. Chaotic. Surprising. Uncertain. It is full of new things — many of which can kill us. And that’s a problem, because we humans tend to prefer not dying. Fortunately, we have been practicing surviving for quite some time and have developed a way to cut down on that chaos with a bit of order: the ability to form habits. However, and unfortunately for those humans looking for more in life than just survival, these habits often have more control over us than we have control over them.So what are habits and why do they control us? Jason Hreha, a behavioral scientist who writes about life and business, summarizes that “habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” They are unconscious programs that free up our conscious mind to solve those non-recurring new problems that are constantly thrown our way. It’s too mentally expensive to try to figure out what you should do every day when you get home from work — it’s much easier to have a program that loads without you knowing and tells you to change clothes. Putting on running shoes loads the running program. Smelling alcohol loads the drinking program. The important takeaway is that whether you notice them or not, the habits are running. This means that, for better or for worse, your habits are in charge of who you are in the future…”ShareSubscribeBut What For?

{"id":"5","text":"Welcome to Blue Mars. I’m Vignesh and I’ll be your guide.This is primarily a newsletter that will carry my commentary on technology and topics in the periphery of technology. The letters can generally be considered opinion pieces (one that’s personal and not that of my employer). I’ll also try to present an objective view of what I’m talking about so you can form opinions of your own.Why is this newsletter called Blue Mars?Blue Mars is the third book in the Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson. If you like sci-fi or fantasy sci-fi, go read it if you haven’t already. In short, it’s about how a civilization takes shape in Mars, our friendly neighborhood planet. The first two books — Red Mars and Green Mars — are about how the civilization settles down, and Blue Mars is about what happens after the settlement has been made possible.There’s war and other themes in the book, but what I’m interested is the question of “what happens after all the technological advancements we’ve dreamed up have actually come true?”So, as a parable to the world we live in, Blue Mars largely deals with the after effects of what could be considered the pinnacle of human technological achievement. I first wanted to call this 'techtopia’ but (un)fortunately that was taken. So I got reminded of this series that I’d read in my late teens/early twenties. I believe it captures the essence of what I want to talk about in this newsletter — the world after technology has become commonplace and the constant pursuit towards more and more utility for the same.Why should you listen to my opinion?Fair question. I am a software engineer by profession. For the last five years or so I’ve been spending my time building distributed systems for storage at AWS. So I sort of have a cockpit view of a technology spaceship.I also pretty much grew up online and I consider myself to be a reasonably keen observer of trends. I like writing, and I like technology, so here you have yet another newsletter with a tech tag.What do you get if you subscribe?I will try provide bite-sized, regular updates on the zeitgeist (think weekly or bi-weekly) while writing a longform piece or two once a month. This is an experiment, so the newsletter will evolve along with my writing. It’s free, at least for now, so let’s find out together.What do you not get?Spam, ads, sponsored links, or a sales pitch. I love my job. It pays well. This place is for me to feel heard and calibrate my compass to see if I have what it takes to make the right claims.Sign up now so you don’t miss the next issue!

{"id":"6","text":"Welcome To The Commonplace NewsletterThis is what you have been looking for. An Oasis of art in a desert of ‘Content’. A place away from the noise and the news cycle where we can talk about art, philosophy, leisure and living the good life.A sanctuary from the hustle culture. If that isn’t a powerful enough motivator, then read on and learn exactly what I have to offer…Why Subscribe To The Basic LevelThe internet of the present moment is a strange place. Centralised, algorithm-driven, polarised, divisive, un-nuanced. It’s a mess of listicles and unboxings and reaction videos and the same tired memes and slang hammered home again and again and again.It’s enough to drive a person mad.And if you look at the studies that is exactly what it seems to be doing. Stress, anxiety, professional burnout, frayed relationships, dopamine addictions, and atrophied attention spans seem to be more prevalent than ever. The Web 2.0 world of likes and retweets and vitriol and trolls and hustle and ‘content’ has collectively done a number on us. Everyday I see airbud and screen-tapping phone zombies, their faces blank, their minds elsewhere, constantly scrolling for something that they can never quite find.And honestly, this is not a knock on young people. I hear daily from people of all ages who have been sucked in just as deeply. If anything my audience demographics have an ever so slight Zoomer bias, as these young people see the present world of ‘content’ for the bland sham that it is.They want more. Better.And that is what I am here to offer.They say you should be the change you want to see, and that is exactly what I have been doing here week after week. I am just as tired of intelligence insulting content as you are, so I have committed myself to publishing a quality, in-depth, long form essay each Sunday. The response so far (just look at the comment section on any of my essays) speaks for itself. These pieces I put out aren’t just knee-jerk reactions to the news cycle or anodyne bulletpoints of self-improvement pablum. This is not writing about writing for other aspiring writers. This is the real thing. Essays on life itself- philosophy, culture, literature, nature- drawn from experience and observation not mere bestseller self-help quotation.If that intrigues you, and if you want to join the 2000 strong Commonplace Newsletter audiences you can sign up for free. Sign up and you will get these weekly essays sent directly to your inbox each Sunday. The perfect accompaniment to the day of rest.SubscribeAnd this is only the basic level...The Offer- Why Subscribe To The Premium CommunityA cozy pub awaits.I often receive emails and messages asking for advice on how to improve writing. I see the same mistakes again and again and again. The most common one is this- the writer focuses on their own ego and its gratification and in doing so they neglect the audience. I won’t make that mistake here. Because the community I am building via this Substack is not merely about me, it is about you and what I can do for you.This is what The Offer is all about. You.If you are tired of the aspects of contemporary web culture that I listed above- the bland, centralised, corporate, algorithm-driven, polarised, divisive, un-nuanced, unintelligent lowest-ommon-denominator world of ‘Content’- then I have the solution for you. If you want to transcend this then my exclusive Discord community is the place for you. The fact that there is a small cover charge, so to speak, means that there is no need for gamification, metrics, likes, virality, polarisation or any of that nonsense. Rather than bland and impersonal advertisements disguised as ‘content’, rather than screaming into the void, the Commonplace Community Discord exists at human scale. It is like a cozy local pub where you can chat about life and work and art and the weather in private and in peace and at your leisure.Their is no need to perform for an audience of faceless strangers on the off-chance of going viral. You can relax. You can be yourself.Regulars at ‘The Pub’ include poets, designers, surfers, boxers, poker players, guys who work on spreadsheets, gals who edit magazines, investors, NEETS, successful authors, and everyone in between. People from all walks of life and all ages spread across several continents and all getting along and being civil and sharing a few laughs. The way the internet should be.And when people sign up to this premium experience a strange thing happens. When people start dropping in to the pub they stop (mis)using the rest of the internet so much. In fact they:Start reading more real books (we have a monthly club, we have many prolific readers and writers on board)Start going on more walks in natureNotice their creativity significantly improves Become less stressedSpend less time passively looking at screensEnjoy life moreSubscribeHere’s a brief sampling of what I mean...Here’s one introductionAnd anotherAnd another, that really nails the way things are moving…Strolling > ScrollingReading real books > reading contentNow I could spend all day posting screenshots from ‘The Pub’. There are scores of smart and insightful regulars saying wise things about all manner of topics.I could do that. But the truth is that what makes the place so special, and something that I am so proud of is the general vibe of it. The intangible aspect. You will see what I mean when you join us over there.Subscribe‘But Wait, There’s More…’The above is the core of the offer and to my mind it clearly and easily justifies the small price, the equivalent of buying me a single beer at the bar each month.But for the sake of completion I should tell you that besides access to this extraordinary community you will also gain access to:Exclusive audio postsExclusive reviews and other one off piecesFree digital versions of every book I releaseFirst opportunity to buy limited edition hardback runs not available anywhere elseThe smug satisfaction of knowing you are a patron of the arts supporting a real writerThe ability to pester me with questions about writing (or anything else) in the #neverending-q-and-a Discord channelBook, movie and music recs better than any algorithm could dream upAll for the monthly cost of a beer.Now, I’m a big believer in the 1000 True Fans theory. In fact, my whole writing career will be an exercise in proving its viability and legitimacy. Now, if you want to see how that works from the ground up, if you want to be a part of that from the beginning as well as gaining access to everything mention above then simply follow the link below.If you’ve made it this far you ‘get it’.

At my day job I am a part of a team that applies data, behavioral insights, and entrepreneurial grit to make the world a better place under the guidance of Freakonomics’ Steve Levitt.

I’ll hope you’ll join me in exploring those curiosities.

{"id":"31","text":"About Perspective Agents‘Perspective Agents’ is a public notepad looking into sensemaking as a growth strategy. I believe it’s the next big thing as the world deals with the fallout of attention-at-all costs media and coping with COVID-19. It builds on and informs Media Genius and client projects I work on leading innovation at Weber Shanwick. What is Media Genius and why mention it?Perspective Agents is a complement to Media Genius, a research and learning platform I created with colleagues at Weber Shandwick. That is where I publish most of my writing, focused on the fusion of media and tech — implications on society. I also occasionally drop some thoughts into Medium. What can you find here?As I research the transition to a perspective age, stuff I find interesting enough to highlight or share will live here. The links will be media-heavy, but also include blurbs on AI, economics, psychology, history, and current affairs. Why beyond links why is this relevant to follow?I’ll do my best to post relevant topics based on tons of primary/secondary research from our teams as well as time spent deep inside the new media ecosystem and venture community.  Who am I to judge? My work history and homework could help your own research and information pursuits. I’ve spent twenty years helping our company and clients embrace new interaction models and means to add value in a digital context.  Over this period I’ve exceeded the 10,000-hour mark, meetings with Fortune 100 companies, new and legacy media companies, social networks, media research teams AI companies, and more. Why does my own perspective matter?This accumulated experience, along with working practice as well as studying technology effects on media and society, tells me we’re on the cusp of a revolution in perspective we haven’t seen in a century—or longer.I also like the notion of finding undiscovered gems…forgotten movements, ideas, and perspectives worthy of sharing.

It’s about the interaction between technology and society, the impacts of the transitions flowing through the globe but also about the pandemic that’s transforming the world. Insight is a place for complicated, in-depth discussions that don’t constantly hedge and hem-and-haw defensively but also don’t undersell the uncertainty. Discussions that are practical in their orientation but honest in acknowledging ambiguity and unknowns about the world’s massive challenges. Discussions that treat the reader as a partner in thinking. Insight is about the thinking we can do at the intersections between disciplines and methods, bringing together the science and the technology, people and society, recognizing the complexity and ambiguity of it all.

{"id":"42","text":"Who Are You?I’m Ken White.  I’m an attorney in Los Angeles, California, where I’m a partner in a small firm practicing criminal defense and civil litigation.  I began my career as a federal prosecutor, and for the last twenty years have defended people in state and federal criminal proceedings and represented them as both plaintiffs and defendants in a wide range of civil matters, with a growing focus on First Amendment issues. I’m also a husband of 23 years and a father to three children, all adopted internationally.  I am a ridiculously fortunate person.What Do You Write About?I mostly write about criminal justice and free speech issues.  I enjoy writing “lawsplainers” — attempts to make somewhat esoteric legal issues clear and entertaining to non-lawyers (and to reasonably tolerant lawyers).  I also like to talk about the gulf between what the law is supposed to do and what it actually does.  I’ve written a lot about federal criminal law, the criminal investigations surrounding the Trump Administration, First Amendment disputes and adjacent cultural disputes, and the intersection of free speech law and the internet.Where Have You Written or Spoken? Since 2004, I wrote at the blog Popehat, which is now mostly defunct.  For the last ten years or so, I’ve written a lot on Twitter.  I’ve been published in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Reason Magazine, and I’ve been a Contributing Writer at The Atlantic.  I’m the host of the First Amendment podcast Make No Law, and the cohost of KCRW’s All the President’s Lawyers, a podcast about the Trump Administration’s legal travails.  I also do speeches and debates on free speech and criminal justice issues.About The Name “Popehat”I was raised Catholic.  But the name “Popehat” is an inside joke among online friends and not an actual reference to religion.  A friend make origami miters and wore them playing poker.  When so clad, he seemed invincible.  Popehat is a reference to that attitude of infallibility that seems to be a prerequisite to writing online.Do You Have Suggestions, Questions, Threats, Or Abuse?Please feel free to write me at ken@popehat.com.Obligatory DisclaimerI do things other than bloviate online.

{"id":"46","text":"Kanji in English ContextIs a method of teaching Kanji to an English-comprehending audience first created by Hake Hayashi for the online rapid fluency acquisition curriculum Japanese Complete.Sign up and stay connectedEvery month we send out one or more kanji lessons using Kanji in English Context to help show how easy it is to start learning how to differentiate kanji.  After all, they were used for their glyphic value when being imported to Japan and Japanese culture.  Why not use them in a similar way in English?  What’s the gist?Basically, kanji are used to mask certain Japanese “letters” (mora if we want to get technical).  When kanji are used as a mask, they add a certain amount of flavor, texture, and context to an otherwise only-phonetic language (Japanese with just Hiragana or just Katakana).We have found that people can start recognizing kanji meanings very quickly, provided they have a familiar context.

{"id":"47","text":"About The Resident ContrarianThis is a blog about looking a little closer at arguments. Every post takes a look at the way a particular position is being promoted and tries to break it down a bit, looking for flaws or things that aren’t as presented. It’s necessarily a little nit-picky.I don’t always disagree with the conclusions or positions the subject of the article is taking, but I think that how we convince is about as important as what we try to convince people of. I think and hope that this improves the work of the people I’m addressing.The blog is necessarily minimally charitable. I’m not going to assume the worst of the authors I challenge, but I’m also not going to ignore probable reasons why something is wrong that are less nice or polite than “well, this might just be a simple mistake”.  Motives can often be significant to understanding an argument; I will typically assume the motive that looks the most likely is true.I am not without biases, and I make mistakes.

{"id":"56","text":"The Tech Effect is about dispelling myths and explaining truths in the world of tech.SubscribeShare The Tech EffectTHE WORLD IS BURNING! Well, not quite. But it’s pretty damn close. This newsletter is your best chance to stay informed about the newest developments in the world of technology and what they mean for us (humans).  They say the things that are closest to us are the hardest to see, and that is the case with our technology: It’s everywhere, invading every space, and taking away freedoms we never thought could be taken away. Yet we hardly critique it and seem to know next to nothing about its inner-workings or the people behind the tech. That is the disconnect that this newsletter aims to mend, uncovering some of the hidden truths behind the technological curtain while revealing the most important myths about technology in order to give you a new perspective on The Tech Effect. Each newsletter will be different: Some will explore current news or ongoing developments in the world of technology, such as explaining how Facebook and Google’s advertising algorithms work and how they influence elections. Others will analyze thinkers and ideologies that pertain to the subject of technology, such as technological determinism, surveillance capitalism, cyborgs, and nihilism. Some will even feature interviews with experts.Oren Weisfeld studied Media, Information & Technoculture at Western University before becoming a writer.
